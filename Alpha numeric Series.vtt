Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on alpha numeric series.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.490
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.760
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.660
Explanation.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.280
Alpha numeric series, my friend,
is quite simply a sequence.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.720
Think of it like a secret code
made up of a delightful combination

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.060
of letters, numbers, and symbols.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.730
These elements aren't
just thrown in randomly.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.099
Oh no.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.870
They're arranged in a very particular
pattern, and our main mission

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.280
should you choose to accept it, is
to identify that clever pattern.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.030
Why?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.489
Well, to either find a missing element,
figure out an element's precise position,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.200
or just answer general questions
based on how everything is arranged.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:52.995
This whole exercise you see is a
fantastic way to test your ability

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:57.644
to observe, analyze and quickly
spot those logical relationships.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:03.044
It's like being a detective, but
for patterns, real world relevance.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:06.914
Now, why is this important for
you, my friend, aiming for those?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.270
Coveted positions.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.070
As someone aspiring to be an officer,
you'll constantly need to quickly

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.500
analyze and interpret data patterns.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.509
Imagine sifting through financial
reports or heaps of customer information.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.280
This topic, alpha numeric series,
seriously enhances your pattern

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.020
recognition skills, which are absolutely
crucial for efficient data handling,

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:34.429
and of course, brilliant problem
solving in all banking operations.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.950
So it's not just for the exam,
it's for your future desk job, too.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.900
Breakdown of question types based
on past exam patterns for your

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.850
exam's, reasoning ability section.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.110
We see a few reoccurring question
formats for alpha numeric series.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.370
First up, we have the mixed
series questions, which make up a

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.830
good 40 to 50% of the questions.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.900
These present a series with a real
mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.899
You'll be asked to identify elements
based on their position from a specific

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.220
end count elements with certain
properties, or even find elements

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.470
nestled between two given elements.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.209
Then around 20 to 25% are
letter series questions.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
These focus solely on a sequence of
letters, often based on their alphabetical

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.049
position, maybe some skipped letters,
or even a clever combination of these.

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:30.305
Don't worry, we'll master them.

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:35.525
Following closely, about 15 to
20% are number series questions.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.515
These involve sequences of numbers
where the pattern might be an

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:43.505
arithmetic progression, like a
simple addition or subtraction, a

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:48.365
geometric progression, multiplication
or division, prime numbers, squares,

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:51.125
cubes, or even a mix of operations.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:53.435
The numbers can be quite playful.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:57.705
Less frequent, but still important
are symbol series questions,

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:00.045
making up about five to 10%.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:04.335
These involve patterns related
specifically to symbols, their

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:08.940
positions, or how they transform a bit
like understanding hieroglyphs, but.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.000
Easier, and then it's the classic odd
one out question, making up five to 7%.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.770
Here you are given a set of elements,
usually four or five, and your

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
job is to identify that cheeky
element that simply doesn't follow

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.620
the same patterns as the others.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.560
It's like finding the
black sheep in the family.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.285
Lastly, a minor type,
about three to 5% are.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:37.565
Coding decoding based series in these,
the series might follow a specific

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:41.975
coding decoding rule that you, my
smart friend will need to decipher.

00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:47.645
It's like being a secret agent, but with
a pen and paper formulas and tricks.

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.905
All right, let's talk about some
nifty formulas and tricks that

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.795
will make your life much easier.

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.315
First alphabetical positions.

00:03:56.674 --> 00:04:00.394
It's super important to know these
by heart, like your own name.

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:04.805
We have forward positions
A equals one B equals two.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:10.204
All the way to Zed equals 26, and
equally important are reverse positions.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:15.035
Zed equals one y equals
two down to a equals 26.

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:19.765
For quick forward referencing,
remember our good friend EJOT.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:27.385
That's e equals five J equals 10 O
equals 15 T equals 20 y equals 25.

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:31.765
It's like a five star hotel for
your brain and for quick reverse

00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:34.705
referencing, think V-Q-L-G-F.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.805
That's v equals five.

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:42.595
Q equals 10 L equals 15
G equals 20 F equals 25.

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:44.215
When counted from the reverse.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.490
Practice these.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.580
They're game changers
for pattern recognition.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.219
Always be on the lookout for numbers.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.740
Check for common differences or ratios.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.550
Are they squares, cubes,
prime numbers, or perhaps an

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.770
alternating pattern for letters.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.270
Check for skipped letters.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.460
Simple alphabetical, order forward or
reverse, or even vowel consonant patterns.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.950
They love to play hide
and seek with these.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.340
And for pair identification, especially
when asked about pairs of letters with

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.570
as many letters between them, as in
the English alphabet, the trick is to

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.060
systematically check all possible pairs.

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:24.599
Don't rush, be methodical,
like a good tailor.

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:26.250
Methods of solving.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.955
Now how do we actually
tackle these problems?

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.130
Let's talk about the methods.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.160
First up, direct observation and counting.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.900
Simple yet effective.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.450
Read the given series super carefully.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.210
Identify the specific elements involved.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.700
Are they letters, numbers, or symbols?

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.480
For position based questions,
you've got to count accurately

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.565
from the specified end.

00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:53.724
Be it left or right, and for questions
involving between, remember to

00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:58.555
count only those elements that fall
exclusively between the two given points.

00:05:58.914 --> 00:06:02.844
Don't count the end points themselves,
just the ones chilling in the middle.

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:07.794
Next we have pattern identification,
which is crucial for finding missing

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:10.375
terms or the odd one out for numbers.

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:13.974
Calculate the differences
between consecutive terms if

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.385
the differences are constant.

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:16.315
Congratulations.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.830
You found an arithmetic progression.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.580
If the differences form a
pattern themselves, like squares,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.510
cubes, or an increasing or
decreasing series, identify that.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.200
Also, always keep an eye
out for multiplication or

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.270
division patterns for letters.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.970
Note the position of each
letter in the alphabet.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.150
Check the difference in positions
between consecutive letters.

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:45.165
C, if letters are being skipped,
for example, ACO CCO e clearly

00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:46.665
implies skipping one letter.

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:51.405
Observe if the pattern involves
vowels, consonance, or maybe a reverse

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:53.594
alphabetical order for symbols.

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.375
Look for repetition, alternation
with other elements or a very

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.055
specific sequence of symbols.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.090
And for Mix series, the best approach
is to analyze each type of element

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.100
letter number symbol separately
for its pattern within the series.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.600
Or sometimes they form neat
little groups like a one hash.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.719
B, $2 C 3%, and you need
to spot that group pattern.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.650
Then there's a rearrangement
transformation analysis.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.760
If the question asks you to
rearrange the series, for instance,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.410
if all numbers are dropped.

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:34.425
Then you mentally, or by quickly
jotting it down, need to create that

00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:39.435
new series first and then apply your
counting or pattern identification

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.225
methods to this new transformed series.

00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:46.005
It's like giving the series a
makeover before you judge it.

00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:48.315
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:50.915
Time for some smart
techniques, my friends.

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:53.165
First, visualize the series.

00:07:53.525 --> 00:07:59.105
Don't just read it mentally, picture it,
or quickly jot down a simplified version.

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.955
Your brain works wonders with visual aids.

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:04.205
Next, divide and conquer.

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:08.765
For those really long or complex
series, don't get intimidated.

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:11.915
Break it down into
smaller, manageable chunks.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.060
Or analyze the patterns of letters,
numbers, and symbols independently.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.450
It's like eating an
elephant one bite at a time.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.859
Count carefully.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.960
This cannot be stressed enough.

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:27.530
When you are asked to count
elements from an end or between

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.870
elements, be absolutely precise.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.684
Mark the elements as you count
to avoid those pesky errors.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.970
A small mistake here can cost you marks.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.340
Remember, direction matters.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.450
Always pay super close attention
to whether you need to count from

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.280
the left end or the right end.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.270
Left typically means the beginning
of the series as you read it,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.520
and right means the very end.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.910
Don't mix them up or you'll
be counting backwards.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.565
And as I mentioned before.

00:08:57.074 --> 00:08:58.935
Learn alphabetical positions.

00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.775
Knowing the forward and backward
positions of letters, perhaps

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:07.334
using our EJ OT trick, drastically
speeds up letter based questions.

00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:09.255
It's like having a superpower.

00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:12.495
Also, always consider option elimination.

00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:16.724
Sometimes even if you can't fully
solve the problem in your head, a

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:20.865
quick observation of the pattern or
the nature of the question can help

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:22.755
you eliminate incorrect options.

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:27.625
It narrows down your choices, making
your educated guests much more powerful,

00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:30.325
and finally, practice with timers.

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:34.195
Regular practice under timed
conditions is your secret source.

00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:38.335
It helps improve both speed
and accuracy, making pattern

00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:40.495
recognition almost instinctive.

00:09:40.825 --> 00:09:43.315
You'll be spotting patterns
faster than a hawk.

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:46.915
Spotting it, spray common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:47.860
All right.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.950
Let's talk about the potholes
on this road, the common

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.660
mistakes we need to avoid.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.540
The number one culprit is counting errors.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.230
This is the most frequent
mistake, especially when asked

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.820
for elements between, remember
exclusive counting or when the

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.160
series itself is long and winding.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.670
Be meticulous.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.800
Then there's directional confusion mixing
up left to right and right to left.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.180
Counting is a classic or failing to
switch directions when the question

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.709
specifically demands it like fourth to
the right of the fifth from the left.

00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:24.055
Pay attention to those
prepositions my friend.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.280
Another one is ignoring element types.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.630
Sometimes friends overlook symbols
or specific types of elements,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.030
like just letters or just numbers.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.650
When the question actually applies to
all of them, read the question fully.

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:43.900
Don't skim, and please don't fall into
the trap of assuming simple patterns,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:48.670
never Just verify the identified pattern
for the first two or three terms.

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:51.939
You must verify it
across the entire series.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.480
Sometimes patterns can change
or they can be much more complex

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.950
than you initially perceived.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.810
They love to trick you like that.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.880
Also, a common misinterpretation is
for immediately proceeded or followed.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.890
Forgetting that immediately means
directly next to without any other element

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.930
in between can throw off your count.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.520
No spacing in between.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.180
Understood.

00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:19.675
And finally, a simple yet powerful
tip, not rereading the question after

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:23.334
you think you've solved it quickly
reread the question one last time.

00:11:23.454 --> 00:11:27.355
To ensure your answer directly
addresses exactly what was asked.

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:30.355
A quick check can save
you from a silly mistake.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.305
W Edge framework summary.

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:37.285
Let's quickly summarize this whole concept
using our trusty WH framework, shall we?

00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:39.954
So what is alphabetical series?

00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:43.949
It's a sequence composed of
letters, numbers, and symbols

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.689
arranged in a logical manner.

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.310
And why do we learn it?

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:52.079
It's essential for assessing logical
reasoning, observation skills, and

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.760
of course, pattern recognition.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.930
Very important.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.550
When is it applied?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.600
It's applied in competitive
exam reasoning sections to solve

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.220
sequential pattern problems.

00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:04.295
Where can you find these questions?

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:08.584
They're commonly found in various
government and banking entrance exams.

00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:10.235
Who needs to study this?

00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:14.615
Well, you, my friend, and all
candidates appearing for competitive

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:18.515
exams, particularly in the banking
and civil services sectors.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.975
And finally, how do we solve them?

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:24.755
By identifying the underlying
rule of arrangement, counting

00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:29.194
positions or recognizing numerical
or alphabetical progressions.

00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.334
Simple, isn't it?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.850
Fully worked out examples.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.770
Now for the fun part, let's look
at some fully worked out examples.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.130
This is where the rubber
meets the road as they say.

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:44.865
Example, one question.

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:49.814
Study the following arrangement carefully
and answer the questions given below.

00:12:50.355 --> 00:13:07.780
R four TJ two at the rate MD six P, a
8% KL nine E, dollar Q3 HI seven UN five

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.734
W. How many such numbers are there in
the given arrangement, each of which

00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:18.505
is immediately proceeded by a letter
and immediately followed by a symbol?

00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:24.655
Options A one B2C 3D four.

00:13:25.194 --> 00:13:27.870
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:31.245
Solution, step one.

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:34.995
First things first, my friend,
understand the condition clearly.

00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:38.895
We need to find sequences that
perfectly fit the pattern.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:43.785
Letter number symbol, no
compromises, no exceptions.

00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:48.855
Step two, now scan the given
arrangement with a hawk's eye and

00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:51.030
locate all the numbers we have.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.839
4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 3, 7, 5. Keep them in mind.

00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:00.719
Step three, time for the real work.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:06.479
Let's check each number in the series for
our letter number symbol pattern four.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:06.930
Four.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.890
We see.

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:10.945
R Letter four, T letter.

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:13.315
Hmm, doesn't fit our criteria.

00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:16.765
T is a letter, not a symbol for two.

00:14:17.095 --> 00:14:17.665
Aha.

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:20.035
We have J. Letter two.

00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:21.535
Add the rate symbol.

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:22.375
Bingo.

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:23.935
This fits perfectly.

00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:27.265
J two add is a first find for six.

00:14:27.505 --> 00:14:31.315
Next is hash symbol six P letter.

00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:34.795
Nope, it's proceeded by
a symbol, not a letter.

00:14:35.005 --> 00:14:35.665
Doesn't fit.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:36.730
Four, eight.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.770
Look here a letter.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.720
8% symbol.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.610
Yes, this fits too.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.120
A 8% is a second find four, nine.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.980
We have a letter.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.780
Nine, E letter.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.150
Another Miss E is a letter.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.340
Four, three Q letter.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.940
Three.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.140
H letter.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.250
Sadly, another Miss H
is a letter four, seven.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.420
And here we go.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.360
I letter seven star symbol.

00:15:04.555 --> 00:15:05.545
Fantastic.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:10.255
This fits a pattern I seven
at is a third find four, five.

00:15:10.495 --> 00:15:14.064
Finally, end letter five W. Nope.

00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:16.285
W is a letter doesn't fit.

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:17.425
Step four.

00:15:17.694 --> 00:15:21.175
Now let's count the sequences
that proudly fit a pattern.

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:23.079
We found three such numbers.

00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:29.965
Two in J two at eight in a
8%, and seven in I seven star.

00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:34.015
So the correct answer my friend is C3.

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:34.944
Well done.

00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:37.824
Example two question.

00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:42.715
If all the symbols are dropped
from the above arrangement, which

00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:46.405
of the following will be the
12th element from the right end?

00:15:47.064 --> 00:15:48.285
R. Four.

00:15:49.425 --> 00:16:09.420
TJ two add the rate MD six PA 8% KL nine
E dollar Q3 HI seven UN five W options.

00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:13.905
A K, BLC nine.

00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:20.565
D. E. Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:25.215
Step one first, understand
the instruction carefully.

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:31.005
The question wants us to first remove all
symbols from the original arrangement.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.555
This is a transformation step.

00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:40.510
Remember, original series
R four TJ two at the rate.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:58.135
MD six PA 8% KL nine E, dollar Q3
HI seven star UN five W, step two.

00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:03.325
Now let's create our new series by
playing Hide and seek With all the

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:09.775
symbols, add the rate hash percent,
dollar star, we'll eliminate them.

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:11.115
New series.

00:17:11.565 --> 00:17:25.244
R four D, J two M, D six P, a
eight K, L nine EQ three HI seven

00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:29.805
UN five W. See much cleaner.

00:17:30.225 --> 00:17:31.095
Step three.

00:17:31.455 --> 00:17:35.805
Next, identify the right end
of this newly formed series.

00:17:36.254 --> 00:17:41.685
Looking at it, the right most element
is clearly W. That's our starting

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:44.264
point for counting step four.

00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:47.985
Now the task is to count the 12th element.

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:54.225
We start from the right end W and move
towards the left in our new symbol.

00:17:54.225 --> 00:17:59.655
Free series, first element
W, second element five.

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:06.975
Third element N, fourth element U,
fifth element seven, sixth element I,

00:18:07.095 --> 00:18:10.455
seventh element H, eighth element three.

00:18:10.605 --> 00:18:13.125
Ninth element Q, 10th Element.

00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:18.645
E. 11th element nine, 12th
Element L. There you have it.

00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:24.825
The 12th element from the right end in
our modified series is L. Step five.

00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:29.025
The correct answer is BL. Simple as that.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.550
When you follow the steps, example three.

00:18:32.495 --> 00:18:36.935
Question, what should come in the
place of question mark in the following

00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:39.635
series based on the above arrangement?

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:50.255
Four J, D six, eight K question mark
N five R four TJ two at the rate MD

00:18:50.945 --> 00:19:03.800
six P. A 8% KL nine E, dollar Q3 HI
seven, star U and five W options.

00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:09.889
A-E-Q-B-Q three C nine QDE three.

00:19:10.429 --> 00:19:13.250
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:19:14.064 --> 00:19:16.135
Solution, step one.

00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:18.534
Let's dissect the pattern, my friend.

00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:22.855
We need to analyze the pattern
for the first elements of each

00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:24.445
pair in the given sequence.

00:19:24.564 --> 00:19:30.205
That's four D eight question
mark N relative to their original

00:19:30.205 --> 00:19:32.245
positions in the main arrangement.

00:19:32.775 --> 00:19:37.095
Let's jot down the positions
one based index of these first

00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:38.805
elements from the main series.

00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:43.575
Four is at position two,
D is at position eight.

00:19:43.935 --> 00:19:46.125
Now what's the jump from four to D?

00:19:46.515 --> 00:19:49.575
That's eight minus two,
which is six positions.

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:50.265
Got it.

00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:51.165
Eight.

00:19:51.345 --> 00:19:52.185
Is that position?

00:19:52.335 --> 00:19:54.975
13? What's the jump from D to eight?

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:58.605
That's 13 minus eight,
which is five positions.

00:19:59.095 --> 00:19:59.905
Step two.

00:20:00.264 --> 00:20:00.835
All right.

00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:05.004
Now observe the pattern of these
jumps between the first elements.

00:20:05.395 --> 00:20:08.754
We had a jump of six, then a jump of five.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:09.385
See it.

00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:14.365
The jumps are decreasing by one
following this delightful pattern.

00:20:14.544 --> 00:20:17.095
The next jump should be four positions.

00:20:17.514 --> 00:20:22.375
So the position of the first element
of our missing pair will be 13.

00:20:22.675 --> 00:20:25.225
Current position of eight plus four.

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:26.935
That makes it 17.

00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:31.325
Now looking at the main series,
which element is happily

00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:33.245
sitting at the 17th position?

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:34.625
It's nine.

00:20:35.014 --> 00:20:38.705
Therefore, we've nailed the first
element of the missing pair.

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:41.105
It's nine step three.

00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:46.024
Now for the second element of the pair,
since we firmly established that the

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:52.115
first element is nine, let's speak at
the options option C nine Q is the.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.070
Only one that starts with nine.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.170
That's a huge hint, isn't it?

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.760
But let's verify how Q relates
to nine in the main series.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.960
Just to be sure.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.850
In our main series, around
nine L nine E dollar.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.600
Q3 H and so on.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.070
Nine is at position 17,
Q is at position 20.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.700
Between nine and Q, we have E and dollar.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.690
This means Q is the third
element to the right of nine.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.690
We are skipping two
elements, E and dollar.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:29.820
Now you might notice that the
previous pairs four JD six,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.900
eight K showed the second element
being two positions to the right.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.250
Skipping one element.

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:40.274
But my friend in competitive
exams, sometimes these patterns can

00:21:40.274 --> 00:21:44.475
cleverly shift or apply specifically
to a certain part of the series.

00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:48.794
Given that nine is strongly
established as the first element

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:53.715
and nine Q is a clear option, this
indicates the intended internal

00:21:53.715 --> 00:21:56.054
relationship for this specific pair.

00:21:56.205 --> 00:22:02.834
So we trust our deduction and the option
given step four, combine our deduced first

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:05.294
element and the verified second element.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.419
The missing pair is indeed nine Q.
Correct answer is C nine Q and that

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:13.820
my friend, is how you decode these.

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:14.810
Thank you.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.490
See you in the next lecture.
