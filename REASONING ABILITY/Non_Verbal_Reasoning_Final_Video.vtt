00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on nonverbal reasoning.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.710
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.040
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.580
So what is this nonverbal
reasoning you ask?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.950
It's like being a detective, but instead
of clues in words, you get pictures.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.110
It is a branch of reasoning that
involves understanding and interpreting

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.030
information presented in the form
of figures, diagrams, patterns, and

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.820
images rather than words or numbers.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
It tests your ability
to analyze visual data.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:42.355
Identify relationships, recognize
patterns, and solve problems without

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:45.295
relying on linguistic or numerical skills.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:49.915
This section assesses your spatial
reasoning, logical deduction,

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:53.875
and analytical abilities
through purely visual means.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:59.745
Real world relevance and don't
think this is just for your exam.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:00.675
Oh, no.

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:06.495
Nonverbal reasoning skills are crucial
because they enhance the ability to

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:12.525
quickly grasp complex visual data and
identify underlying patterns in financial

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:14.985
reports or operational diagrams.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:20.085
These skills are vital for accurate
decision making and efficient problem

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.634
solving in a fast-paced environment.

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:28.545
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns in past papers.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.685
Some question types are more popular
than your favorite movie star.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:37.335
First, we have figure series
completion, identifying the next

00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:42.975
figure in a given sequence, and this
makes up about 25 to 30% of questions.

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:48.705
Then there's figure analogy, finding a
similar relationship between two pairs

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.825
of figures, which is roughly 15 to 20%.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.950
Next is figure classification or the
classic odd one out where you identify the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.350
figure that does not belong to a group.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.780
Also, around 15 to 20%.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.820
We also have embedded figures, which
is like locating a hidden figure

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.610
within a complex design, making up
about 10 to 15%, and who can forget?

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:19.205
Paper folding and cutting, where you must
visualize the unfolded pattern of a folded

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:22.535
and cut paper, also around 10 to 15%.

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:27.155
Finally, there's mirror and water
images determining the reflection

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:32.135
of a figure in a mirror or water,
which comes in at about five to 10%.

00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:34.995
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:40.245
Now, forget complicated mathematical
formulas, my friend in this game.

00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:45.285
Your best tools are keen observation
and a logical mind, but here

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:46.755
are some key tricks for you.

00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:52.545
First, always observe if figures are
undergoing rotation, either clockwise or

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:55.305
anti-clockwise, and by how many degrees.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.350
Maybe 45, 90, or 180.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.760
Next, track the movement of
individual elements within a figure,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.140
like an arrow moving, one step
or a dot, shifting its position.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.090
Also be a detective and identify
if elements are being added,

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.280
removed, or changing in number.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:16.445
Which is the addition removal trick.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:20.825
Notice changes in shading or
pattern change like crosshatching

00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.234
or internal patterns.

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:27.095
Look for alterations in the size or
shape of figures or their components,

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.405
which we call a size, shape change.

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:34.055
And finally, always check for symmetry
or the lack of it in the figures.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.929
Methods of solving.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.840
So how do we tackle
these different beasts?

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.530
Here are some general methods
for series completion.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.190
You must analyze the progression
from one figure to the next.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.614
Look for consistent changes in position,
orientation, size, or number of elements.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.890
Once you identify the rule
governing the sequence, apply

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.359
it to find the missing figure.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.489
For analogy, your job is to determine
the exact relationship between the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.269
first pair of figures like rotation,
inversion, or a component change.

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:12.165
Then you apply that same
relationship to the third figure.

00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:17.445
To find the fourth for classification,
you must examine all the given figures

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:21.464
to find a common characteristic
or pattern shared by most of them.

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:25.844
The figure that does not share this
characteristic is the odd one out.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.760
For embedded figures, you have to
mentally rotate or manipulate the given

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.650
simple figure to see if it fits exactly
into any part of the complex figure.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.000
Focus on its distinct features
for paper folding and cutting.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.789
Imagine the paper being
folded step by step.

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.979
Then visualize the cuts.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.200
Finally, mentally unfold the paper layer
by layer, mirroring the cuts at each

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.479
fold line to find the final pattern.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.920
For mirror and water images,
the method is simple.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.500
For mirror images, imagine a vertical line
and reverse the figure horizontally for

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.450
water images, imagine a horizontal line
and reverse the figure vertically with

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.000
the top becoming bottom and vice versa.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.640
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to solve these even faster.

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:15.780
Of course you do.

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.179
So here are some smart techniques.

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.190
Use elimination to quickly get rid
of options that are clearly incorrect

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.659
based on a single obvious difference.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.250
If a figure has many elements focus
on one element at a time, like

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.480
only the arrow, then only the.to
simplify finding the pattern.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.039
Sometimes the pattern is just about
an increasing or decreasing number

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.110
of things, so count elements.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.570
Pay attention to elements at the edge.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.560
Cases like corners, as their
movement often reveals the pattern.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.969
A quick symmetry check can be a
lifesaver for mirror or water images.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.300
If a figure is symmetrical
along the axis of reflection,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.219
its image will be identical.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.750
And most importantly, my friend,
you must practice visualization

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.950
regularly, practice mentally rotating,
folding, and manipulating figures

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.349
to improve your spatial reasoning.

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:08.830
Speed.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.540
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.350
Now, let's talk about the
common traps people fall into.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.880
Don't be that person.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.340
A big one is overlooking subtle changes
like missing small changes in shading

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.920
line thickness or the order of elements.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.470
Another is incorrect rotation, mixing
up clockwise with anti-clockwise or

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.450
misjudging the degree of rotation.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.740
Some people make the mistake of ignoring
all elements, focusing on only one part

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.030
of a complex figure when the pattern
involves multiple interacting parts.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.080
A classic blunder is mirror
versus water image confusion.

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.039
Don't apply horizontal reflection
for water images or vertical

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.450
reflection for mirror images.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.320
Also don't be fooled by
assuming simple patterns.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.360
Sometimes the logic can be multi-layered
or involve two simultaneous changes.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.950
And please avoid rushing paper,
folding, not visualizing each fold

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.425
and cut step by step will definitely
lead to errors in unfolding.

00:07:10.935 --> 00:07:12.735
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:16.785
So to quickly summarize
everything in a neat package,

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:18.975
let's use the W Edge framework.

00:07:19.365 --> 00:07:20.055
What is it?

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:25.905
Nonverbal reasoning is simply problem
solving using visual patterns and figures.

00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:27.375
Why do we learn it?

00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:32.775
It assesses your logical, analytical
and spatial reasoning skills, which

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:34.365
are crucial for problem solving.

00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:36.265
When is it applied?

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:41.515
You'll find it in competitive exams,
cognitive assessments, and any job

00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:43.765
requiring visual data analysis.

00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:46.705
Where is it used in the real world?

00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:50.725
It's used in operations for
data visualization, security

00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:53.395
analysis, and process optimization.

00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:54.835
Who is this for?

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.545
Any friend like you.

00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:01.465
Job aspirants, professionals in
analytical roles and anyone who needs

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:03.565
to interpret visual information.

00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:06.235
And finally, how do we master it?

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:11.365
By observing changes, identifying
patterns, applying logical rules,

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:15.595
and visualizing transformations
of figures fully worked out.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.405
Examples.

00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:18.475
All right, enough theory.

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:21.110
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:26.295
Example, one figure series
completion question, which

00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:28.155
figure will complete the series?

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:31.575
Problem figures are a
square with a small circle.

00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:36.315
Moving from top left to top, right
to bottom, right to bottom left.

00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:38.025
Here are your options.

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:43.605
A a square with a small circle in
the top left corner, BA square with a

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.465
small circle in the top right corner.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.670
CA square with a small circle
in the bottom right corner.

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:55.219
DA square with a small circle in the top
left corner, but the circle is shaded.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.699
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.170
Let's solve this.

00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:02.930
Step one, we analyze the pattern.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.665
We observe the movement of the
small circle inside the square.

00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:10.175
In figure one, it's top left in two.

00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:15.395
Top right in three, bottom right,
and in four, it's at the bottom left.

00:09:15.724 --> 00:09:17.974
Step two, identify the rule.

00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:20.015
It's quite clear, isn't it?

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:24.364
The small circle is moving clockwise
from one corner to the next.

00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:27.219
It's making a full tour
of the square corners.

00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:31.225
Step three, apply the rule
to find the next figure.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:35.485
After the bottom left corner in
figure four, the next clockwise

00:09:35.485 --> 00:09:37.885
stop is back to the top left corner.

00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:40.584
Step four, compare with options.

00:09:40.944 --> 00:09:43.074
Option A shows exactly that.

00:09:43.464 --> 00:09:48.295
Option D tries to trick us with a
shaded circle, a new element, not

00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:50.125
part of our established pattern.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:55.495
So the correct answer is a
example two figure analogy.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.580
Question, select the figure from the
options that has the same relationship

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.860
with the third figure as the first two
figures have, the problem is a large

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.560
circle with a small square inside is two,
a large square with a small circle inside.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.970
So a large triangle with a
small star inside is two.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.440
What options?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.710
A, a large star with a
small triangle inside.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:25.520
B, a large triangle with a
small star inside, but inverted.

00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:31.400
C, a large circle with a star inside
D, a large star with a circle inside.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.819
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:36.410
Let's break it down.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.109
Step one, analyze the relationship.

00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:44.870
In the first pair, a large circle with
a small square inside transforms into a

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.270
large square with a small circle inside.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.640
The outer shape becomes the
inner shape, and the inner

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.290
shape becomes the outer shape.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.300
They just swapped places.

00:10:54.569 --> 00:10:58.380
Step two, apply the same
relationship to the third figure.

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:03.090
The third figure is a large
triangle with a small star inside.

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:08.220
Following our rule, the outer triangle
should go inside and the inner star

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.050
should become the big outer shape.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.360
So the resulting figure should be a
large star with a small triangle inside.

00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:18.145
Step three, compare with options.

00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:22.975
Option A shows a large star with
a small triangle inside, which

00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:25.135
perfectly matches our derived figure.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:30.055
The correct answer is a
example, three embedded figures.

00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:30.985
Question.

00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:34.735
Find out which of the answer
figures contains the problem

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:36.895
figure, which is a simple Z shape.

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:38.635
Answer figures are.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.640
A, a complex geometric pattern
with many lines, but no clear zed.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.770
B, a pattern resembling a staircase
where a Zed shape can be traced.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:55.310
C, a figure made of curved lines with
no zed DA grid of squares with no Zed.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.760
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.990
Let's hunt for the Zed.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.420
Step one, understand the
problem, figure the problem.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.610
Figure X is a simple Zed shape.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.870
We need to find this exact Zed
shape embedded within one of

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.430
the complex answer figures.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.470
The Zed can be rotated.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.260
Step two, we examine each answer.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.850
Figure carefully, figure a. No
clear Zed shape can be identified.

00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:25.495
Figure B, look closely
at the staircase pattern.

00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:30.925
You can identify a Z shape formed by
a horizontal line, a diagonal line,

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:36.355
and another horizontal line figure C.
This figure consists of only curved

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.725
lines, so a Zed cannot be present.

00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:44.125
Figure D. This is a grid of squares,
so an isolated Zed shape is not there.

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:46.975
Step three, confirm the embedded figure.

00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:51.485
The Zed shape is clearly visible
within figure B. Correct answer.

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:53.045
B. Thank you.

00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:54.550
See you in the next lecture.
