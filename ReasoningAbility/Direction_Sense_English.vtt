00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on direction.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.240
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.000
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.630
All right, friends, so what
is direction sense all about?

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.610
It's like your internal GPS, you
know, it's a fundamental reasoning

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.045
topic that tests your amazing ability.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.070
To understand and figure out where things
or people are based on how they move.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.170
Think of it as knowing your left from
your right, even after a long day.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
This topic mainly involves knowing
your basic directions, the fancy

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.555
cardinal directions, and of course
distances Now for the basic directions.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:52.005
We have the big four, north N,
south S, and East E and West W.

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:53.025
Simple, right?

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:54.975
But here's a little trick.

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:58.695
If you are facing north, then
east is always to your right

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:00.915
side and west is to your left.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.275
And yes, south is busy
chilling behind you.

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:09.465
Conversely, if you decide to face
South, then West magically appears to

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.865
your right and east is to your left.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:12.795
And North.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.745
Well, it's behind you then.

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:15.585
Makes sense.

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:15.855
No.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.405
Next up the cardinal directions.

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:22.905
These are like the cool intermediate
stops between the main directions.

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:28.995
We have Northeast and E, which is
naturally between north and east.

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:33.890
Then there's Northwest and W
nestled between North and West.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.330
For the southern side, we have southeast
SE chilling between south and east,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.479
and finally southwest sw comfortably
positioned between south and west.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.479
It's like a compass, but for your brain.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.460
Let's talk about turning.

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:55.955
This is where most friends get confused,
but it's simpler than you think.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240
For left right turns unless
they specify something else.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.430
A turn where the left or right
always means a crisp, 90 degree turn.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
For instance, if you are facing north
and you take a right turn, you'll be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.020
facing east ready to catch some sunrise.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.550
If you turn left, you'll be facing
west, heading towards the sunset.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.750
Easy peasy.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.730
Then we have clockwise or
anti-clockwise or counterclockwise

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.290
for our international friends.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.420
These terms are all about
rotational movement.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
Like a Bollywood dance move
Clockwise is when you move in the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.360
same direction as the hands of your
old wall clock and anti-clockwise.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.710
That's when you go in the exact
opposite direction of those clock hands.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.030
Sometimes turns are given
in degrees like 45 degrees.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.790
1 35 degrees or a full 180 degrees.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.820
A 180 degree turn is super important.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.030
It means you've completely
reversed your direction.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.579
It's like doing an about turn in the
army parade and finally, distance.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.070
This part is crucial for your marks.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.510
Total distance is just the sum of
all the segments you've traveled.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:13.665
Like adding up all the kilometers on
your morning walk, but the shortest

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:18.495
distance, also known as displacement, is
the straight line distance directly from

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:20.715
your starting point to your ending point.

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:25.185
Think of it as taking the express
highway instead of the scenic route.

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:29.475
This often forms the hypotonus
of a right angle triangle, so

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.215
brush up your geometry friends.

00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:33.435
Then there are relative directions.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:38.265
This is about figuring out the direction
of one point in relation to another point.

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:43.025
For example, when they say point
B is to the northeast of point

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:47.285
A, you are essentially standing
at A and pointing towards B.

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:50.285
It's like giving directions
to a lost tourist.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.145
Real world relevance.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.525
Now, why is understanding direction
sense so important for an officer?

00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:00.425
Well, it's not just about finding your
way to the coffee machine friends.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.490
It's crucial because it
sharpens your analytical skills.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.900
These are vital for interpreting
complex financial information and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.060
making those precise big decisions.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.190
In a bank, it boosts your ability to
follow instructions with accuracy and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.230
quickly assess facial relationships,
which is absolutely critical for managing

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.540
data and operations within a bank.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.630
Think about it, you'll be navigating
complex data structures like finding

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.580
your way through a maze of spreadsheets.

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.870
You'll need to understand workflow
diagrams and processes, much

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.340
like following a treasure map.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.870
You'll be solving logical problems
with spatial elements, making sure

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.700
everything fits just right, plus
interpreting instructions for physical

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.344
asset management, knowing where the
files are, where the money vaults.

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:50.665
You get the drill.

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:55.375
And of course, assessing geographical
information related to branches

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:59.215
or customers, perhaps for market
expansion or fraud detection.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:02.905
All this helps in developing
strong visualization and

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:04.255
mental mapping abilities.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:10.255
So it's not just a topic, it's a life
skill breakdown of question types.

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:15.425
Based on past patterns in your exam,
here are the common question types

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:18.034
you'll encounter for the direction topic.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:24.965
Firstly, basic direction and distance
questions, making up a whopping 50 to 60%.

00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:30.544
These questions usually ask for your final
direction from the starting point or the

00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:35.705
total distance covered, or that crucial
shortest distance between start and end.

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:39.719
They love to make you walk around
a lot with multiple movements.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.280
Then we have relative direction
questions about 20 to 25%.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.039
Here you need to figure out the direction
of one point or person compared to another

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.469
after a whole lot of moving around.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.099
Shadow based problems are about 10 to 15%.

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:01.539
These are the tricky ones involving
the position of a shadow during

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.950
sunrise or sunset, you need to
understand where the sun is playing,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.169
hide and seek relative to directions.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.230
Angular movement questions
are rarer five to 10%.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.150
These involve turns specified in degrees
like 45, 91 35, or even 180 degrees,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.700
either clockwise or anti-clockwise.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.650
No more just left or right.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.510
Now it's about precision.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.080
And occasionally you might find
coded directions around zero to 5%.

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:38.560
This is where symbols represent directions
like A at B, meaning A is north of B.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.299
You have to be a codebreaker to
solve these formulas and tricks.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.960
Now, for the juicy part,
the formulas and tricks.

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:49.865
First up, the Mighty Pythagoreous theorem.

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:54.635
Remember this golden rule for calculating
the shortest distance are famous

00:06:54.635 --> 00:07:00.275
hypotenuse in a right angle triangle,
A square plus B square equals C square

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:05.885
Here C is the hypotenuse, and A and B
are your other two perpendicular sides.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:06.515
Don't leave home without it.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.580
For directional turns, a right turn always
means a 90 degree clockwise movement.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.780
A left turn always means a 90
degree anti-clockwise movement.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.810
Simple and sweet for cardinal directions.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.539
Visualization, always I repeat.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.310
Always imagine a cross in your mind
like the plus sign representing

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.590
North, south, east, west.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.500
And remember, north is always up.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.400
Unless gravity suddenly decides to
change its mind, which it won't.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.030
Opposite directions are also key.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.950
North is directly opposite to south
and east is directly opposite to West.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.200
They're like rival teams always facing
off, and for those notorious suns

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.810
position questions at sunrise, the sun
is always in the east, which means your

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.150
shadow naturally falls to the west.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.430
At sunset, the sun is in the west,
so your shadow will fall to the east.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.350
Remember this, it's a lifesaver.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.510
Methods of solving, how do
we tackle these direction?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.010
Sense problems you ask?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.349
Well, friends, we have a few
excellent methods, the most

00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:19.780
effective and widely used method.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.650
The Evergreen champion
is drawing a diagram.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:28.120
Seriously, a picture is worth
a thousand calculations here.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.280
Start by marking your initial position.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.049
Let's call it home base.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:38.330
Then draw lines for each movement
segment, making sure to show both

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.370
the direction and the distance.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.990
Use little arrows to proudly
display the direction of movement.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.920
Clearly mark every single turn, whether
it's a left or a right, and don't forget

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.020
to label the distances for each segment
like you're creating your own little map.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:03.170
Finally, identify your start and end
points and determine whatever the question

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.050
is asking, be it direction or distance.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.495
This method rarely lets you down.

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:13.365
Another smart approach is using
a coordinate system, either

00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:15.495
mentally or with a quick sketch.

00:09:15.944 --> 00:09:20.655
Just assign your starting point
as zero zero, like the origin on

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:25.814
a graph movements to the east will
increase your X coordinate because

00:09:25.935 --> 00:09:27.704
you are moving right on the graph.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.420
Movements to the west will
decrease your X coordinate.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.189
Moving left movements to the north
will increase your Y coordinate.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:40.870
Going up and movements to the south
will decrease your Y coordinate.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:46.750
Going down your final coordinates
XY will then effortlessly help you

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.430
determine both your final position
and the shortest distance from zero

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.980
zero using our good old OUS theorem.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.015
Then there's tracking net displacement.

00:09:58.344 --> 00:10:02.454
This is for the more advanced
friends, very efficient for

00:10:02.454 --> 00:10:04.735
movements along the north south axis.

00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:08.935
Just sum up all your northward
movements as positive and all

00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:10.555
southward movements as negative.

00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:14.155
The result is your net NS displacement.

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:19.495
Similarly, for movements along the
EastWest axis sum up all eastward

00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:23.395
movements as positive and all
westward movements as negative.

00:10:23.785 --> 00:10:26.305
This gives you your net EW displacement.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:31.860
These two net displacement north,
south, and east west will conveniently

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.480
form the two perpendicular sides of a
right angle triangle, allowing you to

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.699
quickly calculate the shortest distance.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.020
Isn't that clever?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.350
Then there's shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.580
Time for some jugar are
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.370
The net movement principle is golden.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.300
Instead of tracking every single
turn like a hawk, just focus on the

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.640
overall net effect of your movements.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.350
For example, if someone walks
five meters north, then decides to

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.580
walk three meters south, the net
movement is simply two meters north.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.530
Why complicate things right?

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:13.925
Visualize turns quickly when a
person makes multiple turns, mentally

00:11:13.925 --> 00:11:18.665
track their final facing direction
rather than drawing the entire path,

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:23.015
especially if the question only asks
for the direction from the start.

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:28.205
For instance, if someone goes north,
then right then, right again, then

00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:30.335
left, they'll end up facing East.

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:34.655
Practice this in your head,
Python or triplet recognition.

00:11:34.805 --> 00:11:35.975
This is a pro tip.

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:45.335
Memorize common Ian Triplets like 3,
4, 5, 5, 12, 13, 8, 15, 17 or 7 24 25.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:49.565
Knowing these by heart will let
you calculate shortest distances

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:54.070
in a blink without wasting precious
exam time on lengthy calculations.

00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:56.595
You'll be a maths magician.

00:11:57.015 --> 00:12:02.325
Elimination based on First step, sometimes
the very first or second movement

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:04.815
drastically changes the overall direction.

00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:09.855
Use this to your advantage to quickly
eliminate options that don't make sense.

00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:13.485
It's like playing guess the
direction, but with an edge

00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:15.735
for relative position mapping.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:21.405
If a question asks for the direction of
point B with respect to point A, always.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:27.435
Always, always imagine you are standing
right at point A and looking towards point

00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:33.525
B. This mental trick makes it crystal
clear, common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:38.084
All right, friends, let's talk
about the pitfalls, the booby traps.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.829
The common mistakes, we must
avoid the number one culprit,

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:45.140
confusing left and right turns.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.600
This is the most frequent error.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.300
Trust me, always I repeat.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:54.650
Always imagine yourself standing
there facing the specified

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.840
direction and then making that turn.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.194
Don't confuse your left
right with the characters.

00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:04.625
Next up incorrect application
of Pythagoras Theorem.

00:13:05.015 --> 00:13:09.275
Some friends apply it to calculate
total distance instead of shortest

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:13.685
distance, or they incorrectly
identify the perpendicular sides.

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:18.305
Remember, it's for shortest distance
in a right angle triangle only

00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:20.944
then ignoring starting point.

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.525
This is a classic misinterpretation.

00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:28.625
Always reread the question carefully,
especially when it asks for the direction.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.850
From the starting point or from the
ending point, the perspective matters.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.730
Misinterpreting cardinal directions
confusing northeast with just north or

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.130
just east, or sketching those intermediate
directions incorrectly on your diagram.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.710
A small error here can snowball,
and of course, simple calculation

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.510
errors, basic arithmetic mistakes
when summing distances or when

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.730
calculating squares and square roots.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.150
Double check your numbers.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.219
Friends, your marks depend on it.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.810
Not accounting.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.579
For 180 degree turn, a 180 degree
turn simply means you are now

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.829
facing the exact opposite direction.

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:11.270
Don't overthink it.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.770
Just do a U-turn.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.089
And finally.

00:14:14.155 --> 00:14:15.265
Shadow location.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:17.515
This one always trips up a few.

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:18.925
Don't forget this.

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:19.704
Golden rule.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:23.725
Morning shadows are always in
the west and evening shadows

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:25.855
are always in the east period.

00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:27.055
No exceptions.

00:14:27.564 --> 00:14:29.214
WH framework summary.

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:31.015
Let's do a quick recap.

00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:33.834
Friends using our famous WH framework.

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:35.880
So what is direction sense.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.140
It's the amazing ability to understand
and figure out positions based

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.550
on movement relative to our basic
cardinal and intermediate directions.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.210
It's like having a built-in
compass that always works.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.830
Why is it important?

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.360
Because it supercharges your logical
reasoning, spatial awareness,

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.920
and problem solving skills.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.160
Which are absolutely crucial for any
analytical role, especially in your exam.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.720
When is this applied?

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:09.420
In competitive exams, obviously, but
also in navigation, logistics, and

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.680
literally any scenario where you need
to understand spatial relationships

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.180
from finding your car in a parking
lot to planning a grand expedition.

00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:23.635
Where is it used in mapping, urban
planning, those cool military strategies,

00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:26.125
and of course your daily commuting.

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:27.355
It's everywhere.

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:28.915
Who needs to know this?

00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:31.375
Well, you, my friends for your exam.

00:15:31.675 --> 00:15:35.155
Also, professionals in
logistics, navigation experts,

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:36.865
pilots, they really need.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.980
And anyone else who needs to
understand how things are related

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.440
in space, how do we master this?

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.180
By visualizing movements, drawing
clear diagrams, applying geometric

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.960
principles like the Python, ORUS
theorem, our best friend and

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.390
diligently tracking relative positions.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.340
Practice, practice, practice.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.710
Fully worked out examples.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:04.500
Alright, let's put theory into practice
with some fully worked out examples.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.570
Pay close attention, friends.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.630
Example, one basic direction
and distance question.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.900
A man walks 10 kilometers north, then
turns right and walks five kilometers.

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:22.560
Then he turns right and
walks 10 kilometers.

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:27.540
How far and in which direction
is he from his starting point?

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:35.145
A five kilometers north, B 15
kilometers east, C five kilometers

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:38.025
east, D 10 kilometers south.

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:43.665
Understand the question before
moving to explanation a. Solution.

00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:49.395
Step one, first, understand the starting
point and the very first movement.

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:53.265
Let's mark the starting
point as O for origin.

00:16:53.775 --> 00:16:59.954
The man walks 10 kilometers north
from O. We'll call this point A. So O

00:16:59.954 --> 00:17:02.865
to A is 10 kilometers heading north.

00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:04.034
Simple enough.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.319
Step two.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.599
Now let's track the second movement
from point A. He turns right,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.699
if he was facing north a right
turn means he's now facing east.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.369
He then walks five kilometers east.

00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:24.970
Let's label this point B. So A to B
is five kilometers towards the east.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.875
Step three time for the third movement.

00:17:28.504 --> 00:17:33.905
From point B, he turns right again
since he was facing east a right

00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:35.824
turn now makes him face south.

00:17:36.304 --> 00:17:37.985
He walks 10 kilometers.

00:17:38.165 --> 00:17:44.044
We'll call this point C, so B2C
is 10 kilometers heading south.

00:17:44.435 --> 00:17:48.129
Step four, let's determine
the final position of our man.

00:17:48.475 --> 00:17:50.425
Relative to his starting point.

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.064
Now look at the movements carefully.

00:17:53.064 --> 00:17:58.584
Friends, he went 10 kilometers
north from O2 A, then he came

00:17:58.584 --> 00:18:01.014
10 kilometers south from B2C.

00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:05.004
Notice something, the northward
movement, 10 kilometers.

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:10.629
And the southward movement, 10
kilometers are exactly equal and in

00:18:10.629 --> 00:18:15.970
opposite directions, so vertically
they cancel each other out completely.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.590
QAM data.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:18.399
Bye-bye.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:24.340
The only net movement is that five
kilometers east from point A since

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.429
point C is 10 kilometers south from B.

00:18:27.614 --> 00:18:34.905
And B is five kilometers east from a and
A is 10 kilometers north from O. The final

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:41.625
point C is actually directly east of our
starting point O. Step five, calculate

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:43.754
the final distance and direction.

00:18:44.205 --> 00:18:49.754
Our man is precisely five kilometers
east from his starting point O. The

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:53.235
correct answer is C five kilometers east.

00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:54.104
Boom.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.040
Example, two shortest distance
and relative direction.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.120
Question.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.120
Ram walks 20 meters north, then he
turns right and walks 30 meters.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.900
Then he turns right and walks 35 meters.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.560
Then he turns left and walks 15 meters.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.660
Then he again turns left
and walks 15 meters.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.000
What is the shortest distance between
his starting point and the final point?

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:28.910
A 15 meters B. 20 meters C 40 meters.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.950
D 45 meters.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.505
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:36.375
Solution.

00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:40.905
Step one, let's meticulously
draw Ram's adventurous path.

00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:49.725
Let our starting point be o. From O Ram
walks 20 meters north to a OA is 20 meters

00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:56.300
heading north from A, he turns right,
which means east and walks 30 meters to b.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.850
AB is 30 meters heading east from B.
He turns right again, meaning south and

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:12.220
walks 35 meters to c. BC is 35 meters
heading south from C. He turns left so

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:19.300
he's now facing east and walks 15 meters
to d. CD is 15 meters heading east.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.090
And finally from D, he turns left
again, which means north and walks

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.600
15 meters to e de is 15 meters.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.480
Heading North Pew.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.070
That's a lot of walking.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.180
Step two.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.250
Now let's calculate the net
displacement along the north south axis.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.090
This is where our net movement
shortcut comes in handy.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.130
Total northward movements.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:51.720
We have 20 meters from OA and another
15 meters from de, so 20 meters plus

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.325
15 meters equals 35 meters north.

00:20:55.284 --> 00:20:56.875
Total southward movements.

00:20:56.995 --> 00:21:01.254
We only have 35 meters
from BC net North South.

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:07.645
Displacement equals 35 meters north
minus 35 meters south equals zero meters.

00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:08.665
Look at that.

00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:13.705
This means his final point E is
perfectly aligned on the same east

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.534
west line as his starting point.

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.034
Oh vertically.

00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:18.745
He's back where he started.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:19.855
Step three.

00:21:20.185 --> 00:21:24.745
Next, let's calculate the net
displacement along the east-west axis.

00:21:25.175 --> 00:21:26.765
Total eastward movements.

00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:33.605
We have 30 meters from AB and another
15 meters from cd, so 30 meters plus

00:21:33.605 --> 00:21:36.665
15 meters equals 45 meters east.

00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:40.505
Total westward movements,
zero nada, nothing.

00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:44.825
Net eastward displacement
equals 45 meters east.

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:47.795
Step four, determine
the shortest distance.

00:21:48.415 --> 00:21:53.995
Since our net north south displacement
is a grand zero, the final point E is

00:21:53.995 --> 00:21:59.605
directly absolutely unmistakably east
of the starting point O. Therefore,

00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:03.835
the shortest distance is simply the
total net eastward displacement.

00:22:04.135 --> 00:22:05.695
No pyt is needed here.

00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:09.745
Friends, the correct
answer is D 45 meters.

00:22:10.044 --> 00:22:11.514
Told you it was simpler.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:15.105
Example three shadow based question.

00:22:15.465 --> 00:22:16.095
Question.

00:22:16.455 --> 00:22:21.045
One morning after Sunrise, Rohan
and Sohan were standing in a park

00:22:21.045 --> 00:22:22.875
with their backs towards each other.

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:26.625
Rohan's Shadow fell
exactly to his right side.

00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:29.175
Which direction was Sohan facing?

00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:30.524
A North?

00:22:30.524 --> 00:22:38.355
B South C East D West understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.130
Solution, step one.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.510
First things first.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.040
Understand the sun's position and
where shadows fall in the morning.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:53.070
The question clearly states it's morning
after sunrise, so where is our sun?

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.800
Naturally, the sun is in the east.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.850
This crucial piece of information
means that all shadows

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.470
will fall towards the west.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.970
Simple physics right?

00:23:03.355 --> 00:23:04.135
Step two.

00:23:04.435 --> 00:23:06.895
Now let's analyze Rohan's shadow.

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:11.815
The problem tells us Rohan's Shadow
fell exactly to his right side.

00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:16.435
Since we know the shadow is always
in the west during morning, it means

00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:18.925
Rohan's right side must be west.

00:23:19.225 --> 00:23:20.005
Step three.

00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.145
From this, let's figure out
which direction Rohan was facing.

00:23:24.574 --> 00:23:29.824
If West is to rohan's right then
logically east must be to his left.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:35.345
Now, if his right is west and his
left is east, then to be consistent

00:23:35.345 --> 00:23:38.975
with our cardinal directions,
Rohan must be facing north.

00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:40.175
Think about it.

00:23:40.415 --> 00:23:43.774
If you face North, east
is right, west is left.

00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:44.225
Bing.

00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:48.865
Step four, finally determine
Han's facing direction.

00:23:49.225 --> 00:23:53.425
The question states, Rohan and Sohan
were standing with their backs towards

00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:58.014
each other, like two friends having
a disagreement, but facing away.

00:23:58.465 --> 00:24:03.625
If Rohan is facing North and they are
back to back, then Sohan must be facing

00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:05.725
the exact opposite direction of Rohan.

00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:07.845
And the opposite of North.

00:24:07.845 --> 00:24:10.545
My friends is unequivocally south.

00:24:10.965 --> 00:24:13.455
The correct answer is be south.

00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:14.715
You got this?

00:24:15.075 --> 00:24:15.705
Thank you.

00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:17.120
See you in the next lecture.
