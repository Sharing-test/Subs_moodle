00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on logical reasoning.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.900
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.830
This is it.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.115
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:12.675
All right, my friend.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.985
Let's talk about logical reasoning.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:20.265
This is a crucial section, especially
for competitive exams, and it's

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:24.795
all about checking your ability
to analyze, evaluate, and solve

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.955
problems using structured thinking.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.985
Basically, it's like a
mental gym, you know?

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.175
It involves understanding the
hidden relationships between facts,

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:39.815
identifying those sneaky patterns,
and then very cleverly drawing valid

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:44.165
conclusions based on whatever statements
or scenarios are thrown your way.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:48.830
The best part, you don't need any
prior subject knowledge for this it.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.500
Purely relies on your common sense,
your analytical skills, and your

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.080
fantastic ability to think clearly and
systematically to deduce logical outcomes.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.130
It's all about applying your
brain, not your textbooks.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.850
Real world relevance.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.860
Now, why is logical reasoning
so important for say an officer?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
Well, my friend, these skills
are absolutely vital for making

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.350
effective decisions in those
super complex banking scenarios.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.235
And of course, for quick problem solving
when a customer throws a curve ball away.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.380
An officer, or frankly, anyone in a
professional role uses these skills to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.570
analyze financial data spot discrepancies
like a Sherlock Holmes of numbers.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.960
You see, and strategize
efficient workflows.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.840
All this ensures smooth operations
and most importantly, sound judgment.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.075
It's not just exam theory, it's
real life application boss.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:56.085
Breakdown of question types based on
our deep analysis of past exam patterns.

00:01:56.235 --> 00:02:00.735
Recurring question formats in logical
reasoning include some big hitters.

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:05.804
First up, the heavyweight champion
puzzles and seating arrangement, making

00:02:05.804 --> 00:02:09.104
up approximately 25 to 30% of the paper.

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:13.785
This is typically the largest
section involving quite complex

00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:18.225
scenarios where you arrange people
or items based on given conditions.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.670
Then we have syllogism around 10
to 15%, which tests your deductive

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.970
reasoning from statements to
determine a valid conclusion.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.400
Next, inequalities about eight to
12% where you deal with relationships

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.050
between elements using symbols like
greater than, less than or equals.

00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:41.125
After that blood relations,
a cozy five to 8%.

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:46.225
That asks you to figure out familial
connections Coding, decoding another five

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:52.644
to 7% is all about deciphering patterns in
coded messages or words, direction sense.

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:56.545
A smaller but tricky, three to
5% checks your understanding

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.040
of directions and distances.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.350
Data sufficiency, about five to 10% asks
you to decide if the given information

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.540
is enough to answer a question, and
finally input output roughly five to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.060
7%, which involves a machine, not a
real one mind you, but a hypothetical

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.710
one that processes an input following
a specific rule to produce an output.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.600
Quite a lineup, isn't it?

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:28.515
Formulas plus tricks now for the
formulas part, but honestly, logical

00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:32.295
reasoning is more about clever
rules and strategic approaches

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:34.245
rather than mathematical equations.

00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:37.350
You know, for syllogism,
remember these visual aids.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.720
All A or B means A is a
subset of B. No, A is.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.960
B means A and B have no overlap at all.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.670
Some A or B means A and B
have at least some common part

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.700
not empty and some A are not.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.200
B means there's some part of A
that's outside B, for either our

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.570
cases, which we call complimentary
pairs like some A RB plus no A is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.115
B. Or all a RB plus some A are not.

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.185
B, the conditions are crucial.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:14.075
Both conclusions must be individually
false and the subject and

00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:16.595
predicate must be exactly the same.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:17.675
Very important.

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:18.365
Don't miss this.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:24.240
I. For inequalities, think of a
common path to compare two elements.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.450
Make sure there's a continuous
path between them without

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.980
any conflicting symbols.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.960
Priority wise, if symbols like greater
than, greater than or equal to and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.220
equals are in the path, the greater
than symbol takes the highest priority.

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:41.615
Then greater than or
equal to and then equals.

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:45.455
If you see opposite signs,
like greater than and less than

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:49.085
appearing in the path between two
elements, then sorry my friend.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:51.455
No definite conclusion can be drawn.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:55.295
It's like a traffic jam of
symbols in blood relations.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:58.565
Always, always use a systematic diagram.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:04.355
Symbols for gender, like a plus for male
minus for female, and generations are key.

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:08.585
Vertical lines for parent, child,
horizontal for siblings, and a

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:13.055
double horizontal for a spouse makes
life so much easier for coding.

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:13.625
Decoding.

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.305
Put on your detective hat.

00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:20.195
Look for alphabetical position shifts,
maybe reverse alphabetical order, or

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:24.905
even funky pattern changes like special
coding for vowels versus consonants.

00:05:25.294 --> 00:05:29.794
And for those big puzzles and seating
arrangement questions, always, always

00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:31.625
start with definite information.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:36.995
Use tables or diagrams like circular or
linear setups to organize everything.

00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:40.265
And a pro tip, no down
negative information.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.655
Like who is not sitting
next to whom separately.

00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:45.484
This helps avoid confusion later.

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:52.365
Methods of solving logical reasoning
problems, my friend, absolutely demand

00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:54.915
systematic approaches for syllogism.

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:59.715
Start by drawing when diagrams for
each statement represent universal

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:04.305
affirmative, universal negative,
particular affirmative, and particular

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:05.910
negative statements with precision.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.430
Then combine these diagrams to
represent all statements together.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.660
Now analyze each conclusion
based on your combined diagram.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.860
If a conclusion is definitely true
from your diagram, mark it true.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.050
If it's definitely false, mark it
false, and if it's possibly true, but

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.580
not certainly true, meaning it could
be true in some scenarios, but not all.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.330
Then for definite conclusion
questions, it's considered false.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.719
Finally, don't forget to check for
either our cases if no definite

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.280
conclusion directly follows.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:44.505
For puzzles and seating arrangement,
first read the entire problem very,

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:49.155
very carefully to grasp the context
and all the elements involved.

00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:54.165
Then draw a basic structure, a
circle for circular arrangements,

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:57.015
parallel lines for linear or a grid.

00:06:57.075 --> 00:07:02.565
For those more complex puzzles,
identify and directly place any definite

00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:05.445
information onto your structure or table.

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:11.395
Convert all those conditional statements
into small, manageable notes or symbols.

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:13.945
Start linking related conditions.

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:16.164
To deduce even more information.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.805
Use elimination systematically.

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:25.284
If a person absolutely cannot be in a
certain spot, just mark it out and when

00:07:25.284 --> 00:07:30.355
definite information runs out, consider
possibilities one by one, methodically.

00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:37.065
When tackling inequalities first pinpoint
the two elements you need to compare.

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:41.955
Then trace the path between these two
elements through the given statements.

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:47.055
Jot down all the directional signs
you encounter, like greater than,

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:52.605
less than, greater than, or equal
to, less than or equal to or equals.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.365
If all the signs between the elements.

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.775
Point in the same consistent direction.

00:07:57.984 --> 00:08:01.825
For example, only greater than
and greater than or equal to.

00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:06.474
If you're reading left to right, then
a conclusion can be drawn based on the

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:08.905
priority of signs we discussed earlier.

00:08:09.294 --> 00:08:15.145
But my friend, if conflicting signs
appear like A is greater than b and B

00:08:15.145 --> 00:08:20.215
is less than C between A and C, then
no definite conclusion can be drawn.

00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:21.445
Simple as that.

00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:27.284
For blood relations, it's all about
creating a clear family tree diagram.

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:32.355
Using standard symbols represent
individuals and their gender clearly.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:38.174
Draw lines for relationships, vertical for
parent, child, horizontal for siblings,

00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:40.995
and a double horizontal line for a spouse.

00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:45.380
Go step by step, adding each piece
of information to your diagram.

00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:50.489
And finally deduce the exact
relationship by tracing the parts

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.410
in your perfectly drawn diagram.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.290
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.850
All right, listen up for some clever
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.140
First up, option elimination
for multiple choice questions.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.460
You can often knock out incorrect
options super quickly without

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.050
fully solving the entire problem,
especially useful in syllogism or

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.480
inequalities, A real time saver.

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:19.155
Always, always use a
diagrammatic approach.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:24.074
Venn diagrams, seating charts, family
trees, visualize the information.

00:09:24.405 --> 00:09:28.665
This significantly reduces your
mental load, and more importantly,

00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:32.864
the chances of making a silly
mistake for negative information.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:33.495
Convers.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.520
If a statement says, X is not sitting
next to Y, don't just read it and

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.530
forget it, rephrase it, or mark it
very clearly as a constraint rather

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.225
than trying to place someone directly.

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:47.865
Focus on definite clues.

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:48.255
First.

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:52.605
In puzzles, always kick off with
statements that give you concrete

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:57.855
positions or relationships before you even
glance at the conditional or vague ones.

00:09:58.245 --> 00:10:02.595
Variable substitution for inequalities
if you are stuck mentally.

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:06.045
Substitute simple numbers for
variables to quickly check

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.560
the validity of an inequality.

00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:12.465
In straightforward cases, it's like
a mini proof for coding, decoding.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:13.240
It's all about.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.710
Pattern recognition.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.870
Look for common coding patterns, like
reverse order, simple alphabetical

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.000
shifts, plus one minus one, plus
two minus two, or perhaps even

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
vowel consonant specific coding.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.290
And finally, time management.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.485
This is golden allot specific
time to each question type.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.500
If a puzzle is taking too, too
long, be smart, move on and come

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.250
back if time permits, don't get
stuck in a mental quicksand.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.465
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:51.015
Now let's talk about the pitfalls, my
friend, so you don't fall into them first.

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:55.875
Assuming facts, never ever use
outside knowledge only deduce

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:59.955
conclusions from the information
explicitly given in the statements.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.585
Your common sense beyond the
problem, park it outside.

00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:08.655
Second overlapping Venn diagrams
indiscriminately in syllogism.

00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:13.875
Be super careful not to force an overlap
or separation where the statements

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.615
don't explicitly guarantee it.

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:18.405
It's a precise art, not a free for all.

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:20.845
Third, misinterpreting some.

00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:27.265
Some means at least one, remember, not
necessarily not all, it's a common trick.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.965
Fourth, ignoring either or cases.

00:11:30.325 --> 00:11:34.705
Failing to identify those complementary
pairs in syllogism can lead to

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.835
absolutely incorrect conclusions.

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:37.945
Keep an eye out for them.

00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:41.695
Fifth, rushing through
statements, especially in

00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:43.495
puzzles, a single misread word.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.400
Can lead you down a completely wrong path.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.569
Read carefully.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.949
Take your time initially.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.719
Sixth incorrectly.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.270
Applying gender in blood relations.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.740
Do not, I repeat.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.000
Do not assume gender based on
a name unless it's specified.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.079
A is the child of B Does not
tell you a gender does it.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.209
Seventh directional errors.

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:06.795
In direction sense.

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:11.474
Mixing up left right turns or cardinal
directions is a classic mistake.

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:14.834
Always visualize yourself
facing the given direction.

00:12:15.194 --> 00:12:17.535
And finally, ignoring constraints.

00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:22.785
Missing or forgetting a crucial condition
in a puzzle is a recipe for disaster.

00:12:23.145 --> 00:12:27.104
Keep all constraints in your mind,
or better yet on your rough sheet.

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:29.775
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:33.435
Let's quickly sum it up with
our W Edge framework, shall we?

00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:35.835
So what is logical reasoning?

00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:40.335
It's the process of using structured
thought to analyze information

00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:42.045
and draw valid conclusions.

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.085
Why is it important you ask?

00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:48.195
Because it's key for assessing
analytical skills, problem solving

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.800
abilities, and decision making.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.500
Which are crucial for various job roles.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.030
When is it applied?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.680
Well, it's applied Whenever you need
to solve problems, make decisions,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.100
or understand relationships
between different data points.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.720
Where can you apply it?

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.250
Areas include competitive exams,
your daily life problem solving

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.070
and professional decision
making in the workplace.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.415
Who benefits from it?

00:13:12.765 --> 00:13:17.205
Friends, professionals, and anyone
needing to make informed judgements

00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:21.165
or solve complex problems, benefits
immensely from these skills.

00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:22.725
And how is it applied?

00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:27.645
It's supplied by systematically
analyzing, given information, identifying

00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:32.210
patterns, and deducing logical outcomes
through various techniques like

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.650
diagramming or precise rule application.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.050
Clear as day, right?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.300
Fully worked out examples.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.590
Let's dive into some practical
examples, my friend, so you can

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.270
see how it all comes together.

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:51.150
Example one syllogism question statements.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.979
All books are pens.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.050
Some pens are pencils.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.030
Conclusions one.

00:13:57.329 --> 00:13:59.699
Some books are pencils two.

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.349
No book is a pencil.

00:14:01.824 --> 00:14:08.454
A only conclusion one follows B,
only conclusion two follows C. Either

00:14:08.454 --> 00:14:12.025
conclusion one or two follows D neither.

00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:13.855
Conclusion one nor two.

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:19.090
Follows understand the question
before moving to explanation solution.

00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:24.405
Step one, draw when diagrams
for statements statement one.

00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:26.175
All books are pens.

00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:31.155
Imagine drawing a circle for books
completely inside a larger circle.

00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:35.475
For pens, it's like a small fish
inside a big pond, you know,

00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:38.805
statement two, some pens are pencils.

00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:44.565
Now draw a circle for pencils that
overlaps with a portion of the pen circle.

00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:46.155
This is important.

00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:51.815
It can overlap with the book circle
or it might not, as per the statement.

00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:56.285
Some pens or pencils, we aren't
forced to overlap with books.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:59.105
Step two, analyze conclusions.

00:14:59.495 --> 00:15:00.425
Conclusion one.

00:15:00.695 --> 00:15:02.315
Some books or pencils.

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:07.520
From our combined Venn diagram, we
absolutely cannot definitively say

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.740
that books and pencils overlap.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.990
They might or they might not.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.790
The statement, some pen are pencils
simply doesn't force the pencils

00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:18.860
to touch the books, part of pens.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.910
Therefore, conclusion one
does not definitively follow.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.030
Conclusion two, no book is a pencil.

00:15:26.454 --> 00:15:31.255
Similarly, my friend, we cannot
definitively say no book is a pencil.

00:15:31.584 --> 00:15:35.994
They might not overlap or they
might, the given statements just

00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:40.584
don't provide enough information to
guarantee this absolute separation.

00:15:40.854 --> 00:15:45.505
Therefore, conclusion two does
not definitively follow Step

00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.244
three, check for either or.

00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:49.795
Case now, pay close attention.

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:50.845
Conclusions.

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:51.235
One.

00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:56.365
Some books are pencils and
two, no book is a pencil form,

00:15:56.365 --> 00:15:58.255
a classic complimentary pair.

00:15:58.615 --> 00:16:02.905
Both conclusions involve the
exact same two elements, books

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.245
and pencils, and crucially.

00:16:05.425 --> 00:16:09.745
Both conclusions are individually
false, meaning they are not

00:16:09.745 --> 00:16:11.815
definitively true from the statements.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:18.640
In such a scenario if one is true, the
other simply must be false and vice versa.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.650
This is the telltale sign of an
either or situation, correct.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.730
Answer C, either conclusion,
one or two follows.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.140
Example two.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.340
Blood relations question
pointing to a photograph.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:38.140
Ram said she is the daughter of
the only son of my grandfather.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.319
How is the woman in the
photograph related to Ram?

00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:48.535
A mother, B sister, C cousin, d
daughter understand the question

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:51.564
before moving to explanation solution.

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:55.795
Step one, break down the
statement from Ram's perspective.

00:16:56.185 --> 00:16:58.285
Let's dissect this piece by piece.

00:16:58.314 --> 00:17:02.725
From Ram's point of view, my
grandfather, this refers to Ram's

00:17:02.725 --> 00:17:04.855
paternal or maternal grandfather.

00:17:04.974 --> 00:17:05.845
Simple enough.

00:17:06.365 --> 00:17:08.224
Only son of my grandfather.

00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:10.385
Now this is the crucial phrase.

00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:15.545
If Ram's grandfather is his paternal
grandfather, then the only son

00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:17.435
would logically be Ram's father.

00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:22.835
If Ram's grandfather is his maternal
grandfather, then the only son would be

00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:25.415
Ram's uncle, meaning his mother's brother.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.500
However, the phrase only
son is the key, my friend.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.830
If Ram's grandfather has only one son and
Ram is part of that family lineage, then

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.310
that only son simply must be Ram's Father.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.510
Think about it.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.470
If it were Ram's uncle, then
Ram's father would also have

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.940
to be a son of the grandfather.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.750
Which would contradict the only son part.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.870
So it points directly to Ram's father.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.950
Step two, identify the
only son of my grandfather.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.880
This person, my dear friend, is
none other than Ram's father.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.570
Got it.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.160
Step three, relate the woman to
the only son of my grandfather.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.260
The statement says she is the daughter
of the only son of my grandfather,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.420
so putting our deduction in.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.920
It means she is the
daughter of Ram's father.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.450
See how it simplifies?

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.660
Step four, determine
the relationship to ram.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.220
If she is the daughter of Ram's
father and Ram is also his father's

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.170
child, then it's crystal clear.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.580
She is Ram's sister.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.350
No rocket science here, correct.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.770
Answer.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.120
B. Sister.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.410
Example three.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:40.770
Inequalities question statements P,
greater than Q, greater than or equal to.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:47.010
R, equal to S, less than T, less
than or equal to U. Conclusions one.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:53.130
P greater than S two Q, less than
U. A. Only conclusion one Follows

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.335
B, only conclusion two follows.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.200
C. Either conclusion, one
or two follows D. Both.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.210
Conclusion one and two follows E.
Neither conclusion one nor two.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.370
Follows Understand the question
before moving to explanation solution.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.420
Step one.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.220
Analyze conclusion one.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:18.770
P. Greater than S, let's trace the path
from P to S in the given statement.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.690
P. Greater than Q, greater
than or equal to R, equal to S.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.210
The symbols along this path are
greater than, greater than or equal

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.520
to and equals notice all symbols
are pointing in the same direction,

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.470
indicating that P is indeed greater
than the elements that follow the

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.330
dominant symbol among greater than.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.190
Greater than or equal to and
equals is clearly greater.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.790
Therefore, B, greater
than S definitely follows.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.020
This one's a winner.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.840
Step two, analyze conclusion two.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:57.210
Q, less than U. Let's look at the path
from Q to U in the given statement.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.440
Q. Greater than or equal to R, equal to
S, less than T, less than or equal to UR.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.180
Now pay close attention here.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.730
Notice the presence of opposite symbols.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.270
We have.

00:20:09.955 --> 00:20:14.514
Q, greater than or equal to R, which
implies Q is greater than or equal

00:20:14.514 --> 00:20:20.335
to R, and then later S, less than
T, which implies S is less than T

00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:25.105
because there are conflicting opposite
directional symbols greater than and

00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:29.965
less than appearing in the path between
q and u. No definite relationship

00:20:29.965 --> 00:20:31.804
can be established between Q and you.

00:20:32.475 --> 00:20:35.415
It's like trying to drive
in two directions at once.

00:20:35.775 --> 00:20:39.495
Therefore, Q less than you
does not Definitely follow

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.715
Step three combined results.

00:20:41.955 --> 00:20:43.485
So what did we find?

00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:46.125
Conclusion one definitely follows.

00:20:46.275 --> 00:20:47.295
Conclusion two.

00:20:47.415 --> 00:20:49.635
Does not follow correct answer.

00:20:49.845 --> 00:20:52.245
A only conclusion one follows.

00:20:52.515 --> 00:20:53.145
Thank you.

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:54.560
See you in the next lecture.
