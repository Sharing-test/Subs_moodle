00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.870
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on inequality.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.920
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.100
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.030
Explanation.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.240
Inequality in the world of reasoning
ability refers to those questions based

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
on mathematical comparisons between
different elements or variables.

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:27.145
These questions cleverly use
standard relational symbols.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:32.005
You know, like the greater than, the
less than the greater than or equal to

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:37.735
the, less than or equal to, and of course
the ever so simple equal to science.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:43.285
Your ultimate goal here, my friend, is to
determine the true relationship between

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:49.135
specified elements based on a given set of
statements involving these very symbols.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.320
Essentially it's a test of your logical
deduction skills and how well you

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.720
understand relational hierarchies.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.000
No rocket science, just pure
logic, real world relevance.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.720
Now, why is this important
for an officer like you?

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.240
Well, understanding inequalities
is absolutely vital for comparing

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.070
financial data, assessing various
risks, and evaluating performance

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.660
metrics in the real world.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.660
It allows you to quickly discern whether
a value is superior or inferior, which

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.710
is super crucial for making sound
judgements in your daily operations.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.110
Imagine a balance sheet and you are trying
to figure out which numbers are tipping.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.080
The scales inequalities help you do
just that and quickly break down off

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.060
question types based on past exam
patterns for your upcoming exam.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.620
Inequality problems typically pop
up in a few interesting formats.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.789
First up, we have direct
inequalities, which account for

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.060
a good 55 to 65% of questions.

00:01:56.285 --> 00:02:01.655
Here a single or combined statement is
given and you just need to figure out if

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.995
one or more conclusions follow from it.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:10.325
Simple, right next around 15 to 20% are
missing symbol or fill in the blanks.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:15.845
Questions in these statements have one
or more inequality, symbols missing, and

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:21.155
you need to be a detective selecting the
option that makes a given conclusion true.

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:24.665
Then comes reverse inequalities making up.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.049
10 to 15%.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.149
This is where the conclusions are given
as true and you need to work backward.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.170
Finding which set of statements
actually supports those conclusions.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.630
Bit like solving a mystery novel, huh?

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.180
Following that, we have the famous
either or cases, about five to 10%.

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:48.885
This happens when two conclusions are
individually uncertain, but together they

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:53.835
cover all possible relationships leading
to that classic either or scenario.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:57.645
And finally though,
less common, zero to 5%.

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.525
Sometimes you might
encounter coded inequalities.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.610
While often a separate topic, it
can be a subtype where symbols are

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.810
replaced by codes, just like you
might see in a coded topic question.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.880
It's all about deciphering the
secret language formulas and tricks.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.930
Let's talk about the bread and
butter, the basic inequality.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.530
Symbols.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.870
A greater than B means A is greater than
B. A less than B means A is less than B, a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.620
greater than equal to B means A is greater
than or equal to B. A less than equal

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.510
to B means A is less than or equal to B.
And A equal to B means well, A is equal

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.660
to B. Now for the hierarchy of symbols.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.750
Think of it like a pecking order.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.589
The strongest are greater
than and less than are strict.

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:57.299
Inequalities then come greater
than equal to and less than equal

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.579
to the inclusive inequalities.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.739
And finally at the bottom.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.614
But equally important is equal to
the equal for deriving relationships.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.495
There are some key tricks.

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:13.845
First, for a definite relationship
to exist between two elements.

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:19.154
All inequality signs between them must
point in the same consistent direction.

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:22.665
It's like everyone facing
the same way in a parade.

00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:27.255
Second, if a definite relationship
exists and both strict, like

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.175
greater than or less than.

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:33.445
And inclusive, like greater than
equal to or less than equal to

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:34.975
signs are present in the path.

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:35.875
Guess what?

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:38.335
The strict sign always prevails.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:42.475
If only inclusive signs and
equal to are present, then the

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.275
inclusive sign will determine it.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.005
Simple logic, isn't it?

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:51.375
And third, if you ever encounter opposite
signs, like greater than, less than

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:55.545
or less than, greater than between
two elements, immediately know this.

00:04:55.755 --> 00:04:58.965
No definite relationship can
be established between them.

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:01.935
It's like trying to go
two directions at once.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.925
You just can't get anywhere.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:05.815
Methods of solving.

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:10.675
All right, let's get down to the brass
tacks, how to solve these puzzles.

00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:13.765
The first method is combining statements.

00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:18.445
If you're given multiple statements,
for example, A greater than B.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:24.185
B, greater than equal to C, c. Equal
to D, your smart move is to combine

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:26.405
them into a single continuous chain.

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:32.135
Just identify the common elements and
link them up, for instance, A greater

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:37.620
than B, greater than equal to C, equal
to D. C. How neat and tidy that looks.

00:05:38.445 --> 00:05:43.575
Next we have tracing the path For each
conclusion, you need to check first,

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:47.385
identify the two elements, whose
relationship needs to be determined.

00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:51.465
Then simply trace the path
between these two elements in your

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:53.174
beautifully combined statement.

00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:55.215
It's like following a treasure map.

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:59.745
After tracing, you apply the
hierarchy and consistency rules.

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:01.805
Check for same direction.

00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:06.935
Make sure all signs along the traced
path point in the same direction, like

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:12.695
A, greater than B, greater than C, or
A, less than B, less than C if they

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:14.344
are pointing in different directions.

00:06:14.465 --> 00:06:16.534
No definite conclusion is possible.

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:17.395
Full stop.

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:21.625
If they are in the same direction,
then you look for the strongest sign.

00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:23.935
Determine the strongest sign present.

00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:27.805
In that path, this strongest sign
will be your final relationship.

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:32.695
For example, for P. Greater than
Q. Greater than equal to R. The

00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:35.065
strong sign greater than determines.

00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:40.685
P greater than R, and for P, greater
than equal to Q, equal to R. The

00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:45.005
inclusive sign greater than equal
to determines P, greater than equal

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.405
to R. It's all about power play.

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:50.730
Now, the tricky part,
handling either or cases.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.190
This situation arises when individual
conclusions are false or cannot be

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.780
determined, but when you combine them,
they magically cover all possibilities.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.230
There are specific conditions
for this either or to occur.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.760
First, both individual conclusions
must be uncertain, either

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.590
false or cannot be determined.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.720
Second, the elements involved in both
conclusions must be exactly the same.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:20.255
And third, the combination of both
conclusions must cover all three

00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:25.445
possibilities greater than, less
than and equal to common either or.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.825
Scenarios usually happen if the
derived relationship is a greater

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:35.015
than equal to B, and your conclusions
are a greater than B and a equal to.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:40.305
Or if no definite relationship can be
established at all, maybe due to those

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:46.455
pesky opposite signs and conclusions are
A greater than B, a less than B, or A

00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:52.315
equal to B, or perhaps combinations like A
greater than B and a less than equal to B.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.290
Got it.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.840
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.650
Let me share some clever
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:01.750
Think of the gate concept.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.430
Visualize inequality, symbols
as little gates for greater

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.260
than and greater than equal to.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.640
Think of an open gate from left to right
for less than and less than equal to.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.349
It's an open gate from right to
left and for equal to, it's an

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.300
open gate in both directions.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.380
Free passage.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.270
You can only pass through a gate if it's
open in the direction you are moving.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:31.610
So to establish a relationship from
A to Z, all gates between A and

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.829
Z must be open in the direction
from A to Z. Simple, right?

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.949
Then there's immediate
opposite sign detection.

00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:43.479
As soon as you encounter something
like A greater than B, less than C,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:48.969
or A, less than B, greater than C, you
should immediately know that no definite

00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:51.489
relationship exists between A and C.

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:54.189
This saves you precious
time from tracing further.

00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:57.165
Just like spotting a dead end on a map.

00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:01.725
Also practice mental chain
building for simple statements.

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:06.015
Train your brain to combine them mentally
without having to write out the full

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:09.645
chain and always focus on start and end.

00:09:10.065 --> 00:09:14.745
When you are checking a conclusion like
X, greater than Z, only trace the path

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:19.485
from X to Z completely ignoring other
irrelevant parts of the statement.

00:09:19.755 --> 00:09:21.705
Don't get distracted by the noise.

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:22.725
Finally.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.850
Understand the power of signs.

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:29.800
Remember that strict inequalities
greater than less than are stronger

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.760
than inclusive ones, greater
than equal to less than equal to.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.569
If a strong sign is present
in a consistent path, it

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.280
totally dictates the outcome.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.990
It's the boss of the group.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.780
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.959
Now, let's talk about the
potholes on this road.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.390
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:52.375
First reversing signs incorrectly.

00:09:52.795 --> 00:09:58.555
Don't confuse a greater than B with B
greater than A. Remember, A greater than B

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:03.864
is perfectly equivalent to B, less than A.
It's just looking from a different side.

00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:09.204
Second, ignoring equal to don't
assume equal to is a weak sign

00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:10.645
that can just be brushed aside.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.730
A equal to B means A and B are
interchangeable for comparison

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.470
purposes with other elements.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.790
They're like twins.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.240
Okay.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.970
Third, over concluding from no conclusion
if no definite relationship can be

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.620
established, say due to opposite
signs, please do not assume a greater

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.390
than or less than relationship.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.150
It simply means it cannot be determined.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.370
Uncertainty is an answer to.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.630
Fourth misinterpreting either or
don't incorrectly apply the either

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.340
or case when conditions, especially
covering all possibilities are not met.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.200
Always, always check if the two
conclusions truly cover all possible

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.345
outcomes between the elements.

00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:57.325
And lastly, careless Combining
making errors when linking

00:10:57.325 --> 00:11:01.555
multiple statements can lead to a
completely incorrect overall chain.

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:06.355
Be meticulous, like a good
Detective WW framework summary.

00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:11.725
Let's quickly summarize this whole
inequality saga using our WW framework.

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.975
So what is inequality?

00:11:14.335 --> 00:11:15.535
It's about questions.

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:18.895
Assessing logical relationships
between elements using

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:20.380
standard inequality symbols.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.250
Why do we study it?

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.840
Because it's crucial for evaluating
logical deduction, analytical

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.970
thinking, and quick comparison skills.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.130
Very important for your exam.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.600
When is it applied?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.560
Frequently in competitive exams,
reasoning sections to test

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.120
your inferential reasoning.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.530
Where can you find it?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.270
It's common in banking.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.110
SSC railway and other government
entrance examinations.

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:47.099
Basically it's everywhere.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.599
Who needs to know this?

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.520
All your friends and aspirants.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.430
Preparing for aptitude
based competitive exams.

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:55.020
And how do you conquer it?

00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:58.709
By combining statements,
tracing parts, and applying

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:00.510
the clear rules of inequality.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.339
Hierarchy and consistency.

00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:05.189
Just follow the recipe fully.

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:05.819
Worked out.

00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:06.660
Examples.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.745
Let's look at some fully
worked out examples.

00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:11.814
Example one.

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:14.785
Direct inequality question.

00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:15.955
Statement.

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:23.485
P. Greater than Q, greater than equal to
R, equal to S, less than T. Conclusions

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:30.720
one P greater than R two s, less than
p. A only conclusion one is true.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.420
B. Only conclusion two is true.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.810
C. Both conclusions one and two are true.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.170
D, neither conclusion one nor two is true.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.620
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.110
Solution.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.339
Step one.

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:48.500
Let's analyze conclusion one.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.800
P greater than R. From the given
statement, the path between p and R is P

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.770
greater than Q, greater than equal to R.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.760
Notice all signs are pointing in the
same direction towards p. The signs

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.219
involved here are greater than, which is
strong and greater than equal to which

00:13:09.219 --> 00:13:11.890
is weak according to our hierarchy rule.

00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:16.089
The strong sign greater than
prevails, therefore be greater

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:17.890
than R is definitely true.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.589
Take that one off, step two.

00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:27.035
Now let's analyze conclusion two s less
than p. From the statement, the path

00:13:27.035 --> 00:13:33.425
between S and P is P, greater than Q,
greater than equal to R, equal to S.

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:39.455
If we read this from P to S, the path
looks like P, greater than Q, greater

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:45.275
than equal to R, equal to S. Again,
all signs are in the same direction.

00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:46.765
Pointing towards P.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:52.405
The signs involved are greater than, which
is strong, greater than equal to which

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:57.835
is weak and equal to which is the weakest
since greater than is the strong sign.

00:13:58.015 --> 00:13:58.855
It prevails.

00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:03.985
So we get P. Greater than S
and P. Greater than S is simply

00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:06.865
equivalent to S, less than P, right?

00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:10.855
Therefore, S less than P
is also definitely true.

00:14:11.215 --> 00:14:11.935
Another tick.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.140
Step three.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.949
Time to select the correct
option since both conclusion

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:19.020
one and two are definitely true.

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:24.959
The correct option my friends, is C.
Example two combining multiple statements,

00:14:25.319 --> 00:14:32.189
question statements, A greater than
equal to B, C, greater than A D, less

00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:39.270
than equal to C. Conclusions one B
less than C, 2D, less than equal to B.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.360
A only conclusion one is true.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.970
B. Only conclusion two is true.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.180
C. Both conclusions one and two are true.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.390
D, neither conclusion one nor two is true.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.720
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:56.035
Solution.

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:58.795
Step one, first order of business.

00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.795
Combine these statements
into a single need chain.

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:07.735
We have a greater than equal to
B, then we have C greater than A.

00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:12.895
Combining these two gives us C
greater than a greater than equal to.

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:18.845
Now we add D, less than equal to C.
Combining this with what we have.

00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:23.525
D, less than equal to C, greater
than A, greater than equal to

00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:25.715
B. There's your complete chain.

00:15:26.045 --> 00:15:31.750
Step two, let's analyze conclusion
one B, less than C. From our combined

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:37.930
statement, the path between B and C is C,
greater than A, greater than equal to B.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.240
Reading from C to B, all signs are
pointing in the same direction towards

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.060
C. The signs involved are greater than.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:50.825
Which is the strong one and greater
than equal to which is the weak one.

00:15:51.155 --> 00:15:53.225
The strong sign greater than prevails.

00:15:53.314 --> 00:16:00.185
So we get C greater than B and C greater
than B is just the same as B, less than C.

00:16:00.485 --> 00:16:03.425
Therefore, conclusion
one is definitely true.

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:04.025
Bravo.

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:05.405
Step three.

00:16:05.555 --> 00:16:11.405
Now for conclusion 2D, less than equal
to B. From our combined statement, the

00:16:11.405 --> 00:16:17.345
path between D and B is D, less than
equal to C, greater than A, greater than

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:22.775
equal to B. Look closely friends between
D and B, there are opposite signs.

00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:27.125
Specifically you see less
than equal to from D to C, and

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.955
then greater than from C to a.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:33.839
When opposite signs pop up in the
path, remember our rule, no definite

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:35.699
relationship can be established.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.119
Therefore, conclusion two
is not definitely true.

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:40.410
It's uncertain.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:45.810
Step four, select the correct option
since only conclusion one is true.

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:49.199
The correct option is a example three.

00:16:49.515 --> 00:16:50.385
Either or.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:53.505
Case question Statement.

00:16:53.954 --> 00:17:02.355
M. Greater than N. Equal to O. Greater
than equal to P, less than Q. Conclusions

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:11.474
one M greater than p. Two M equal
to PA only conclusion one is true.

00:17:11.775 --> 00:17:14.505
B, only conclusion two is true.

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:18.405
C. Either conclusion one or two is true.

00:17:18.735 --> 00:17:22.395
D, neither conclusion one nor two is true.

00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:26.175
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.030
Solution.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.230
Step one.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.750
Let's analyze conclusion one.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:39.760
M greater than P from the statement, the
path between M and P is M, greater than

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.320
n equal to O, greater than equal to PC.

00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:49.985
All signs are pointing in the same
direction towards m. The signs

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:56.465
involved are greater than our strong
contender equal to the weakest and

00:17:56.645 --> 00:17:59.254
greater than equal to the weak one.

00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:02.675
The strong sign greater
than prevails here.

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:08.855
So M, greater than P is the definite
relationship derived from the statement.

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:12.395
Therefore, conclusion
one is definitely true.

00:18:13.205 --> 00:18:14.105
Step two.

00:18:14.345 --> 00:18:20.645
Now let's analyze conclusion two
M equal to P from the statement.

00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:24.995
As we just determined in step
one, the definite relationship

00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:27.305
is M, greater than P.

00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:33.095
So if M is definitely greater
than P, can M also be equal to p?

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:34.215
Nope.

00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:38.385
Therefore, M equal to
P is definitely false.

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:43.425
Step three, we need to check
for the either or case for

00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:45.344
an either or case to apply.

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:51.074
Both individual conclusions must
be uncertain or false, and together

00:18:51.254 --> 00:18:53.534
they must cover all possibilities.

00:18:53.955 --> 00:18:56.600
But in this specific case, conclusion one.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.900
M greater than P is definitely true.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.670
And conclusion two M equal
to P is definitely false.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.100
Since conclusion one is already true,
there's no either or situation here.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.330
The answer is just only
conclusion one is true.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.870
Now, a quick side note, a common trap,
sometimes friends immediately look for

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.880
an either or without first accurately
figuring out the definite relationship.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.150
What if the original statement
had led to M greater than equal

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.760
to P instead of M, greater than P?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.070
For instance, if the statement
were M greater than equal to N,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:44.170
equal to O, greater than equal to
P, then the derived relationship

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:50.470
between M and P would be M greater
than equal to P in such a scenario.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.220
Conclusion one.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.610
M greater than P would be
uncertain because M could also

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.340
be equal to P. Conclusion two.

00:19:59.639 --> 00:20:05.340
M equal to P would also be uncertain
because M could be greater than P,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:12.510
but together M greater than P or M
equal to P perfectly covers M greater

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:17.514
than equal to P. In that different
scenario, the answer would indeed be.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:24.290
Either conclusion one or two is true,
but based on our Devon statement, M,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:30.470
greater than n equal to O, greater
than equal to P, less than Q. The

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.960
strongest sign in the consistent path
from M two P is greater than meaning.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.129
M greater than P is the
definite conclusion.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.030
Since M greater than P is true, M
equal to P must be false, so the answer

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.790
is just only conclusion one is true.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.920
This highlights the importance of getting
that definite relationship right first.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.230
Step four, select the correct
option since only conclusion one.

00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:02.304
M greater than P is definitely true.

00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:03.594
Based on our statement.

00:21:03.834 --> 00:21:06.834
The correct option is a thank you.

00:21:06.985 --> 00:21:08.370
See you in the next lecture.
