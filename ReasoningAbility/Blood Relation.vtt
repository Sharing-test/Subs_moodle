Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on blood relation.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.270
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.655
Concept explanation.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:15.645
All right.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:20.145
My friends, blood relation, as the
name suggests, is a fascinating

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.884
topic in reasoning ability.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:27.075
It's all about understanding and
analyzing the various relationships that.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:31.715
Tie a family together, whether
they're based on ancestry or marriage.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.685
Think of it like being
the family detective.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:39.185
To ace these problems, you just
need to accurately identify

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.045
how everyone is connected.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:45.905
Perhaps by sketching out a quick
family tree in your mind or on paper

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.305
using some clever logical deduction.

00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:52.685
The main goal, my friend, is to
correctly figure out if someone

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.205
is a parent, a child, a sibling.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.080
A grandparent, a grandchild, an aunt, an
uncle, a niece, a nephew, or a spouse,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.450
all based on the information given.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.860
Easy peasy, right?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.350
Real world relevance.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.880
Now, why is understanding
relationships so important you ask?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.160
Well, it's absolutely crucial in our
daily lives for clear communication

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.260
and smooth social interactions.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.485
Imagine calling your aunt your cousin.

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:25.595
Oops.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.495
In a banking role, for instance,
accurately interpreting these

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:34.085
relationships can be super vital
for tasks like verifying customer

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:38.645
information or handling those sensitive
family related financial matters.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.140
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.460
Blood relation questions generally
fall into three main categories.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.280
First up, we have direct relation
questions making up about 50% of the pie.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.899
These are pretty straightforward
statements, just describing relationships

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.880
between two or more individuals.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.130
Your job is to deduce a specific
relationship from these direct statements.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.410
Then accounting for about 30%,
we find coded relation questions.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.190
Here, relationships are expressed using
codes or symbols, like A plus B means A

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.410
is the father of B. You simply need to
decode the given expression to unravel

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.690
the relationship between two entities.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.730
And finally, around 20% are puzzle
or dialogue based questions.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.040
These are a bit like a family drama,
presenting a scenario where someone points

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.230
to another person or talks about them.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.340
You then have to figure out the
relationship based on the dialogue

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.140
or a set of complex, interconnected
statements often involving more family

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.910
members than a wedding reception.

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:55.185
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:55.485 --> 00:03:00.135
Now, don't worry, my friends, there are
no complicated mathematical formulas

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:04.935
here, no calculus or trigonometry
to stress about, but mastering blood

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:09.495
relations definitely involves some
very clever representational tricks.

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:14.325
The most effective trick hands down
is drawing a family tree diagram.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:15.405
For males.

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:18.195
You can use a plus sign or a square.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:24.075
For females, a minus sign or a circle
works wonders when it comes to spouses.

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.225
Use a double-headed
arrow or a double line.

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:31.905
Siblings can be connected with a
single horizontal line, and for the

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:36.734
parent-child relationship, a vertical
line downwards or upwards with

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:38.745
the parent always above the child.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.700
Is perfect.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.160
Keep individuals on the same horizontal
level for the same generation, and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.110
obviously on different vertical levels
for different generations mentally.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.120
Organizing individuals by generational
levels, grandparents, parents,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.955
self, children, grandchildren.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:03.924
We'll also save you headaches and always,
always, always try to identify gender.

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:08.005
This little trick significantly
narrows down your possibilities.

00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:11.725
Trust me, methods of solving.

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:16.165
All right, let's get down to the
nitty gritty, my friends, with our

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.365
step-by-step methods for solving
these common blood relation problems.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.060
Method for direct relation questions.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.700
Drawing a family tree first, start with
the very first person mentioned and try

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.859
to establish their gender if you can.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.870
For every new relationship, add the new
person to your tree, connecting them

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.820
to existing members, using those neat
symbols we just discussed for gender,

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.700
spousal sibling or parent-child relations.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.390
Just build that tree step by step,
making sure every new piece of

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.609
information is perfectly represented.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.859
Once your family tree is fully charted,
simply locate the two individuals whose

00:04:56.859 --> 00:05:00.914
relationship is being asked and trace the
path between them to find the connection.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.500
Method for coded relation questions.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.000
First, you absolutely must understand
the meaning of each symbol.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.030
For example, plus means father, minus
means mother, X means brother, and so on.

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.979
Then break down the given coded
expression into smaller, manageable pairs.

00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:24.385
Start from one end, usually the
left, and deduce the relationship

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:26.065
for each pair one by one.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:30.355
Combine these deduced relationships
to find the final relationship

00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:32.065
between the required individuals.

00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.905
Alternatively, you can always
draw a family tree based

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.525
on these decoded relations.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.130
Method for puzzle or
dialogue based questions.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.169
For these, identify the speaker and
the person being referred to break

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.219
down the statement into smaller,
more manageable parts, focusing on

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.750
those off or whose clauses first as
they often hint at a closer relation.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.909
A smart trick here is to work backward
from the end of the statement or from

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.860
the most specific relation mentioned.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.080
For example, if someone says, he is
the son of my father's only sister.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.100
Start with my father's only sister.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.840
That's your aunt, right?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.080
Then the son of your
aunt becomes your cousin.

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.810
See how that simplifies Things always
construct a mental or physical family tree

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.300
as you decode each part of the statement.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.510
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some shortcuts.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.159
My friends, of course, you do.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.900
Working backwards, especially in those
tricky dialogue based statements,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.590
start from the end of the statement and
work your way back to the beginning.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.140
This truly simplifies
the deduction process.

00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:42.265
Gender elimination.

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:46.615
If the question asks for a specific
relationship, say sister-in-law,

00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:50.455
and you can clearly determine the
person's gender to be male, boom.

00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:55.075
You can immediately eliminate all
female specific options and vice versa.

00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:56.845
One liner deduction.

00:06:57.235 --> 00:07:01.315
For simpler direct relations, try
to combine statements into a single

00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:04.645
mental chain of relationships
instead of drawing a full tree.

00:07:05.164 --> 00:07:06.965
Option checking for MCQs.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.465
In some cases, particularly with
coded relations, you might be able

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:15.275
to test the given options against
the decoded expression if direct

00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:17.195
deduction seems a bit complex.

00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:23.344
Self-referencing when a statement uses
my or mine, just treat my as yourself

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:25.234
and build the relation from there.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.290
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.700
Now let's talk about the pitfalls,
my friends, the common mistakes

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.130
we all make confusing gender.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.020
Never, ever assume gender based on
a name, like thinking Kirin must be

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.180
female without explicit information.

00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:45.784
Always wait for gender to
be specified or implied by

00:07:45.784 --> 00:07:48.575
relationship mixing up generations.

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.104
This is a big one.

00:07:50.525 --> 00:07:51.215
Incorrectly.

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:54.905
Placing individuals on the wrong
generational level in your family tree

00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:59.375
leads to blunders in relationships
like confusing a grandparent or child

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.099
with a parent or child ignoring only.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.640
Overlooking tiny but mighty words
like only son, only daughter, or only

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.360
child, can significantly restrict
the number of family members and

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.790
change relationships incorrectly.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.870
Interpreting in-laws, misunderstanding
terms like brother-in-law.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.280
Remember that could be your wife's
brother, your sister's husband, or your

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.385
husband's brother, or even aunt or uncle,
which could be maternal or paternal.

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:30.049
Overcomplicating simple problems.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:35.150
Sometimes we get so carried away drawing
intricate trees for questions that could

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.220
be solved with a quick mental deduction.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.179
Don't overthink it my friend.

00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:41.804
WH framework summary.

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:45.555
Let's quickly sum it up with
our simple WH framework.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:47.445
So what is blood relation?

00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:50.955
It's the study of familial
relationships based on either

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:52.725
biological ties or marriage.

00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:54.195
Why do we study it?

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:58.665
Because it tests your logical reasoning
and analytical skills, which are super

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:01.155
crucial for problem solving in any exam.

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:03.105
When is it applied in real life?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.569
Well, it's a staple in various
competitive exams, especially those

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:09.219
with a reasoning ability section.

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:11.140
Where is it used in real life?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.430
It's all around us for family
lineage and of course in various

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.959
puzzles and logical games.

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:17.469
For fun.

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:19.240
Who needs to master this?

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.350
All my friends.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.550
Preparing for competitive exams
like your exam, and really anyone

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.270
looking to sharpen their logical
thinking and how do we solve these?

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.310
By constructing family trees, decoding
symbols, and using logical deduction

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.930
based on the given statements.

00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:37.574
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:38.475
Let's see.

00:09:38.475 --> 00:09:45.045
Some real action with a few fully worked
out examples, shall we Example one direct

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:48.584
relation question pointing to a man.

00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:53.145
A woman said his mother is the
only daughter of my mother.

00:09:53.564 --> 00:09:55.845
How is the man related to the woman?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.110
A son?

00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:05.315
B Nephew, C brother, D uncle understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.790
Solution.

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:14.610
First, let's analyze the my part.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.980
The woman says my mother.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.819
So let's consider the woman's mother next.

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:23.520
Analyze only daughter of my mother.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:28.680
The woman's mother has only one
daughter since the woman is speaking.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:31.740
She herself is the only
daughter of my mother.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:38.030
Now combine the parts, the statement
cleverly becomes his mother is me.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.570
The woman finally deduce the relationship.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.630
If the man's mother is the woman, then
logically the man is the woman's son.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.560
Correct?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.570
Answer is a son.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:58.280
Example, two coded relation question
if P plus Q means P is the father of

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:06.455
Q. B minus Q means B is the mother of
Q and B into Q means B is the brother

00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:12.935
of Q. Which of the following means
A is the daughter of C, A, C plus B,

00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:22.565
minus A, B, C, minus, A plus B, C, C
in two, B minus A D, C plus A minus B.

00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:25.925
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.530
Solution First, understand the codes.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.380
Plus means father, minus
means mother, X means brother.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:47.790
Now, let's analyze option A, C
plus B minus A. C plus B means C

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.970
is the father of B, so C is male.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.800
B minus A means B is the
mother of a. So B is female.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:04.540
If C is the father of B and B is the
mother of A, then C is a's grandfather.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.200
So A is C'S granddaughter or grandson.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.455
This does not mean A is the daughter
of C. So this option is out.

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:20.625
Let's analyze option B, C minus
A plus B. C minus A means C is

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:23.595
the mother of A, so C is female.

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:28.510
A plus B means A is the
father of B, so A is male.

00:12:29.335 --> 00:12:36.625
If C is the mother of A, then A is the
son or daughter of C, but here A is male.

00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:43.945
So A is the son of C. This does not mean A
is the daughter of C. Next, let's analyze

00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:52.315
option C, C, X, B minus A, C, x. B means
C is the brother of B, so C is male.

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:57.580
B minus A means B is the
mother of A, so B is female.

00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:05.495
If C is the brother of B and b is
the mother of A, then C is uncle.

00:13:05.704 --> 00:13:08.464
So A is C's niece or nephew.

00:13:08.824 --> 00:13:13.625
This also does not mean A is the
daughter of C. Finally, let's

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:16.775
analyze option D, C plus A minus.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.510
C plus A means C is the
father of A, so C is male.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:30.370
A minus B means A is the mother of
B. So A is female from C plus a. C

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.474
is indeed the father of a. And from
A minus B, we know A is female.

00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:42.324
So if C is the father of A
and A is female, it means A

00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:44.574
is indeed the daughter of C.

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:46.614
This matches our requirement.

00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:52.344
Perfectly correct answer is
D, C plus A minus B. Example

00:13:52.344 --> 00:13:54.415
three, puzzle based relation.

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:58.974
Question A is B sister, C is B's mother.

00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:02.449
D is C's father, E is D's mother.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.360
Then how is A related to D?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:13.160
A grandfather, B grandmother, C
granddaughter, D daughter, understand the

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.170
question before moving to explanation.

00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:21.555
Solution.

00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:24.315
Let's break it down
statement by statement.

00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:33.315
My friend, statement one A is B Sister, so
A is female and A is a sibling of B, B's.

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:34.905
Gender is still unknown.

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:39.495
Statement two C is B's
mother, C is female.

00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:45.655
C is the parent of B. Since A is
B sister C is also a's mother.

00:14:45.835 --> 00:14:48.115
Simple right statement three.

00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:49.975
D is C's father.

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:51.265
D is male.

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:58.105
D is the parent of C. Now, since C
is a's mother and D is C's father,

00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:01.195
then D is a's maternal grandfather.

00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:05.485
See the connection statement
four E is Dee's mother.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:09.310
This statement gives us extra
information about Dee's parent.

00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:14.615
But we actually don't need it to
find a's relation to D. Sometimes

00:15:14.735 --> 00:15:19.444
they add extra info just to confuse
you, but you are too smart for that.

00:15:19.895 --> 00:15:25.235
Now, deduce the relationship between
A and D. We already established

00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:30.964
that C is a's mother and we also
established that D is C's father.

00:15:31.235 --> 00:15:37.564
Therefore, D is the father of a's mother,
which means D is a's maternal grandfather.

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:45.290
The question asks how A is related to D.
If D is a's grandfather and we know A is

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:51.949
female from statement one, then A must be
D's granddaughter, correct answer is C.

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.939
Granddaughter.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.900
Thank you.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.699
C You in the next lecture.
