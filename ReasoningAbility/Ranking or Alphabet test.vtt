Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on ranking or alphabet test.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.790
You don't need a fancy degree
for understanding this concept.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.260
Just a few minutes and an open
mind, we are about to make the

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.640
complicated, ridiculously clear on
this concept with this tutorial.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.340
So pull up a chair and let's get started.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.130
Concept explanation.

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:28.244
All right, so what exactly
are we diving into today, huh?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:33.285
Well, ranking problems, my friend,
are all about figuring out where

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:38.325
folks stand in a line or maybe in a
column based on the hints and clues

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.545
given about their relative positions.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:46.095
It's just like for finding out if
your neighbor JI is ahead or behind

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:49.845
you in the endless queue for the
latest government service, you know?

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:55.175
These problems typically involve
calculating the total number of people

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:59.585
present, finding someone's particular
spot from the opposite end of the

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:05.045
line, or perhaps even identifying the
exact number of people who are chilling

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.145
casually between two individuals.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:12.995
On the flip side, alphabet test problems
are our delightful little tasks directly

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:15.155
related to the good old English alphabet.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.090
This includes challenges, like finding
letters at specific positions, identifying

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.040
hidden patterns in a letter series.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.550
Sometimes it feels like
cracking a secret, doesn't it?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.290
Or even trying to form meaningful
words from a seemingly random

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.850
jumble of given letters.

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:38.825
Occasionally they might ask you to count
letters or words that satisfy certain

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.645
unique conditions within a given sequence.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:47.075
Both of these fantastic topics, my
friend, are absolutely crucial because

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:52.429
they meticulously test your inherent
ability to truly understand and interpret

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.664
positional information, master logical
sequences, and of course, conquer

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.945
alphabetical order with confidence.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.940
Real world relevance.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.149
Now, you might be thinking
to yourself array.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.859
Sir, why on earth do I actually need
to know all this for my daily life

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.500
or my future career array, my friend?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.609
It's quite simple.

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.400
Really, these topics, believe it or not.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.760
Aren't just confined to the pages
of your exam books you see, they

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.680
fundamentally enhance your brain's
amazing ability to properly organize

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.300
and sequence information, which is a
critical skill for almost everything.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
Imagine yourself managing long
winding cues at a busy bank counter,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.680
or perhaps prioritizing various
important tasks at your office, or

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.970
effectively arranging massive amounts
of data in a systematic manner.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.290
This is precisely where these finely honed
skills truly shine in the banking sector.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.210
For instance, a solid understanding of
ranking principles helps tremendously

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.430
in the orderly processing of countless
applications or in arranging crucial

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.320
customer data based on very specific
criteria, all leading to super

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.245
efficient and prompt service delivery.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:14.905
So it's not just about scoring marks my
friend, it's about becoming genuinely

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:17.875
smarter and more organized in real life.

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:25.095
Break down off question types based on the
observation of past patterns in your exam.

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:29.385
Dear Friend, ranking and alphabet
test questions commonly appear in

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:34.725
a few distinct yet very interesting
flavors for ranking the lion's share.

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:40.185
About 30% of the questions is usually
dedicated to finding the total number

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.045
of persons in a row or a column.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.174
This is quite a popular one.

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:48.394
Then comes finding position
from other end, which typically

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:53.345
accounts for a significant 25% of
the questions following closely.

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:58.655
Finding the number of persons between
two persons makes up another solid 20%,

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:04.685
and do be careful with the overlapping or
non-overlapping cases as they surprisingly

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:07.475
contribute about 15% to your score.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.269
Now moving on to the alphabet test.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.070
It's a slightly different ballgame
letter series or alphabetical order

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.260
questions typically hover around
5% and the ever challenging word

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.760
formation or pair formation questions
also contribute a similar 5%.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.340
So as you can clearly see, it's a good
mix of question types, much like a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.010
perfectly balanced Indian Tali offering.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.360
A bit of everything.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:42.690
Formulas and tricks now for the absolute
magic mantras, the secret formulas that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.130
are guaranteed to save your precious
time and your day during the exam.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.110
Pay close attention, my friend.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.630
These are your golden tickets for
ranking formulas to calculate the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.340
total persons in a row when the
position of just one person is clearly

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.909
given from both ends of the row.

00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:03.185
It's a matter of simple logic.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:03.695
My friend.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:09.664
Total equals position from left,
plus position from right minus one.

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:13.745
Remember to subtract one
because you are inadvertently

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.635
counting that poor person twice.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.245
Once from the left and
once from the right.

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:22.205
Now when positions of two
different persons are given.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:25.255
And there are a certain number
of persons between them.

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:28.855
We have two distinct
scenarios, so stay sharp.

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:33.865
The non-overlapping case where the total
number of people is clearly greater

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:38.785
than the combined sum of the left
position, plus right position is quite

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:44.875
straightforwardly calculated as total
equals left position plus right position

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:47.215
plus number of persons between them.

00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:49.135
It's like adding up blocks.

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.425
Simple enough, right?

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.045
But then my friend.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.830
There's the slightly trickier overlapping
case where the total number of people

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.090
is less than the combined sum of
left position plus right position.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.820
Here, the formula changes a bit
total equals left position plus

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.440
right position, minus number of
persons between them, plus two.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.720
Alternatively, if you specifically want to
find the number of persons between them in

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.550
such an overlapping scenario, the formula
becomes number of persons between them.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.140
Equals left position plus right
position minus total minus two.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.810
Keep this particular one super handy.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.440
It's a lifesaver for
position from other end.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.830
To find position from right equals
total minus position from left plus one.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.520
It's exactly like balancing
a simple equation in maths.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.870
Just remember to add one back for
the person themselves because they

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.450
are part of the go and similarly.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.880
Position from left equals total
minus position from right plus one.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.930
See my friend.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.780
Simple arithmetic and a dash of logic.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.740
That's all it takes now
for the smart alphabet test

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.080
tricks, alphabetical positions.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.170
My friends, it is absolutely essential
that you commit to memory the

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.900
alphabetical position of each and every
letter from A equals one B equals two.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.510
All the way to zed equals 26.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.776
A super smart trick, a jugar, if you
will, is to always use E-J-O-T-Y 5, 10,

00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:29.830
15, 20, 25 as your quick reference point.

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:35.845
You can also use other mnemonics
like C-E-F-I-L-O-R-U-X, or even

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:37.345
learn the reverse positions.

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:41.845
It's like having your phone speed
dial for letters, opposite letters.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.715
Do try to remember those cool
pairs of opposite letters,

00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:49.435
like A ZBY, CX and so on.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:54.615
A super quick way to verify if they are
indeed opposite is to check if the sum

00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:57.825
of the alphabetical positions totals 27.

00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:04.604
For example, A is one and Z is
26, so one plus 26 equals 27.

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:09.615
It's like they perfectly complete each
other, just like a hot cup of chai and

00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:11.655
a crispy biscuit on a rainy evening.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.099
Methods of solving.

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:18.690
So my curious friends, how do we
confidently tackle these challenging

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.979
beasties in the exam hall?

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:21.210
You ask simple.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:27.210
We have a meticulously crafted battle plan
ready just for you for ranking problems.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.710
First things first.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.049
Always visualize the row or column.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.880
Either mentally draw a clear picture,
or if you are like me and prefer

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.720
tangible aids, quickly draw a
simple line on your scratch pad to

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.255
visually represent the arrangement.

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:44.355
This simple act helps a lot, trust me.

00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:49.665
On this one then meticulously
identify given information clearly.

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:53.805
Note down all the positions provided,
whether it's from the left, right,

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:58.515
top or bottom, and any other crucial
information about the total number of

00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:02.954
people or who's comfortably sitting
between whom clarity is key Here.

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:06.020
Next, it's time to apply
the relevant formula.

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:11.285
Based on what exactly is given to
you and what needs to be found, just

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:15.485
intelligently select the appropriate
formula from our list of magic mantras.

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:20.795
No need to reinvent the wheel, and
this next point is absolutely crucial.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:24.275
My friends always handle
overlapping cases with care.

00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:29.105
If the sum of the positions from both
ends look suspiciously bigger than the

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:33.600
total number of people, then bingo, you've
got an overlapping case on your hands.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.290
You absolutely must adjust your
calculations using the specific

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.060
overlapping formula we discussed.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.740
Remember this, if the problem explicitly
asks for the minimum number of

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.480
people, then always, always, always
consider the overlapping scenario.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.310
But if it's asking for the maximum
number, then of course confidently

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.290
go for the non-overlapping scenario.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.950
Got it.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.150
Finally simply deduce and calculate.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.260
Just patiently substitute the given
values into your chosen formula

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.060
and perform the calculations.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.770
Easy peasy lemon squeezy as they
say for alphabet test problems.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.370
Always, always a good idea
to write down the alphabet.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.320
If you ever feel a tiny bit unsure
about letter positions under the immense

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.520
exam pressure, just quickly scribble
down the entire English alphabet

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.445
from A to Z on your scratch pad.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.740
There's absolutely no shame
in doing that, my friend.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.030
It's being smart.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.330
Then number the alphabet, assign numbers
from one to 26 to each letter to quickly

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.700
and accurately identify their positions.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.610
This is like doing a proper
roll call for your letters.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.065
Next, it's critical to
identify the pattern or.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.080
For letter series questions,
truly stare at the letters,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.210
analyze the gaps between them.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:56.430
Is it plus two minus three, or check if
they are alternate letters, or perhaps

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.350
even in reverse alphabetical order.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.900
Your mission is to find the hidden secret
code for word formation questions when

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.800
they hand you a jumble of letters and
challenge you to form meaningful words.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.830
Just try to form as many
as you possibly can.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.260
List out all possible combinations.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.100
But please my friend, do not invent
new English words for the sake

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.510
of the exam pay very, very close
attention to directional counting.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.970
Read the question extremely carefully.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.780
Are they asking from the left
hand, from the right hand to the

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.610
left off or to the right off?

00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:33.824
The specified direction matters a
lot, just like choosing the correct

00:11:33.824 --> 00:11:35.834
left or right turn at a crossroads.

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:41.354
And finally, a quick check on case
sensitivity if applicable, though it's

00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:45.885
quite rare in these competitive exams,
just be aware if differentiating between

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:49.844
uppercase and lowercase letters actually
matters for that particular question.

00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:53.354
Usually it doesn't, but a
quick mental check won't hurt.

00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:53.744
Will it?

00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:57.615
Shortcuts and smart techniques array.

00:11:57.615 --> 00:12:01.245
My friends who said we always
have to do things the hard way.

00:12:01.635 --> 00:12:06.345
We, Indians are masters of Jugar and
we have some really smart techniques

00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:08.145
and shortcuts up our sleeves too.

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.590
You know, drawing a line.

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:14.715
For simpler ranking problems quickly,
drawing a straight line and marking the

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:21.645
positions like L dash X dash r can often
be incredibly faster than trying to recall

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:27.795
a complex formula, especially for persons
between questions, visuals always, always

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:30.255
help the brain relative positioning.

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:35.205
Instead of getting bogged down with
exact ranks, simply focus on how people

00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:36.915
are placed relative to each other.

00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:42.595
For example, X is three places to
the left of Y. Just means x dash,

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:47.995
dash y, simple, effective, and
to the point, minimum or maximum.

00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:50.575
This my friend, is a golden rule.

00:12:50.575 --> 00:12:54.205
You must engrave in your mind
when the question asks for the

00:12:54.205 --> 00:12:55.915
minimum total number of people.

00:12:56.185 --> 00:13:01.255
Always, I repeat, always consider
the overlapping scenario, and when

00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:05.005
they ask for the maximum total,
then of course confidently go

00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:06.595
for the non-overlapping scenario.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:12.880
This will save you fixed points in those
slightly more complex ranking puzzles.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.390
Your first task should be to
identify the fixed points.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.770
These are the people whose positions
are directly and unambiguously

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.660
stated from one end or the other.

00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:26.635
Once you have these anchors,
you can then easily build the

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:28.555
entire arrangement around them.

00:13:28.795 --> 00:13:32.305
It's like finding the foundation
before constructing a building,

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:36.685
E-J-O-T-Y, or C-E-F-I-L-O-R-U.

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:40.945
For alphabet test, quickly use
these brilliant omic devices.

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:45.595
They help you find approximate letter
positions in a Jiffy, and from there.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.960
You just count a tiny bit forward or
backward for the precise position.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.160
Super useful.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.880
Trust me.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.830
Visualize the alphabet.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.320
For those alphabet serious questions.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.040
Try to mentally or physically
skip letters as per the pattern

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.420
you've cleverly identified.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.970
This little trick saves a lot of
precious time pair counting for questions

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.440
that slyly ask about pairs of letters
with as many letters between them in

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.540
the word as in the actual alphabet.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.570
The best method is to
just physically count.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:24.910
For example, in the word stream for the
letter S, you'd count S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z.

00:14:24.985 --> 00:14:31.675
Through the word similarly for T,
you'd count T-U-V-W-X, Y, Z. Be

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:34.795
methodical and systematic, my friend,
and you won't miss a single pair.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.660
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.940
But my friends, please, please, please
don't fall into these very common traps.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.660
These are the notorious GIA
that will surely cost you

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.670
valuable marks in your exam.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.835
So listen carefully.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.959
Off by one errors.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.860
This without a doubt, is the
most common and frustrating

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.510
mistake in ranking problems.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.860
It's usually forgetting to correctly
add or subtract one or two.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.579
When you are calculating the total
or the number of persons between

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:12.380
others, this often happens because
you either mistakenly include or

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.770
wrongly exclude the very person
whose position is being considered.

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:17.689
Be super careful, my friend.

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:21.140
One small slip can mess up
your entire calculation.

00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:26.865
Confusing left or right, misinterpreting
left of X or right of Y from the

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:30.945
perspective of the entire row versus
the individual's own perspective.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:35.565
Always, always assume a standard
facing direction like everyone

00:15:35.565 --> 00:15:36.975
in the row is facing north.

00:15:37.365 --> 00:15:39.105
Keeping it simple helps a lot.

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:41.605
Overlapping versus non-overlapping.

00:15:41.935 --> 00:15:46.345
Failing to correctly identify whether
the arrangement is an overlapping or

00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:50.635
a non-overlapping case, leads directly
to applying the incorrect formula.

00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:55.345
This is where a large number of friends
unfortunately lose marks, so pay

00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.445
extra attention to this distinction.

00:15:57.865 --> 00:16:03.925
Ignoring immediately treating axis to
the left of Y, the exact same way as axis

00:16:03.955 --> 00:16:08.319
immediately to the left of Y. There's
a significant difference, much like the

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:10.540
difference between near and very near.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.189
Always read the precise wording,
counting errors in alphabet, test

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.209
miscounting letters when you are
identifying patterns, oppositions,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.459
especially when you have to jump letters.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.480
It's a common blunder, so double
check your accounts with utmost care.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.380
Meaningless words, trying
too hard to form a meaningful

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.970
word from a jumble of letters.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.290
And then sadly, accepting a
non-existent word array, my friend.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.070
Don't try to invent new English
words for the sake of the exam.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.390
Always double check.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.050
If you have any doubt though, you
won't have a dictionary in the exam.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.170
So trust your vocabulary, case confusion.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:50.980
Forgetting to consider both the
forward and backward directions.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:55.510
When you are specifically asked to find
pairs of letters in a given word, you

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.460
absolutely need to check both ways.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.360
Just like looking both sides of the
road very carefully before crossing.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.589
W Edge Framework summary.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.690
Let's quickly sum it up, my friend using
the Handy W Edge framework, it's like a

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.210
RapidFire revision before the final show.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.790
So what are these topics precisely?

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.430
They are all about determining positions.

00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:22.344
Totals or hidden patterns within linear
arrangements and alphabetical sequences.

00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:23.635
Simple, isn't it?

00:17:24.115 --> 00:17:25.974
And why do we diligently learn them?

00:17:25.974 --> 00:17:31.554
You ask primarily to assess and sharpen
your logical reasoning, spatial awareness,

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:33.985
and overall data organization skills.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.679
Very practical indeed.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.139
When are they typically
applied in real life?

00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:42.760
Whenever you find yourself needing
to arrange, sort or pinpoint specific

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.570
elements within any kind of sequence,
it's more common than you think.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.090
Where are these concepts
commonly encountered?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.409
Definitely in competitive exams,
of course, but also widely in

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.580
data management tasks, and even in
everyday queue management scenarios.

00:17:57.915 --> 00:17:59.505
Who needs to grasp this knowledge?

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:04.755
Every exam, aspirant, keen data
processors, and fundamentally, anyone who

00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:08.685
deals with ordered information in their
daily professional or personal life.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:11.055
Basically, everyone needs to know this.

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:15.645
And how do you go about solving these
problems effectively by intelligently

00:18:15.645 --> 00:18:20.295
applying specific formulas, by drawing
clear diagrams for better visualization,

00:18:20.505 --> 00:18:24.615
and by meticulously counting each
element based on the given conditions.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.075
There are no shortcuts to smart,
focused, hard work, my friend.

00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:32.655
Fully worked out examples,
cello, my friends.

00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:35.505
Let's dive into some
fully worked out examples.

00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:40.395
Now this is where all our theory
meets practical application where

00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:44.565
the rubber truly meets the road
and you see how it all works.

00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:51.975
Let's go example, one ranking total
persons question in a row of friends.

00:18:52.335 --> 00:18:56.535
ESH is 15th from the left end
and 20th from the right end.

00:18:57.045 --> 00:19:00.315
How many friends are
there in the row options?

00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:04.995
A 34 B, 35 C 36.

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:06.345
D 37.

00:19:06.975 --> 00:19:10.245
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:19:10.635 --> 00:19:12.225
Step-by-step solution.

00:19:12.495 --> 00:19:15.495
Step one, identify the given information.

00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:19.725
Rish position from the left equals 15 ish.

00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:22.155
Position from the right equals 20.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.420
Step two, determine
the applicable formula.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.150
Since the position of one single person,
ESH is clearly given from both ends

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.440
of the row, the correct and applicable
formula to find the total number of

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.139
persons is total equals position from
left, plus position from right minus one.

00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:42.635
So simple, right?

00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:48.185
Step three, apply the formula
and calculate total equals 15

00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:54.755
plus 20 minus one total equals
35 minus one total equals 34.

00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:55.865
Correct answer is.

00:19:56.465 --> 00:19:58.745
A 34, see my friend.

00:19:58.835 --> 00:20:02.705
Simple calculation, clear
logic, and you have your answer.

00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:08.735
Example two, ranking persons
between question in a row of 60.

00:20:08.735 --> 00:20:11.855
Friends Ish's 25th from the left end.

00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:15.665
What is Ish's position
from the right end options?

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:21.155
A 35th B 36th, C 37th, D 38th.

00:20:21.784 --> 00:20:24.784
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:26.915
Step-by-step solution.

00:20:27.155 --> 00:20:30.065
Step one, identify the given information.

00:20:30.455 --> 00:20:36.395
Total friends in the row equals 60 esh
position from the left end equals 25.

00:20:36.725 --> 00:20:41.045
Step two, determine the applicable
formula to find a person's

00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:42.455
position from the other end.

00:20:42.605 --> 00:20:46.565
When the total number of persons and
their position from one end are given

00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:52.775
the formula is position from right equals
total minus position from left plus one.

00:20:53.015 --> 00:20:54.335
It's like finding the balance.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.310
Step three, apply the formula
and calculate position from right

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:05.760
equals 60 minus 25 plus one position
from right equals 35 plus one

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.340
position from right equals 36.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.220
Correct answer is B 36.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.470
Not too difficult at all, my friend.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.080
Is it just a bit of logical thinking?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.800
Example three alphabet
test letter pair formation.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:27.010
Question, how many pairs of letters are
there in the word prepare, which have as

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:32.770
many letters between them in the word as
in the English alphabet series options?

00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:34.155
A none.

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:43.215
B one, C 2D three understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:45.435
Step-by-step solution.

00:21:45.735 --> 00:21:50.145
Step one, write down the word
and number each letter according

00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:51.915
to its alphabetical position.

00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:53.535
This is your first smart.

00:21:54.845 --> 00:22:05.915
P 16, R 18 E five P 16 A one R 18 E five.

00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:10.200
Step two, check for pairs
diligently in the forward direction.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.030
That is from left to right, be systematic.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.120
Let's start with the first P 16.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.310
From the first P 16, we carefully
count onwards, alphabetically,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:28.100
17, 18, 19, and so on P to R 18.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.420
Look closely.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.730
There is exactly one letter.

00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:35.330
R between p and r in the word itself.

00:22:35.629 --> 00:22:36.469
And guess what?

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.939
In the actual English alphabet,
there is precisely one letter

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.480
Q between P and r. Bingo.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.510
So PR is a valid pair.

00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:50.449
Shabash P to E five.

00:22:50.629 --> 00:22:53.929
No, this doesn't match
the alphabetical spacing.

00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:57.980
P two P 16, no direct match here either.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.520
Letters between them are RE, so.

00:23:01.705 --> 00:23:05.335
Two letters in the word, but
zero in the alphabet for direct.

00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:08.814
P two P. P two A, Nope, not a pair.

00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:10.645
P two R 18.

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:12.955
The second R still no match.

00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:18.715
Letters between them are REPA,
which is four letters in the word.

00:23:18.775 --> 00:23:20.695
But only one in the alphabet.

00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.405
P two E five.

00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:24.325
The last E, not a pair.

00:23:24.715 --> 00:23:27.715
Now let's move to the first R 18.

00:23:28.105 --> 00:23:34.285
From the first R 18, counting
alphabetically, 19, 20, and so on.

00:23:34.735 --> 00:23:35.695
R to E five.

00:23:36.275 --> 00:23:36.725
No.

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.615
R to P 16.

00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:39.215
No.

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:40.985
R to a one.

00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:41.525
No.

00:23:41.915 --> 00:23:43.415
R to R. 18.

00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:45.575
The second R. No match here.

00:23:45.845 --> 00:23:47.015
Letters between them.

00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:48.635
REPA.

00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:52.595
So three letters in the word,
but zero in the alphabet.

00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:54.275
R to E. Five.

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:56.615
The last E. No, next.

00:23:56.765 --> 00:24:04.205
Consider the first E five from the first
E five, counting six, seven, and so on.

00:24:04.629 --> 00:24:06.070
E two P 16.

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:06.610
No.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.169
E two A one.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.680
No.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.389
E two R 18.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:10.899
No.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.450
E two E. The last E. No.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.680
Step three.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.290
Now this is crucial, my friend.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.680
Check for pairs carefully
in the backward direction.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.600
That is from right to left.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.560
Don't miss this.

00:24:24.215 --> 00:24:28.865
Let's start from the last E five
on the right, from the last E

00:24:28.895 --> 00:24:33.845
five, counting alphabetically,
backwards six, seven, and so on.

00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:35.735
E to R 18.

00:24:35.795 --> 00:24:37.805
No, E to a one.

00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:39.995
No E to P 16.

00:24:40.085 --> 00:24:40.504
No.

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:41.995
E two, E five.

00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:45.055
The first E, no, E two R 18.

00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:48.265
The first R, no, E two P 16.

00:24:48.295 --> 00:24:51.925
The first P, now for the last R 18.

00:24:51.985 --> 00:24:57.325
From the right, from the last R 18,
counting alphabetically backwards.

00:24:57.415 --> 00:24:59.425
19, 20, and so on.

00:25:00.024 --> 00:25:03.564
R to a one, no, R to P, 16.

00:25:03.655 --> 00:25:05.754
No R to E. Five.

00:25:05.814 --> 00:25:08.995
The first E, no, R to R. 18.

00:25:09.054 --> 00:25:12.205
The first R, no R to P 16.

00:25:12.294 --> 00:25:18.955
The first P. Finally, let's check A
one from A one counting forward in

00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:20.875
the alphabet to match letters on.

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:22.044
Its left in the word.

00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:27.564
2, 3, 4, 5. Ah, A to E.
Look at this my friend.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.890
There are exactly three letters between
A and EBRE in the word, and guess what?

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:39.180
In the actual English alphabet,
there are also precisely three

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.660
letters, B, C, D, between A and E.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.020
So a E is also a perfect pair.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.950
Wonderful.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.060
Step four, count the total
number of unique pairs found.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.670
We diligently found two unique pairs.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:26:00.750
My friend, PR and a e. Correct
answer is C two Shabash.

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:02.820
You are absolutely getting it now.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.290
Keep up the great work.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.190
Thank you.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.990
See you in the next lecture.
