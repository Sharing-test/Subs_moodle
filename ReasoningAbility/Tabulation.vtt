Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on tabulation.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.220
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.400
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.330
Explanation.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.310
So what exactly is tabulation in
the context of reasoning ability

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.900
for your competitive exam?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.170
You ask?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.040
Well, it simply refers to the systematic
organization of all that scatter data

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.830
into a neat table or a grid format.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
Think of it like arranging your
mom's spice box, everything in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.210
its designated place, right?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.280
This process, my friend, helps in
visually arranging discreet pieces

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.070
of information into rows and columns.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.630
Why do we do this?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.150
Because it makes it easier to identify
relationships, draw inferences, and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.280
solve problems super efficiently.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.200
It's all about structuring those scattered
data points into a clear, concise format

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.330
to reveal underlying connections and
patterns, which let me tell you, is

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.090
absolutely crucial for logical deduction.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.080
No more juggling facts in your
head, like a circus performer.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.140
Real world relevance.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.160
Now, you might be thinking,
sir, why should I care about

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.110
tables outside of my exam?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.750
Ah, my friend, let me tell you, in the
banking sector, for instance, tabulation

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.390
is absolutely essential for organizing
and analyzing vast amounts of information.

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:31.184
Quickly and accurately.

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:33.074
It's like their secret weapon.

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:37.934
It helps in things like customer
data management, quickly sorting

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:42.434
and understanding customer profiles,
transaction histories, and even

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.294
those pesky loan applications.

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:49.484
Then this financial reporting where
it structures financial data, like

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:53.565
balance sheets and profit and loss
statements for crystal clear analysis.

00:01:54.154 --> 00:01:55.744
Ever heard of risk assessment?

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:56.705
Oh, yes.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:01.384
Tabulating various risk factors and
their corresponding probabilities

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:03.755
helps them make informed decisions.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:08.375
It's also vital for performance
tracking, organizing employee or

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:12.215
branch performance metrics over
time for comparative analysis.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.430
And for audit procedures, it
systematically arranges audit findings and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.040
discrepancies for review and reporting.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.170
Finally, for loan sanctioning, it
consolidates applicant details, credit

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.190
scores, and collateral information
to streamline the approval process.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.500
See, it's not just for exams.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.565
It's a real world superhero skill.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.090
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.990
All right.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.130
Let's talk about the kinds of
tabulation questions you likely face

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.920
in your exam based on past patterns.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.500
These questions primarily revolve around
arranging and categorizing data, while

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.020
exact percentages can vary, typical
formats include, first up, the big one

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.030
person property matching accounting
for about 40 to 50% of questions.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.785
Here you are given a set of
individuals and multiple attributes

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:09.075
like their profession, city hobby,
or even their favorite color.

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:13.245
Your job is to match each person
with their correct attributes.

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:18.765
This often involves creating a grid
or a jugar table, as we say, to track

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.045
positive and negative associations.

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:27.375
Next we have scheduling or ordering
questions, making up about 25 to 35%.

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.565
This is where you get data related to
events happening on specific days of

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:35.114
the week, months, or at certain times.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:39.195
Your mission is to establish the
correct sequence or assignment.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:45.234
Then comes classification or grouping
about 15 to 20% of the pie here.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:50.274
Items of people are categorized into
groups based on shared characteristics,

00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:52.614
often involving multiple variables.

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:56.695
Sometimes for a little extra
spice, you might get blood

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.555
relations or direction combined.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.440
Tabular data around five to 10%.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.690
This requires a table for organizing
relationships or positions, a true

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.450
brain teaser, and occasionally this
comparison or ranking where data involves

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.460
comparing individuals or items based on
different parameters and ranking them.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.490
A table can really be
your best friend here too.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.450
Formulas plus tricks.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.140
Now don't start looking for a
hidden mathematical formula.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.540
Here my friend Tabulation problems are
less about complex equations and more

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.765
about logical organization and deduction,
but we do have some tricks up our sleeve.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.070
First grid creation always,
always start by drawing a clear,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.990
well labeled grid or table.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.670
Put your entities along one axis
and the attributes along the other.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.100
It's like setting up your battlefield.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.290
Then symbolic notation.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.390
Use simple symbols like a tick for
yes across for no, or a question

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.400
mark for maybe within your table.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.660
To quickly mark confirmed,
rejected, or uncertain associations.

00:05:04.995 --> 00:05:06.555
This saves so much time.

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:08.985
Remember the elimination principle.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.995
If an attribute is assigned to one
entity, it generally cannot be assigned

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:19.605
to another unless it's specified as shared
Systematically eliminate possibilities.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.315
It's like playing Who done it?

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:23.655
Always look for connecting clues.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.135
Often one clue resolves
multiple uncertainties.

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:32.155
And finally distinguish between
direct versus in indirect information.

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:37.224
Prioritize direct statements like
a lives in Mumbai over indirect

00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:40.974
ones, like the person who lives
in Delhi does not like red.

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:45.385
Always go for the easy pickings,
first methods of solving.

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:46.844
All right.

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:50.804
Let's dive into the actual methods
for tackling these tabulation

00:05:50.804 --> 00:05:54.554
problems, covering all the
important and distinct approaches.

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:58.424
First, we have the most
common one, the grid method.

00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:02.804
You identify all the categories
and entities involved, like

00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:04.995
people, cities, or professions.

00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:10.755
Then you draw a grid with entities
along one axis, usually rows and

00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:13.155
attributes along the other, the columns.

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:16.784
Systematically read each
glue and fill in the grid.

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:22.664
Use into for no and tick mark for yes
or any symbols that make sense to you.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.224
Just be consistent.

00:06:24.854 --> 00:06:30.015
After marking a tick mark, immediately
put into in all other cells in that row

00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:34.549
and column for that specific attribute,
assuming it's a one-to-one mapping.

00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:38.675
Then use elimination to
deduce further information.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:42.965
Keep continuously updating your
table as new deductions are made.

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:47.255
It's an iterative process, like
adding ingredients to a recipe.

00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:50.914
Next is deductive reasoning and inference.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.040
Always start with the
most definite statements.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.810
These are your strong points.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.640
Try to combine two or more clues that
provide complimentary information.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.710
Make logical inferences based on what
is stated and what can be deduced

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.510
from the absence of information.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:15.310
For example, if A is not B and A is not
C, and only D remains, then A must be D.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.590
It's just simple logic, my friend.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.400
Then we have positive and
negative information tracking.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.480
It's smart to maintain separate
lists or sections within your rough

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.530
work for confirmed information,
which is positive and rejected

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.210
information, which is negative.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.130
Use negative information effectively to
eliminate possibilities in your grid.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.680
For instance, if X does not like blue,
mark an X right there in the X blue cell.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.570
Every X helps clear the path for
sequencing or ordering problems.

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:52.520
We often use the flow chart or chain
method when dealing with events or

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.930
people in a sequence like days of the
week, create a linear representation.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.150
Think of it like a simple numbered list.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.275
Place definite items first.

00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:05.505
Use arrows or placeholders to
indicate relative positions.

00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:11.175
For example, A greater than B means
A is before B. Fill in the gaps as

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:13.005
more information becomes available.

00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:16.605
This often works best with
our trust grid method.

00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:19.425
Finally, there's iterative refinement.

00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:22.005
Don't expect to crack it in one go.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:24.315
Go through the clues multiple times.

00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:27.495
Your first pass is just
for direct information.

00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:31.635
The second and subsequent passes
are for combining clues and

00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:35.025
making those clever inferences
that weren't apparent initially.

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:39.495
And please, my friend, don't be afraid
to reread clues if you get stuck.

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.495
Sometimes the answer hides in plain sight.

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:44.895
Shortcuts smart techniques.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:49.484
Now for some real jugar, tips are
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:52.064
Always prioritize definite clues.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.685
Start by placing information that is
absolutely certain into your table.

00:08:57.074 --> 00:08:58.515
These are your anchors.

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:00.375
The foundation of your solution.

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:02.805
Learn to use if then logic.

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:07.064
Mentally convert complex clues
into simple if then statements

00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:08.630
to understand their implications.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.860
It simplifies everything.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.110
Always look for linkages, identify
names, items, or attributes

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.880
that appear in multiple clues.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.830
These are often the key to unlocking
the entire puzzle like a master key.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.930
Don't forget marginal notes.

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:28.565
Use the margins of your rough
sheet to jot down quick notes,

00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:32.375
unconfirmed possibilities, or
specific constraints that don't

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.175
fit directly into your main table.

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:39.335
These little notes can save the day and
in multiple choice questions, employ

00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:41.495
the process of elimination for options.

00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:45.225
Once you have even a little
information, check the options.

00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:49.035
Sometimes you can eliminate
incorrect options without fully

00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:50.475
solving the entire puzzle.

00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:52.575
This is a huge time saver.

00:09:52.755 --> 00:09:56.505
Trust me, for time management,
allot a specific amount of

00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:58.365
time for each tabulation set.

00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:03.105
If a puzzle is proving too difficult,
market and move on to save time.

00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:06.015
Returning if time permits don't get stuck.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:08.745
And finally, practice with constraints.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.930
Regularly practice solving tabulation
problems under timed conditions.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.160
This is the only way to truly
improve your speed and accuracy.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.240
Remember, practice makes perfect
or at least makes you faster.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.120
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.400
All right, let's talk about the pitfalls,
the common mistakes and misconceptions

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.080
that friends often fall into.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.300
First misinterpreting clues.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.700
Reading a clue quickly and
misunderstanding its exact

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.230
meaning, like confusing.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.100
X is next to Y, with X
is immediately next to Y.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.810
Details matter, my friend.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.540
Then ignoring negative information.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.120
Many only focus on what is true and fail
to use information about what is not true.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.400
To eliminate possibilities, remember
an X is as powerful as a tick mark.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.205
Also, be careful with
sloppy table drawing.

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:05.839
An untidy or unorganized table can
lead to errors and confusion, making it

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:07.939
incredibly hard to track information.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.449
It's like driving on a messy
road, you are bound to get lost.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.369
A big one is assuming information,
drawing conclusions, or filling in

00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:20.689
cells based on assumptions rather
than explicit or logically Deduced

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:23.119
information is a recipe for disaster.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.680
Stick to facts my friend.

00:11:25.105 --> 00:11:27.415
And please keep updating the table.

00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:31.195
Failing to mark off possibilities
or filling in new deductions as

00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:33.235
you go leads to missed connections.

00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:34.795
Keep your table alive.

00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:37.555
Panicking under pressure is also common.

00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:42.205
Tabulation problems can seem complex
and panicking can lead to errors in

00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:44.365
reading clues or making deductions.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.080
Stay calm, breathe, and be methodical.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.370
It's just a puzzle.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.350
Lastly, ignoring all constraints,
not paying attention to all given

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.060
conditions or specific rules, especially
those involving, not more than at

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.290
least, or specific numeric constraints
can throw your whole solution off.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.645
Read everything carefully.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.130
WH framework summary.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.520
Let's quickly sum it up
with our WH framework.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.500
So what is tabulation?

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.900
It's organizing discreet data into rows
and columns to reveal relationships.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.280
Why do we do it?

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.840
To simplify complex information,
facilitate logical deduction,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.030
and answer questions accurately.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.265
When is it applied?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.880
When you are given scattered data points
that need structured arrangement for

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.090
analysis, where is it primarily used in
reasoning, ability tests, data analysis,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.010
and professional data management.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.330
Who uses it?

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.490
Exam aspirants, data analysts,
banking professionals, researchers.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.460
Basically anyone dealing
with structured data.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.450
And finally.

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:50.655
How do you do it?

00:12:50.954 --> 00:12:55.275
By creating a grid and systematically
filling in positive and negative

00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:57.615
inferences based on given clues.

00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:01.814
Simple, yet powerful,
fully worked out examples.

00:13:02.235 --> 00:13:05.985
Now for the exciting part,
our fully worked out examples.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.895
Let's see how all this
theory comes to life.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.280
Example one question five.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:21.790
Friends, PQRS and T work in five different
banks, S-B-I-B-N-B-B-O, BUBI, and HDFC.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.220
Each friend likes a different fruit.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.555
Apple, banana, cherry, date, and gu.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.000
B works in p and b and does
not like banana or date.

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:33.620
Q likes Apple.

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:36.800
The friend who works in UBI likes guava.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:43.970
R works in BOBS, does not work in HDFC
and does not like Cherry D likes date.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.340
Which bank does S work in?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:52.340
A-S-B-I-B-B-O-B-C-U-B-I-D-H-D-F-C?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.910
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:57.205
Solution.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:00.115
Step one, assign definite facts.

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:06.925
We know P works in PNBQ likes Apple
R works in b, o, b, and T likes date.

00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:11.395
These are us starting anchors,
my friend, step two, deduce

00:14:11.395 --> 00:14:14.275
UBI and guava from Clue three.

00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:17.575
We know the friend who
works in UBI likes guava.

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:23.370
Now PQ, R and T already have their
bank of fruit assigned and none of

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.770
them fit the UBI guava combination.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.420
This leaves S as the only option
available for UBI and guava.

00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:31.980
Simple elimination.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.400
Step three, deduce P'S fruit from Clue
one P does not like banana or date.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.900
We've already assigned guava
to S, apple to Q and date to

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.360
T and P cannot like banana.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.980
So by elimination.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.810
P must like cherry.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.170
Step four, final bank
and fruit assignment.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.780
The only remaining fruit is banana.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:01.020
So R, a friend must like banana
banks, SBI, and HD, F, C are left for

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.970
Q and T, the question specifically
asks about S, final answer.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:12.600
S works in UBI, the correct answer,
my friend is C. Example two question.

00:15:12.925 --> 00:15:18.895
Six people, A, B, C, D, E, and F
are sitting in a row facing north.

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:23.125
Each person has a different
favorite fruit, apple, banana,

00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:28.824
cherry, date grape, and orange B is
sitting at one of the extreme ends.

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:32.694
The person who likes cherry
is an immediate neighbor of B.

00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:37.915
C sits third to the right of the
person who likes grape F likes orange.

00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:42.084
D is an immediate neighbor of
the person who likes banana.

00:15:42.535 --> 00:15:47.635
The person who likes Apple sits second
to the left of f. A is sitting to the

00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:55.194
right of E, which fruit does C, like
a apple, B Banana, C date, D grape.

00:15:55.675 --> 00:15:58.704
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:15:59.970
Solution.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.430
Step one, establish B's.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:08.939
Position B is at an extreme end, either
position one P one or position six P six.

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:14.430
If B, were at P six, placing F and apple
would become contradictory, trust me.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.720
So B must be at P one A
first, solid deduction.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.079
Step two, place B, cherry F, and apple.

00:16:22.755 --> 00:16:26.835
Since B is at P one, the person
who likes Jerry is at P two.

00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:28.035
As they are B's.

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:30.615
Immediate neighbor F likes orange.

00:16:30.944 --> 00:16:35.385
Now, if F is at P five, then the
person who likes Apple sits at P

00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:39.930
three, which is second to the left
off f. This fits perfectly, isn't it?

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:45.329
Step three, place C and grape C sits
third to the right of the person

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:50.310
who likes grape with B already at P.
One for C to be third to the right.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.990
C must be at P four, and B must
be the person who likes grape.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.770
Aha.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.410
Step four, place D and Banana.

00:16:58.964 --> 00:17:02.235
D is an immediate neighbor of
the person who likes banana.

00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:07.964
D cannot be at P six because F is the
only neighbor there, and F likes orange.

00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:13.589
So if D is at P three where Apple is,
then C at P four must like banana.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.290
As other neighbors contradict
the different fruits condition.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:23.109
Therefore, D likes apple and C likes
banana logic, my friend, pure Logic,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:29.320
step five, place A and E. A is sitting
to the right of E. The remaining slots

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.840
are P two, where cherry is and P six.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.750
So E is at P two and likes cherry.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.460
This means A is at P six and likes
date, which is the last fruit remaining.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.860
Final answer.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.360
C likes banana.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.659
The final answer is B. Example three.

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:51.090
Question four, friends, aria,
Ben, Chloe and David each play a

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.959
different sport among football,
cricket, tennis, and basketball.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.610
Each likes a different color among
red, blue, green, and yellow.

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:02.340
Aria plays football and likes red.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.400
Ben does not play tennis.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.020
Chloe likes green.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.970
The person who plays cricket likes
yellow, Chloe does not play basketball.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.950
Which sport does David play?

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.380
A tennis B. Cricket.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:21.320
C Basketball, D football understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:22.575
Solution.

00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:25.485
Step one, assign definite facts.

00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:28.125
Aria plays football and likes red.

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:29.685
Chloe likes green.

00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:31.665
These are our definite starts.

00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:34.275
Step two, deduce Chloe's Sport.

00:18:34.725 --> 00:18:37.245
Chloe likes green from Clue four.

00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:40.935
The person who plays cricket
likes yellow, so Chloe cannot

00:18:40.935 --> 00:18:42.945
play cricket from Clue five.

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:46.725
Chloe doesn't play basketball,
thus by elimination.

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:48.465
Chloe must play tennis.

00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:49.845
See how easy it becomes.

00:18:50.485 --> 00:18:51.265
Step three.

00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:52.975
Deduce Cricket and yellow.

00:18:53.335 --> 00:18:56.635
Since Chloe plays tennis, the
cricket and yellow pen now

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.615
must go to either Ben or David.

00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:00.175
Only two options left.

00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:03.265
Step four, deduce Ben and David's sports.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.880
Ben does not play tennis, which
is consistent with our deductions.

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:12.305
If Ben plays cricket and likes yellow,
then David must play basketball and

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:15.935
like blue, as that's the remaining
spot and color combination.

00:19:16.175 --> 00:19:18.095
This arrangement works perfectly.

00:19:18.335 --> 00:19:20.885
Final answer, David plays basketball.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.565
The final answer is see.

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:23.615
Thank you.

00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:25.265
See you in the next lecture.
