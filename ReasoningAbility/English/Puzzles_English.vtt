00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on puzzles.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.770
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.880
Explanation.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.860
Puzzles in reasoning ability are
logic-based problems that require

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.410
you to arrange people, objects, or
information based on a given set of clues.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.980
These problems are designed to test your
analytical thinking, deductive reasoning,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.530
and the ability to process multiple
pieces of information simultaneously to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.080
arrive at a unique and correct solution.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.050
They often involve scenarios
like seating arrangements.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:44.724
Floor allocations, scheduling
events, or categorizing individuals

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.644
based on various attributes.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.565
The core task is to identify and
establish relationships between

00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:56.185
different entities as described by
the clues, real world relevance.

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:00.339
These skills are highly relevant,
especially for professional

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.179
roles that require analytical
thinking and decision making.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:10.660
For resource allocation banks optimize
staff funds and technology just like

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.729
arranging puzzle pieces efficiently
in fraud detection, spotting unusual

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.949
patterns in financial data to identify
and prevent fraudulent activities is

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:23.710
truly like solving a complex data puzzle.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.920
For customer problem solving.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
Diagnosing complex client issues
means logically connecting various

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.310
symptoms and fragmented information,
and for logistics and scheduling,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
organizing loan approvals or meeting
schedules requires precise arrangement

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.840
akin to solving a time-based puzzle.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.915
See how practical this is my friend.

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:50.085
Breakdown of question types
based on past year exam patterns.

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:54.615
The most frequently recurring puzzle
formats include seating arrangement,

00:01:54.765 --> 00:02:00.765
linear, circular, square, rectangular,
about 35 to 40% of puzzle questions.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
These involve arranging individuals
in specific formations based

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.780
on their relative positions and
directions, floor or box puzzles.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.330
Approximately 25 to 30% of puzzle
questions require assigning persons or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.105
items to different floors of a building
or stacking boxes, one above another.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.250
Scheduling puzzles, day,
month, year, time-based.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.770
About 15 to 20% of puzzle questions
require arranging events or persons

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.420
on specific days of the week, months
of the year, or at particular times.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.160
Categorization puzzles.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.390
Approximately five to 10% of
puzzle questions involve matching

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.560
different variables like people,
professions, cities, or colors,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.840
using a systematic tabular approach.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.970
Blood relation puzzles often combined
and around 5% of puzzle questions

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.710
establish family relationships, sometimes
integrated with seating arrangements

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.440
and comparison or ranking puzzles.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.080
Also, approximately 5% of puzzle questions
involve comparing individuals based

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.640
on attributes like height, weight, or
age to determine their relative ranks.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.160
Formulas plus tricks puzzles.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.570
Don't rely on mathematical formulas,
my friend, but on logical deduction.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.480
Pure and simple key tricks to master.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.250
First visual mapping.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.690
Always create a diagram table or
simple sketch to represent the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.850
given information and relationships.

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.339
Second, apply fixed clues first.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.540
Start by placing information
that is definite and unambiguous.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.554
These are your crucial anchor points.

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:41.864
Third, don't ignore negative information
statements about what is not true.

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:47.774
Example, X is not next to Y are absolutely
crucial for eliminating possibilities.

00:03:48.015 --> 00:03:49.995
Fourth, master linking clues.

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:53.954
Identify connections between
different pieces of information that

00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:55.815
help build the overall solution.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.480
And finally, pay close attention to
boundary conditions close, referring

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.520
to ends in linear, top, bottom, in
flows, or specific day or time slots.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.350
Limit options significantly.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.340
Remember these and your
golden methods of solving.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.540
Now, my friend.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.950
Let's talk about the actual battle plan,
the methods of solving these puzzles.

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:21.265
The Tabulation method is best for
puzzles with multiple variables.

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:25.855
Example, people, their cities, their
professions, and their favorite colors.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.775
You create a grid with rows and columns
representing variables and fill it by

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:35.605
marking confirmed relationships with a
check mark and impossible ones with an X.

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:39.565
Then there's the diagrammatic
mac for seating arrangements.

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:44.005
Draw lines for linear circles for
circular and square or rectangular

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:45.475
shapes for those arrangements.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.219
For floor puzzles, draw a vertical
stack of numbered floors for scheduling.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.960
Draw a calendar like structure.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.640
Visuals are key, right?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.070
The elimination method is powerful.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.180
As you process each glue cross out
possibilities that contradict the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.260
given information, this systematically
reduces the solution space.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.680
When a clue presents multiple equally
probable scenarios, use the case

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.820
building method, create separate
diagrams or tables for each case.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.830
Continue solving each case independently
until only one remains consistent with

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.740
all clues and the ultimate superpower.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.120
Deductive reasoning.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.860
This is where you combine two or more
seemingly unrelated clues to infer

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.820
new information or relationships
that are not explicitly stated.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.875
This my friend, is the absolute.

00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:37.585
Core skill in solving complex puzzles,
shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:41.785
Now, for some pros, my friend, the
shortcuts and smart techniques that

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:43.885
can make you a puzzle solving champion.

00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:46.135
Always start with a first read through.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:50.665
Scan all clues, once to grasp
the overall context and identify

00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:52.135
the most restrictive clues.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.955
Example, X lives on the topmost floor.

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:59.485
Then a crucial point, prioritize
definite over relative information.

00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:03.565
Always begin with clues that directly
state positions or relationships

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.335
before tackling relative ones.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:10.315
Example, X is to the left of Y. Follow
a systematic processing approach.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.115
Address one clue at a time.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:14.635
After integrating a clue, cross it off.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.070
This prevents rereading and
ensures all information is used.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.960
Be a detective and look for chains.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.450
Identify sequences of relative clues.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.550
Example, A is next to B. B is next
to C to quickly form blocks of people

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.100
or items for circular arrangements.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.590
Employ the clever fix
and rotate technique.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.080
Pick one person and fix their position.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.330
Then place others relative to them.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.290
The beauty is the final solution
can be rotated later if needed.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.365
And finally, the most
important shortcut of all.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.080
Practice with timer.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.190
Consistent practice under timed
conditions is essential to improve

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.110
both your speed and your accuracy.

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.180
No shortcuts around that, my friend.

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.460
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.920
Beware these common pitfalls, my friend.

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.409
First misinterpreting directions.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.460
Confusing, left right, especially
in circular arrangements where

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.940
some individuals may face the
center and others outwards.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.560
Always clarify the reference point.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.350
Second adjacent versus next to assuming.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.750
Next to always means immediately adjacent.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.250
Often it implies immediate adjacency
unless context suggests otherwise

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.410
stick to immediate unless stated.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.020
Third, never ignore negative clues.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.210
Overlooking statements like X is not
sitting with Y or A does not live on an

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.640
even floor are critical for elimination.

00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:39.875
Fourth, never make assumptions, inferring
information not explicitly provided.

00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:43.174
Stick, stick, lead to what is
given or logically derivable.

00:07:43.534 --> 00:07:47.705
Fifth incomplete diagrams not
fully drawing the diagram or table

00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:51.245
leading to mental overload and
errors in tracking information.

00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:53.674
Lastly, not separating cases.

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:58.354
Trying to force multiple possibilities
into a single diagram, which often leads

00:07:58.354 --> 00:08:00.544
to confusion and incorrect deductions.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.365
Avoid bees and you'll solve like a pro.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.395
WH framework summary.

00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:08.965
Let's quickly summarize with
the WH framework, my friend.

00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:14.125
What are puzzles, logic problems
requiring systematic arrangement or

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.705
correlation of entities based on clues?

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:21.055
Why learn them to assess
logical reasoning, analytical

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:24.385
skills, and attention to detail
crucial for banking roles.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:29.175
When are they applied in situations
requiring structured thinking,

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:32.924
information organization, and
deductive problem solving?

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:38.174
Where are they essential in competitive
exams and job roles involving

00:08:38.174 --> 00:08:41.985
data interpretation planning,
and strategic decision making?

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.490
Who needs this?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.229
Your exam aspirants.

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:49.880
Banking professionals, data analysts,
and anyone needing critical thinking

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.579
skills and how do we solve them by
using diagrams, tables, systematic

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:59.689
elimination, case analysis, and
careful deduction from clues.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.459
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.229
Let's see, some action.

00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:05.420
My friend with fully worked out examples.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:10.355
Example one box puzzle
question seven boxes.

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:15.455
P-Q-R-S-T-U-V are kept one
above another in a stack.

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:21.425
The lower most box is numbered one, and
the top most box is numbered seven clues.

00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:24.755
Box R is kept on an
even numbered position.

00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:31.760
Only two boxes are kept between R
and q. Q is kept above R, box B is

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.040
kept immediately below box S. Box
T is kept at the topmost position.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.140
Box U is kept below.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.540
Box V. V is not kept immediately
above R. How many boxes are kept

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.970
above box SA one B two, C3, D four.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.230
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.310
For example, one.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.420
Step one, place T. Using the definite
clue there are seven positions,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.450
one Bottom to seven top clue.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.790
Five states T is at the top most
position Position seven T. Step two.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.880
Place r and q using their related clues.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.090
Clue one R is on an
even numbered position.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.490
6, 4, 2, glue two.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.439
Two boxes are between R and q.

00:10:20.094 --> 00:10:20.574
Q3.

00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:28.584
Q is above RQ, mt, Mt. R considering
R's, even positions, if R is at six,

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:30.954
Q would be at nine, not possible.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:36.745
If R is at four, Q would be at seven, but
T is at seven, so this is a contradiction.

00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:39.469
If R is at two, Q would be at five.

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:41.685
This is the only valid placement.

00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:48.975
So position seven T, position five, Q,
position two, R, step three, place s

00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:53.985
and P using their immediate relationship
glue four P is immediately below.

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:56.175
Box s. SP is a block.

00:10:56.535 --> 00:11:04.395
Current occupied positions seven
T five Q2 R positions 6, 4, 3, 1.

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:07.605
We need two consecutive
empty slots for sp.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.360
Possible.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.620
R four comma three.

00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:15.380
If S is at six, P would be at five, but
Q is at five so this is a contradiction.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.010
Therefore, S must be
at four and P at three.

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:21.290
Current state position seven.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.819
T. Position six.

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:24.439
Mt. Position five.

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:30.979
Q, position four s. Position three P.
Position two, R. Position one, empty.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.000
Step four.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.229
Place we and you using their
relationships and remaining constraints.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.790
Clue.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:42.910
Six U is below V. VU is a block V
immediately above U or with spaces clue.

Three B sits to the right of e.

00:14:24.225 --> 00:14:28.005
All facing south, so right means
towards a lower position number.

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:32.745
This means B is at a position
numerically smaller than E. Empty

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:37.335
positions are four, comma five, so
B must be at four and E at five.

00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:44.325
Final arrangement from left to right, A,
D, C, B, E, step five, final verification.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.520

The final arrangement from left
to right is A-D-C-B-E question.

00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:17.595
Who sits to the immediate right of B. B
is at position four, all are facing south.

00:15:17.775 --> 00:15:21.255
Immediate, right means the position
with the next lower number.

00:15:21.525 --> 00:15:24.705
The position immediately to
the right of B four is three.

00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:27.075
C is at position three, correct?

00:15:27.075 --> 00:15:32.090
