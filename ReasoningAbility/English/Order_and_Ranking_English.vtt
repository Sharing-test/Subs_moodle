00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.140
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on order and ranking.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:09.705
Concept explanation.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:12.975
So what is this order
and ranking all about?

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.205
You ask array.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.395
It's a topic in reasoning ability.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:20.715
That's all about figuring out who is
standing where in a line, or who is

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:25.785
taller, shorter, fatter, thinner, or
has more marks than Shama, you son.

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:30.565
You are given certain clues and you have
to become a bit of a Sherlock Holmes

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:35.275
to deduce the correct order position
From all the information provided.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:40.615
It involves understanding concepts like
rank from the top or bottom left or

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:45.445
right, the total number of people and the
number of people between two individuals.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:51.144
This topic truly tests your ability to
analyze and interpret relative positions

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:53.394
and all those hidden relationships.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.800
Real world relevance.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.900
Now, you might be thinking, sir, where
will I ever use this in the real world?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.429
Well, for an officer, these
skills are absolutely pure gold.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.900
They enhance your logical thinking
and data interpretation, which are

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.970
vital for analyzing financial data and
even managing long customer queues.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:20.445
This helps in efficient Q Management
helps in prioritizing important tasks,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:25.755
allocating resources wisely, evaluating
performance, and most importantly,

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:30.195
making quick and very well-informed
decisions when it matters the most.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:33.645
It's the secret sauce for
real world efficiency.

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.225
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:39.885
Let's talk about what kind of
questions you can expect in your

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:42.375
exam based on past patterns.

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:47.565
The blueprint is quite clear about
30, 35% of the time, they will

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:51.225
ask you to find the total number
of persons in a row or column.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:55.005
This is where they give you one
person's position from both hands.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.195
Then with a 20, 25% chance, you'll
see questions on the position

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:01.965
of a person from the other end.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.475
Where you know the total and one rank.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:09.875
Next up with 15 to 20% frequency
is finding the number of persons

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:15.665
between two persons a classic, another
favorite appearing 10 to 15% of the

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.035
time involves interchanging positions.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.640
You know, Ram becomes
sham and Sham becomes ram.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.870
What happens next?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.020
And finally, about 10 to 15% of questions
are comparison based, ranking, arranging

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.990
people by height, weight marks, or age.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.360
So you should prepare accordingly.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.750
My friend.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.350
Formulas plus tricks.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.959
All right, let's get to the magic spells,
the formulas and tricks for finding

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.920
the total number of persons when you
know one person's rank from both sides.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.299
Just remember this.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.340
Total equals rank from left,
plus rank from right minus one.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.720
Why minus one?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.299
Because you counted the poor fellow twice.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.990
Simple, right.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.130
To find the rank from the
other end, you just do total

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.530
minus the known rank plus one.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.100
It is like looking at the
entire line from the other side.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.110
Now, finding the number of persons
between two persons has two scenarios.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.220
If it's a non-overlapping case,
meaning the total is greater than

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.060
the sum of their ranks, the number
of people between them is simply the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.980
total minus the sum of their ranks.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.730
But if it's an overlapping case where
the sum of the ranks is more than the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.040
total, the formula is a bit tricky.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.970
It's the sum of their ranks
minus the total, and then

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.739
you must subtract two more.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.600
These two are the people themselves
and for interchanging positions,

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.829
the total is the new position of the
first person, plus the old position

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.019
of the second person minus one.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.410
The number of people between
them is just the difference in

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.899
positions of one person minus one.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.760
Got it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.450
Good.

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:56.445
Methods of solving.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:04:00.135
Now, knowing the formulas is
one thing, but applying them

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.785
correctly is the real game.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:07.065
So here is the step-by-step method for
calculating photo persons in a row.

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:11.685
First hunt down that one person whose
rank is given from both left and right.

00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:16.635
Add those two ranks, and please
for my sake, remember to subtract

00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:20.415
one from the sum for finding a
person's rank from the other end.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:23.625
Note down the total number
of people and the given rank.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.885
Subtract the given rank from
the total and then just add one.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:32.085
That is your answer when finding
persons between two individuals.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.515
First, you must diagnose the situation.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:37.235
Is it overlapping or non-overlapping?

00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:40.445
If the sum of the ranks from
opposite ends is less than the

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:44.585
total, it's non-overlapping,
if it's more, it's overlapping.

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:48.875
For the non-overlapping case, subtract
the sum of the ranks from the total

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:53.300
for the overlapping case, subtract the
total, and two from the sum of the ranks.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.685
Easy peasy for interchanging positions.

00:04:56.865 --> 00:04:59.385
Always, always draw a little diagram.

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:03.225
Use the new position of one
person and the old position of

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:04.725
the other to find the total.

00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:08.925
The difference in the positions of the
person who moved will tell you how many

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:10.725
people are between them, minus one.

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:15.795
And finally, for comparison based
problems, think like a mathematician,

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:21.795
represent every clue as an inequality,
like a greater than B, C, less than B.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.725
Then combine these little clues
to build the full sequence.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:30.135
Be very careful and read what is
actually being asked in the question.

00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:33.135
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:37.695
Every master has some special tricks
up their sleeve, and you should too.

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:40.125
First, visual representation.

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:43.365
Always draw a simple line mark the people.

00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:46.725
This little drawing will
save you from big confusions.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.635
It helps you see the
problem much more clearly.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.455
Second, focus on relative positioning.

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:56.965
Instead of finding exact numbers,
sometimes just knowing A is

00:05:56.965 --> 00:06:00.474
five places to the right of B
is enough to crack the problem.

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.974
Third, use option elimination
in multiple choice questions.

00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:08.635
If an answer looks completely
impossible, just throw it out.

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.044
Why waste time on it?

00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:12.835
Fourth, focus on the key information.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.825
Find that one clue that unlocks
the whole puzzle, like one

00:06:16.825 --> 00:06:18.655
person's position from both ends.

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:21.534
And finally, practice with diagrams.

00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:24.175
The more you draw, the
faster you will get.

00:06:24.535 --> 00:06:30.295
It builds your intuition, my friend, and
speed common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.409
Now let us talk about the
banana peels on the floor.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.390
The common mistakes so many people
make the most classic blunder is

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.980
forgetting to subtract one when
calculating the total people get

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.560
excited, add the ranks and move on.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.390
Don't be that person.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.125
Another big trap is incorrectly
calculating between.

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.469
You must know if it's an overlapping
or non-overlapping case before

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:59.120
you use a formula blindly.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.849
Also, people confuse between, with
including the word between means

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:09.229
you don't count the two people at
the ends, and please, when you draw.

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:11.685
Be consistent with your left right.

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:15.465
It should be from the perspective
of the people in the row, not

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:20.265
your own left and right, and
don't just blindly apply formulas

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:22.424
without understanding the context.

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:25.815
A formula is a tool, not a magic wand.

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:29.804
Lastly, do not ignore
answers like zero or one.

00:07:30.164 --> 00:07:34.965
Sometimes the number of people between
two individuals is indeed zero.

00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:36.885
It's not a trick question.

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.615
WH framework summary.

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.515
So to wrap up the theory,
let's use the WH framework.

00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:45.165
What are we doing here?

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:49.785
We are determining the position
or rank of individuals or objects

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:51.675
in a sequence or an arrangement.

00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:53.385
Why are we doing this?

00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:58.305
Because it is absolutely essential
for logical reasoning and problem

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:00.345
solving in competitive exams.

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:02.175
When do we apply this skill?

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.690
We apply it whenever we are given
clues about relative positions,

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:10.859
total counts or specific
arrangements that need to be deduced.

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:12.270
Where is it used?

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.739
It is used in your exam, in
logical puzzles, and any place

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:18.809
that needs sequential analysis.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.190
Who needs this?

00:08:20.489 --> 00:08:24.554
Every friend preparing for government
exams, professionals who need sharp

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:29.969
analytical skills and basically anyone
who enjoys solving a good, logical puzzle.

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:32.130
And how do we solve these?

00:08:32.474 --> 00:08:36.824
By using our special formulas,
drawing neat diagrams, and applying

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.604
sharp, logical deduction based on
the given positional information.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:42.585
Fully worked out.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:43.395
Examples.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:44.715
Enough theory.

00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:47.415
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:53.265
Example, one total number of persons
question in a row of friends.

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:57.345
Rohan is 15th from the left end,
and 20th from the right end.

00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:00.795
How many friends are
there in the row options?

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:05.235
A 34 B, 35 C 36.

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:06.735
D 37.

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.750
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.200
Solution.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.280
Step one.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.290
First, understand the problem.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.980
We have Rohan's position from
both the left and right end.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.350
We need the total number of friends.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.870
Step two, apply the formula.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.540
The formula is total equals rank from
left, plus rank from right minus one.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.010
Step three, substitute the given values.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.930
Rohan's rank from the left is
15 and from the right is 20, so

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.710
total equals 15 plus 20 minus one.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.230
Step four, calculate the total.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.730
Total equals 35 minus
one, which equals 34.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.280
Therefore, there are 34 friends
in the row, correct answer, A 34.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.120
Example, two interchanging positions.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.550
Question in a row of girls.

00:09:59.729 --> 00:10:02.880
Rena is 10th from the
left and Tina is 15th.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.939
From the right, if they
interchange their positions,

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.160
Rena becomes 16th from the left.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.140
What is Tina's new position?

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:19.410
From the right end options, a 20th B 21st,
C 22nd, D 23rd understand the question

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.050
before moving to explanation solution.

00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:23.345
Step one.

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.535
Let's note the initial positions.

00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:31.595
Rena is 10th from the left and Tina is
15th from the right Step two after the

00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:34.955
swap, Rena is now where Tina was Rena's.

00:10:34.955 --> 00:10:37.235
New position from the left is 16th.

00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:40.685
Step three, let's find
the total number of girls.

00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:43.985
The formula is total equals Rena's.

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:48.545
New position from left, plus Tina's
old position from right minus one.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.060
So total equals 16 plus 15 minus one.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.380
This gives us 31 minus one,
which means there are 30 girls.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.430
Step four.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.160
Now let's find Tina's new position.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.320
From the right, Tina is now at Rena's
old spot, which was 10th from the left.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.630
Using the formula rank from right
equals total minus rank from left

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.260
plus one, we get 30 minus 10 plus one.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.470
Which is 20 plus one.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.190
So Tina's new position
is 21st from the right?

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:21.910
Correct.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.500
Answer, B 21st.

00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:28.935
Example, three persons between
two individuals question

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.765
in a row of 50 friends.

00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:35.055
P is 12th from the left end, and
Q is 18th from the right end.

00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:44.325
How many friends are sitting between P
and Q options A 19 B, 20 C, 20 1D 22?

00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:47.595
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.380
Step one, let's list what we know.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.990
Total friends equals 50 peace
position from left equals 12 Q's

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.120
position from right equals 18th.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.180
Step two, let's check for overlapping.

00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:06.620
Some of positions equals
12 plus 18, which is 30.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.670
Since the total 50 is
greater than the sum 30.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.829
This is a non-overlapping case.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.880
They don't cross each other.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.490
Step three.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.930
Now we apply the simple formula
for non-overlapping cases, which

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:25.510
is persons between equals total
minus sum of ranks, so persons

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.440
between equals 50 minus 12 plus 18.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.430
That becomes 50 minus 30, which equals 20.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:39.400
Therefore there are 20 friends sitting
between P and Q. Correct answer B 20.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.170
Thank you.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.880
See you in the next lecture.
