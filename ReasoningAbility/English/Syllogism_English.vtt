00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on syllogism.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.920
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.610
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.510
Explanation.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.430
Syllogism, my friends, is nothing
but a fancy name for a logical

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
argument, almost like a court
room drama where we use deductive

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.630
reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
This conclusion is based on two or
more statements or propositions as

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
the big books call them, that we
assume to be true in simpler terms.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.390
It's all about drawing smart
conclusions from given statements.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.010
These initial statements are
our premises and what follows

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.110
logically is our conclusion.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:51.485
The core idea is to understand the
relationship between different categories

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:57.394
or elements mentioned in these statements,
and then like a detective, determine if

00:00:57.394 --> 00:01:00.185
a given conclusion necessarily follows.

00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:06.515
You'll typically be presented with
statements like all A RB, some BRC,

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:12.685
or no C is D. And then your job is
to assess the truthfulness of various

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:14.665
conclusions derived from them.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:19.195
It's like a puzzle, but with
words and much more fun.

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.205
Real world relevance.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:23.995
Now, why is this important for you?

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:25.225
My aspiring friends?

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:31.015
Syllogism truly enhances your logical
thinking, which is absolutely crucial

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:35.605
for a successful career in your
chosen field, especially for problem

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:38.005
solving and decision making skills.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.220
Imagine analyzing complex
financial data or piles of reports.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.570
This skill helps you identify
sound logical conclusions

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.190
from all that information.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.660
It's not just about exams, it's
about making sense of the world.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:54.015
Henna.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:02:00.425
Topics In this journey of syllogism,
we'll cover several interesting topics.

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.975
We'll start with, of course, the basic
syllogisms, the foundation of everything.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:11.765
Then we move to possibility cases where
conclusions might just possibly be true.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.864
We'll also delve into the quirky
only and only a few concepts,

00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:19.054
which have their own special rules.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:25.084
After that, prepare for revers slog
where the game gets flipped and you find

00:02:25.084 --> 00:02:27.125
the statements from the conclusions.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:32.674
We'll then explore coded syllogism,
a modern twist, and finally crack.

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:38.524
The famous either or cases where you have
to choose between two truths but not both.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:40.745
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:46.365
Based on past exam patterns specifically
for your exam, we frequently

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.615
observe a few common question types.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:54.045
Around 40 to 45% of the questions
are usually basic syllogism

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:55.875
statements and conclusions.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:59.655
Here you are given two to three
statements and two to three

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:03.990
conclusions, and you just have to
determine which ones logically follow.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.660
Then about 20 to 25% are possibility
cases where conclusions express A can be

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.260
or might be scenario like some A can be.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.840
B. These need a different approach.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.470
Mind you.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.140
Next, approximately 15 to 20%
of questions are based on only

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.910
and only a few statements.

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:30.015
These statements, friends have
specific interpretations that can

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:31.875
trip you up if you are not careful.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:36.135
Reverse syllogism where you are
given conclusions and must find

00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:40.335
the statements that could lead
to them makes up about 10 to 15%.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:46.365
And finally, the intriguing either or
cases where one of two given conclusions

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:51.315
must be true, but never simultaneously
account for about five to 10%.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:54.045
So be prepared for all flavors.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.560
Formulas and tricks now
about formulas and slog.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.240
They are less like mathematical
equations and more like clever rules

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.430
for combining different statement types.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.980
For instance, if you have all
a RB and all BRC, then you

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.590
can confidently say all a RC.

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.235
This is a direct positive relationship.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.255
Simple, right?

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:23.645
If all a RB and no B is C,
then automatically no A is C.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:30.815
That's a clear negative relationship
when some A RB and all BRC, then some

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:33.170
A RC is a partial positive outcome.

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:39.705
And if some A RB and no B is
C, then it means some A are not

00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:41.895
C, which is a partial negative.

00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:47.984
Things get a bit indirect when
no A is B and all B are C because

00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:54.435
then some C are not A. Similarly
with no A is B and some BRC.

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:59.775
It means some C are not a. Always
remember my friends two particular

00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:05.415
statements, like some, some not, or two
negative statements, like no, some not

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:07.965
generally yield, no definite conclusion.

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:12.555
You cannot derive a conclusion
out of thin air, can you Then we

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:17.055
have complimentary pairs, either
or, which are quite specific.

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:27.185
The common pairs are some plus, no example
some A RB or no A is B. And all plus some,

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:32.165
not example, all A RB or some A are not.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:37.805
B, for these to be an either or case
two conditions are critical first.

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:41.795
Both elements in the conclusion
must be exactly the same.

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:47.975
Like A and B. Second, both conclusions
when checked individually must be

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:50.675
false or not necessarily follow.

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:55.985
If both conditions are met, then
either or is your answer now?

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.515
Methods of solving.

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.365
Now, how do we tackle these problems?

00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:02.735
We have a couple of popular methods.

00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:05.105
One Venn diagram method.

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:06.215
This is.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.409
Hands down, the most popular and intuitive
method, especially for US visual thinkers.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.550
Step one, represent each
statement as a Venn diagram.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.860
Draw circles for each category.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.219
For all a RB, just draw circle A
completely inside circle B, like a

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.289
smaller teacup inside a bigger one.

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:34.474
For some A RB draw overlapping circles,
A and B showing a common area for no.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:40.114
A is B draw two completely separate
circles, A and B, giving them their space.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:45.784
And for some, A, AR, not B, draw
two overlapping circles, A and B.

00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:50.015
And then shade the part of A
that does not overlap with B.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:51.965
Clearly showing what is not.

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:55.835
B. Step two, combine
these individual diagrams.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:59.635
Merch all the diagrams for
the given statements into one

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:01.435
single comprehensive diagram.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:06.325
The trick here is to try and draw all
possible valid arrangements of the

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:08.965
circles to cover every single scenario.

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:11.365
Don't just stick to one drawing my friend.

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:15.414
Step three, check each conclusion
against your combined diagrams.

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:18.340
A conclusion is truly valid.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.140
Only if it holds true in all possible
Venn diagram representations that

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.909
you can derive from the statements.

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:29.530
If a conclusion is true in one
diagram, but surprisingly false in a

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.989
perfectly valid diagram, then sorry.

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:33.940
It does not necessarily follow.

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:37.870
It's like a witness if they
contradict themselves even once

00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:39.700
you can't trust them completely.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.599
Two analytical method, A EIO rules.

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:48.455
This method is a bit more bookish,
involving understanding the four

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:54.244
types of propositions, universal
affirmative, a universal negative E,

00:07:54.604 --> 00:08:00.275
particular affirmative I and particular
negative O, along with their direct

00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:02.645
logical implications and combinations.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:08.515
While it's powerful for beginners, it can
feel more complex and might lead to errors

00:08:08.515 --> 00:08:13.435
compared to our beloved Venn diagrams, it
involves intricate rules of conversion,

00:08:13.675 --> 00:08:15.895
implication, and contra position.

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:21.295
Sometimes the simpler visual method
is best, right shortcuts and smart

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:26.605
techniques now for some jugar and smart
techniques to save your precious time.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.270
When you're drawing Venn
diagrams, always try to draw the

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.340
minimum overlap diagram first.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.180
This small trick helps you quickly
eliminate conclusions that are

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.440
clearly not necessarily true for
possibility rule conclusions.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.680
Remember this, a possibility
conclusion is true.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.690
If it is possible for it to be true in
at least one valid Venn diagram without

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.670
breaking any of the given statements.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.620
Just one possibility is enough.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.610
Don't go searching for
all the word only as all.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.350
Reverse is a crucial one.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.180
When you see only a RB,
immediately think all BRA.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.110
And also understand it
implies a strict exclusivity.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.630
No other category like C or D can
be B. This is a big constraint.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.530
Don't miss it.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.320
Only a few as some plus some not
is another tricky one, only a few.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.290
A RB straightforwardly implies two things.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:28.230
Some A RB and some a R, not B.
Both parts are equally important.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.425
Always categorize conclusions before
you start drawing, quickly scan them

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.980
and identify if they are definite
conclusions or possibility cases.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.520
This helps you apply the correct
checking rule from the get go.

00:09:41.935 --> 00:09:45.235
And for definite conclusions,
a quick elimination trick.

00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:50.125
If you quickly find just one scenario
where a conclusion is false, you don't

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:52.135
need to check further for that conclusion.

00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:55.705
It's out common mistakes
and misconceptions.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.195
All right, listen closely, my friends.

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:00.805
These are the typical
traps that catch many.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.430
Assuming universal from particular.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:10.420
Just because some a RB doesn't magically
mean all a RB, do not assume a universal

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.250
relationship from a particular one.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.990
That's like saying some people
like Ani means everyone likes ani.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.320
Not true, assuming
negative from affirmative.

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:24.240
All A RB does not imply no A is not.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.860
B, you cannot derive a negative conclusion
from purely affirmative statements.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.050
Don't go creating negatives where they
aren't any ignoring no, or some not.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.470
These negative statements are
like strict boundary walls.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.370
They create clear limitations
that must be strictly observed

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.780
in your logical deduction.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.490
Ignore them at your own per.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.040
Overlapping were not implied.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.180
Do not infer relationships that
are not explicitly stated or

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.400
necessarily implied by the premises.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.590
Just because two circles can overlap in
your mind doesn't mean they must based

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.320
on the statements misinterpreting only.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.820
This is a classic.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.430
Only a RB is frequently confused
with all a RB. Remember, only

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:09.935
a RB fundamentally means.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:13.235
All BRA, it's a reverse relationship.

00:11:13.564 --> 00:11:15.334
Misinterpreting only a few.

00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:17.464
Many friends forget the crucial.

00:11:17.464 --> 00:11:19.714
Some are not part of only a few.

00:11:19.714 --> 00:11:22.535
A RB. Remember, it's a two-way street.

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:25.354
Failing to check all possible scenarios.

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:27.694
This is perhaps the biggest blunder.

00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:31.444
A definite conclusion must
hold true for all possible,

00:11:31.444 --> 00:11:33.064
valid, logical interpretations.

00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:36.339
If it fails in even one
scenario, then it's falls.

00:11:37.074 --> 00:11:40.045
And finally mixing up
either or conditions.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:43.525
Don't forget to check both
conditions for either or cases.

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:47.785
Are they a complimentary pair and
are they both individually false?

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:49.465
Both must be satisfied.

00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:51.415
WH Framework summary.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:55.370
Let's quickly summarize Syllogism
using our trustee WH framework.

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:58.444
So what exactly is syllogism?

00:11:58.745 --> 00:12:02.435
It's a logical argument type
using deductive reasoning to draw

00:12:02.435 --> 00:12:04.295
conclusions from given statements.

00:12:04.355 --> 00:12:05.285
Simple as that.

00:12:05.765 --> 00:12:06.965
And why do we learn it?

00:12:07.265 --> 00:12:12.334
Well, it tests your logical reasoning and
analytical ability, which are absolutely

00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:14.675
essential for all competitive exams.

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:16.115
When do you use it?

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.954
Primarily in the reasoning ability
section of competitive exams,

00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:21.694
like your big exam coming up.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.590
Where can you apply this in analytical
reasoning problems, general puzzle

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.250
solving and critical thinking
scenarios pretty much everywhere.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.840
Who should master this?

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.950
Friends preparing for government
and banking exams, and really any

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.760
professional who needs strong, logical
deduction skills in their daily work.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.910
And how do you solve these problems?

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.590
You solve them using methods like Venn
diagrams or those analytical rules,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.100
all to determine which conclusions
are valid from the premises.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.300
That's your roadmap.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.330
Friends fully worked out examples.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.520
Let's put theory into practice with
some fully worked out examples.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.705
Example, one basic syllogism.

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:06.165
Question statements one.

00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.235
All pens are pencils.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:09.045
Two.

00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:11.355
Some pencils are erasers.

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:15.645
Conclusions A, some pens are erasers.

00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:18.645
B, no pen is an eraser.

00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.855
C. Some erasers are pencils.

00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:24.795
D. All erasers are pens.

00:13:25.215 --> 00:13:28.365
Options a only conclusion a follows.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:37.070
B, only conclusion C follows C, either
A or B follows D. None of the above.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.350
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.640
Step one, understand the
relationships from the statements.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.110
Statement one.

00:13:48.469 --> 00:13:50.209
All pens are pencils.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:56.569
This means the entire set of pens is
nestled inside the set of pencils, like a

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:59.599
small family living inside a bigger house.

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:00.920
Statement two.

00:14:01.219 --> 00:14:02.839
Some pencils are erasers.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:07.805
This means there's an overlap
between pencils and erasers.

00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:14.104
Now, this overlap could be only with the
pencils that are not pens, or it could

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.074
also include some pencils that are pens.

00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:18.905
We don't know for sure.

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:20.255
It's ambiguous.

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:25.204
Step two, evaluate each conclusion
based on these relationships.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.350
Conclusion.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.400
A, some pens are erasers
from our statements.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.920
We know pens are a subset of pencils
and some pencils are erasers.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.140
Is it possible that the pencils that
are erasers also happen to be pens?

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.760
Yes, it's possible.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.400
However, is it a definite certainty?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.420
Not at all.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.250
We can easily imagine a scenario
where the erasers only overlap

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.410
with the pencils that are not pens.

00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:58.405
Since it's not necessarily true
in all valid interpretations, this

00:14:58.405 --> 00:15:03.835
conclusion does not definitely follow
conclusion B, no pen is an eraser.

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:09.325
Now, this conclusion contradicts the
very possibility we identified for

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:14.570
conclusion a. Since it's absolutely
possible for some pens to be erasers

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.520
because the erasers can overlap with
the part of pencils that are also pens.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.870
Stating no pen is an eraser
cannot be necessarily true.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.700
So this conclusion also does not
definitely follow conclusion.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.310
C. Some erasers are pencils.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.380
Ah, this one is straightforward.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.060
Statement two explicitly says
some pencils are erasers.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:44.610
And by the rule of simple conversion for
error type statements, if some a RB, then

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.760
it necessarily follows that some BRA.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.500
Therefore, if some pencils are
erasers, it necessarily follows

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.840
that some erasers are pencils.

00:15:55.165 --> 00:15:58.224
This conclusion definitely follows pka.

00:15:58.555 --> 00:16:01.555
Conclusion D. All erasers are pens.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:06.324
Friends, there is absolutely no
information in our statements that even

00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:08.515
hints at such a strong relationship.

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:14.064
The statements only mention some
overlap between pencils and erasers and

00:16:14.275 --> 00:16:16.765
pens being just a subset of pencils.

00:16:17.094 --> 00:16:19.584
It is clearly not a definite conclusion.

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:24.155
So this conclusion does not
definitely follow step three,

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:26.045
check for either or case.

00:16:26.405 --> 00:16:30.545
Let's look at conclusions A
and B. Do they look familiar?

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:34.745
Yes, they form a complimentary
pair, some and no.

00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:39.334
And they involve the very same
elements, pens and erasers.

00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:45.665
And remember, we individually determined
that both A and B were false, meaning

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.895
they didn't necessarily follow.

00:16:47.564 --> 00:16:52.155
Based on our strict deduction, so
when both conditions for an either or

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:56.865
case are met, then one of them must
be true in this specific scenario.

00:16:57.105 --> 00:17:00.585
Either some pens are erasers
or no pen is an eraser.

00:17:01.215 --> 00:17:03.944
Thus, they form a perfect either or pair.

00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:07.270
Final answer, conclusion,
C definitely follows.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.379
And the pair of conclusions A
and B, they follow an either

00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:14.629
or relation given the options.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.770
If we must pick a single best
definite conclusion, C is the

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.930
only one that is necessarily true.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.950
The correct answer is B,
only conclusion C follows.

00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:26.700
Example two.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.210
Possibility case question statements.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:30.899
One.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.540
Some cars are buses two.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.250
No bus is a truck.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.909
Conclusions A, some trucks are cars.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.430
B, no car is a truck.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.310
C, some cars are not trucks.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.820
D, all cars being trucks is a possibility.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.790
Options a only conclusion.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.600
C follows.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:59.765
B, only conclusion B follows C, both
B and C. Follow D only conclusion C

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:05.825
and D follows Understand the question
before moving to explanation solution.

00:18:06.095 --> 00:18:09.905
Step one, understand the
relationships from the statements.

00:18:10.264 --> 00:18:11.284
Statement one.

00:18:11.554 --> 00:18:13.264
Some cars are buses.

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:17.794
This means there's an overlap,
a common area between the set

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.925
of cars and the set of buses.

00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:22.985
Statement two, no bus is a truck.

00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:25.205
This is a very clear boundary.

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:28.205
Buses and trucks are completely separate.

00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:30.814
They have absolutely no common elements.

00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:32.014
Zero overlap.

00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:36.514
Step two, evaluate each conclusion
based on these relationships.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:37.889
Conclusion.

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:40.080
A, some trucks are cars.

00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:45.060
Now we know some cars are
buses and no bus is a truck.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.929
This immediately tells us that
the portion of cars that are

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:50.820
buses can never be trucks.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.689
However, what about the portion
of cars that are not buses?

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.090
They could very well be
trucks, couldn't they?

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.400
So it is possible for some trucks to be
cars, but is it a definite certainty?

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.030
No.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.620
Therefore, this conclusion does
not necessarily follow conclusion.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:13.020
B, no Car is a truck, as we just
established in the analysis of conclusion.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.880
A, it is indeed possible for
some cars, specifically the ones

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.770
that are not buses to be trucks.

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:24.545
Since this possibility exists, the
definite conclusion, no car is a

00:19:24.545 --> 00:19:27.274
truck cannot be true in all scenarios.

00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:31.745
Therefore, this conclusion does
not definitely follow conclusion.

00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:34.264
C, some cars are not trucks.

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:35.645
Let's break this down.

00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:37.595
Friends from statement one.

00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:39.905
We know some cars are buses.

00:19:40.175 --> 00:19:44.074
And from statement two,
we know no bus is a truck.

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:47.465
Now, if you put these two
together, what do you get?

00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:52.355
It means that the sum cars
that are buses can never, under

00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:54.544
any circumstances be trucks.

00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:57.574
Therefore, there is a
definite portion of cars.

00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:02.165
Those specific cars that are also
buses that are certainly not trucks,

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.115
this conclusion necessarily follows.

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.165
It's a definite truth.

00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:10.185
Conclusion, D. All cars being
trucks is a possibility.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:16.155
We know that some cars are buses from
statement one, and we also know no

00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:18.435
bus is a truck from statement two.

00:20:18.735 --> 00:20:19.814
This is crucial.

00:20:20.084 --> 00:20:24.135
It means the part of cars
that are buses can never under

00:20:24.135 --> 00:20:25.995
any circumstances beat drugs.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.270
If even a small part of cars
cannot be trucks, then how can

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.129
all cars possibly be trucks?

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.629
It's impossible, right?

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:37.290
Therefore, this possibility
simply does not exist.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.870
Final answer, only conclusion.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:40.229
C.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.790
Logically follows the correct
answer is A only conclusion.

00:20:44.969 --> 00:20:52.379
C follows example three only and
only a few question statements.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.620
One, only a few fruits are sweet.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.520
Two.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.640
All sweet are tasty Conclusions,
A, some fruits are tasty.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.310
B, no, fruit is tasty.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.070
C, all fruits can be sweet.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.100
D, some sweet are not fruits.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:17.610
Options A only conclusion
A follows B, both A and D.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:23.130
Follow C. Only conclusion D
follows D, none of the above.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.490
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.350
Solution.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.540
Step one, understand the relationships
from the statements statement

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.180
one, only a few fruits are sweet.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.270
This is a super crucial
statement, my friends.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.180
It implies two very specific things.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.760
First, some fruits are sweet.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.230
Yes, there's definitely an overlap
between fruits and sweet things.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:55.189
Second, some fruits are not sweet and
equally important, there's a portion of

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.709
fruits that is definitively not sweet.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.600
Don't miss this second part.

00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:01.100
Statement two.

00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:03.020
All sweet are tasty.

00:22:03.379 --> 00:22:04.520
This is simpler.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.080
It means the entire set of sweet
things is completely contained

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.639
within the set of tasty Things like
a sweet ladu always being tasty.

00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:18.795
Step two, evaluate each conclusion
based on these relationships.

00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:23.595
Conclusion, A, some fruits
are tasty from statement one.

00:22:23.685 --> 00:22:28.095
We know some fruits are sweet,
and from statement two, we

00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:30.135
know all sweet are tasty.

00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:32.295
Now, let's combine these.

00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:37.815
If some fruits are sweet and all sweet
things are tasty, then it necessarily

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:40.305
follows that some fruits are tasty.

00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:42.615
This conclusion definitely follows.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.790
PKA guarantee.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.940
Conclusion B, no fruit is tasty.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.760
This contradicts inclusion A, which we
just established as definitely following.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.050
Since we know some fruits are
necessarily tasty, it cannot

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.030
be true that no fruit is tasty.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.910
Therefore, this conclusion
does not follow.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.980
Conclusion.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.230
C, all fruits can be sweet.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.870
Remember statement one, it explicitly
states only a few fruits are sweet.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.220
This statement, by its very
definition, inherently means

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.110
that some fruits are not sweet.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.790
If some fruits are definitively
not sweet, then how can it ever be

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.980
possible for all fruits to be sweet?

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.210
It's impossible.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.655
Therefore, this possibility is false.

00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:29.115
Conclusion.

00:23:29.115 --> 00:23:31.545
D, some sweet are not fruits.

00:23:31.935 --> 00:23:34.635
We know only a few fruits are sweet.

00:23:34.965 --> 00:23:37.605
Which tells us about the
relationship of fruits.

00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:38.595
Two sweet things.

00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:43.605
Some fruits are sweet, some are not,
but does it definitively tell us about

00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:45.315
the relationship of sweet things?

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.415
Two fruits, not necessarily.

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:52.065
It is quite possible that all
sweet things are fruits, meaning

00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:56.085
the entire set of sweet could be
a subset of the set of fruits.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.700
If all sweet things are fruits, then
the statements, some sweet are not

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.740
fruits would be false, wouldn't it?

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.960
Since it's not true in all possible
valid interpretations, it could be false.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:12.670
Therefore, this conclusion does not
necessarily follow Final answer,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.580
only conclusion A logically follows.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.050
The correct answer is a
only conclusion a follows.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:20.980
Thank you.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.750
See you in the next lecture.
