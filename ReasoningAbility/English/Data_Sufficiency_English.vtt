00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on data sufficiency.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.200
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.160
This is it.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.430
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.050
All right, my friends.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.330
Let's talk about data sufficiency.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.580
This isn't just any topic.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.259
It's a crucial one in reasoning
ability designed to test your unique

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.240
talent for analyzing given data.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.600
Your main goal here is to figure
out whether the information you

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.890
are given is well sufficient to
answer a particular question.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.629
You'll get a question, right?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.990
And then two or more
statements full of information.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.940
Now, here's the kicker, folks.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.410
Your job is not to solve the
question and find the exact answer.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.430
No, no, no.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.800
Your task is simply to determine if the
information provided in those statements,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.590
either on their own or when joined forces.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.770
Is enough to find that answer.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.880
It's like being a detective, but
instead of catching the culprit,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.900
you are figuring out if you have
enough clues to identify them.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.480
This concept truly sharpens your logical
reasoning, analytical skills, and your

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.580
understanding of various quantitative and
reasoning concepts, all without making

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.650
you do the heavy calculation lifting.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.910
Isn't that a relief?

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.910
Real world relevance.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.450
Now, why is data sufficiency so important?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.500
Think about it.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.660
Friends, this skill is like your secret
weapon for making informed decisions by

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.270
evaluating all the available information.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.550
Imagine your inner banking role.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.470
This skill becomes absolutely vital
for quickly assessing financial data,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.475
understanding customer profiles,
or even spotting market trends.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.430
It helps you make sound judgements
and solve problems super efficiently.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.120
It's like having a superpower
for quick accurate assessment.

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:59.445
Breakdown of question types based on
the patterns we've seen in your exams.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:03.375
Data sufficiency questions
frequently cover a few key topics.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:07.035
We are talking about order and
ranking, which usually makes

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:09.044
up about 20% of the questions.

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:13.395
Then there's blood relations
coming in at a solid 15%.

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.480
Coding decoding also takes up about 15%.

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:22.215
Directions and distances, that's about
10% seating arrangement and puzzles.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:27.945
The big ones often account for a
good 20% inequalities are around 10%.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.685
And finally we have other miscellaneous
topics like age on numbers,

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.785
which make up the remaining 10%.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:38.925
So you see it's a mixed bag,
but each topic has its place.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.775
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:46.695
Now, for the part, everyone asks
about formulas, and here's the funny

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:50.775
truth, friends, there are no specific
formulas for data sufficiency.

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:51.675
Surprised.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:54.795
It's more about logic
than rote memorization.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.070
Instead, you need to focus on these
fundamental, logical principles and clever

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.040
tricks First, and this is super important,
don't solve just check sufficiency.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.480
Your ultimate goal is not to find
the answer itself, but simply to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.970
determine if that answer can be found.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.510
Don't waste precious time
calculating the exact value.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.310
Just see if it's possible.

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:21.275
Second, analyze statements individually.

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:24.545
First, always, always
check statement one alone.

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:25.715
See if it works.

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:30.095
Then completely ignore statement
one and check statement two alone.

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:32.765
Only after that do you combine them.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.635
It's like checking two separate
clues before trying to connect them.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.790
Third, assume nothing.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.660
Please, my friends, use only
the information given in the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.220
question and the statements.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.630
Do not, I repeat.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.230
Do not bring in outside
knowledge or your uncle's wisdom.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.520
Stick to the script.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.190
Fourth, look for unique solutions.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.030
If a statement or a combination
of statements leads to multiple

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.130
possible answers, then guess what?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.870
It is not sufficient.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.070
We need one definite answer,
not a menu of possibilities.

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:11.315
Fifth combined judiciously only, and I
mean only combined statements if neither

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:12.995
of them was sufficient on its own.

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:16.985
Don't rush to mix everything
together like a complicated curry.

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:21.005
And finally, a great trick
test with counter examples.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:26.135
If you think a statement is sufficient,
quickly try to imagine a scenario where

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:28.025
it might lead to a different answer.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.995
If you can find such
a scenario, then poof.

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:32.255
It's not sufficient.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.355
It's like a quick reality check.

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:36.645
Methods of solving.

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:40.935
Alright, let's get into the
step-by-step method to tackle

00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.825
these data sufficiency problems.

00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:44.895
It's a systematic approach.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.145
Just like preparing your favorite chai.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:49.725
First, read the question carefully.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:53.794
Understand exactly what
information is being asked for.

00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:58.025
Identify the key variables or
conditions you need to uncover.

00:04:58.385 --> 00:04:59.525
Don't be in a hurry.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.645
Second, evaluate statement one alone.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.344
Assume only statement one is true.

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:09.094
Try to answer the question
using only this information.

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:13.565
If you can find a definite unique
answer, then congratulations.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.990
Statement one alone is sufficient.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.760
If you can't find a definite answer
or you find multiple answers, then

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.280
statement one alone is not sufficient.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.330
Simple, right.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.180
Third, evaluate statement two alone.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.930
Now completely ignore what
you found for statement one.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.540
Assume only statement two is true.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.260
Try to answer the question
using only this information.

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:41.835
Again, if you can find a definite
unique answer, then statement

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:43.245
two alone is sufficient.

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:47.055
If not, then statement two
alone is not sufficient.

00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:48.854
See how we're isolating them.

00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:53.354
Fourth, evaluate statements
one and two together if needed.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.710
This step is only for when neither
statement one nor statement

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.300
two alone was sufficient.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.780
Now, combine the information
from both statements.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.440
See if the question can be
answered uniquely using both.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.150
If you can find a definite unique
answer by combining them, then both

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.070
statements together are sufficient.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.970
But if even after combining
them, you still can't find a

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.980
definite answer, then guess what?

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.100
Both statements together
are still not sufficient.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:26.085
Fifth, evaluate if data
is insufficient from both.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.405
Yes, my friends.

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:31.635
In some cases, even when you bring
both statements together, like long

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:35.835
lost siblings, the data might just
not be enough to answer the question.

00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:36.945
It happens.

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:39.434
And finally, mark your answer.

00:06:39.794 --> 00:06:43.275
Based on your thorough analysis,
select the appropriate option.

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:45.945
It could be statement
one, alone is sufficient.

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:47.835
Statement two alone is sufficient.

00:06:48.044 --> 00:06:49.575
Both together are sufficient.

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:54.615
Either is sufficient, meaning one or
two works independently or neither is

00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:57.645
sufficient shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:02.085
Now for some clever shortcuts and
smart techniques to make your life

00:07:02.115 --> 00:07:05.175
easier, first, eliminate options early.

00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:08.594
This is a classic move,
like a strategic chess play.

00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:12.855
As soon as you figure out if statement
one is sufficient or not, you can

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.925
immediately eliminate some options.

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:16.875
For instance, if statement one.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.900
Is sufficient.

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:22.099
You can often rule out options like
statement two alone is sufficient,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.179
or both together are sufficient
unless, of course, either is an

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.609
option, it saves you precious time.

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:33.260
Second, visual representation for
topics like seating arrangement,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.059
directions, or blood relations.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.770
Don't just stare at the words.

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:41.865
Draw diagrams, a quick sketch can
help you visualize the information and

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:44.085
assess sufficiency almost instantly.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:46.305
Third, focus on constraints.

00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:50.775
Always identify the critical constraints
in the question or statements.

00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:55.935
These little nuggets of information might
just be the key to limiting possibilities

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:58.275
and leading you to that unique solution.

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.165
Fourth, practice recognition.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.790
The more you practice, the smarter
you get with enough practice, you'll

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.930
start recognizing common patterns
where certain types of information are

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.150
typically sufficient or insufficient.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.760
It's like developing a sixth sense
for data and finally manage time.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.020
This is crucial.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.370
Remember, don't spend too much time
trying to calculate exact answers.

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:26.909
A quick mental check or a rough
calculation is usually more than

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:28.500
enough to determine sufficiency.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.610
Time is money, my friends, common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:34.094
All right.

00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:37.784
Let's talk about the pitfalls,
the potholes on the road to

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:39.344
data sufficiency mastery.

00:08:39.824 --> 00:08:41.204
Avoid these my friends.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:45.375
The absolute most common
mistake is solving the question.

00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:51.104
Yes, you heard me trying to find the
actual answer instead of just checking if

00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:53.805
it can be found is a total time-waster.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.069
Resist the urge.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.569
Second combining statements prematurely.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.480
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.350
Do not combine statements before
checking each one individually.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.010
It's like trying to mix
all the ingredients before

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.750
checking if each one is fresh.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.630
Third, using outside information.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.580
This is a big no-no.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.930
Relying on general knowledge or
assumptions not provided in the

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.390
problem is a recipe for disaster.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:23.740
Stick to the script.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.220
Remember.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.640
Fourth, missing ambiguity.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.830
Failing to realize that a statement or
a combination might lead to more than

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.380
one possible answer is a common error.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.110
If it's ambiguous, it's insufficient.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.730
Fifth, not considering all cases.

00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:43.075
Especially for either or scenarios.

00:09:43.255 --> 00:09:48.085
Make sure you check if both possibilities
lead to the same definitive answer.

00:09:48.475 --> 00:09:51.895
If they lead to different
answers, then it's not sufficient.

00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:57.175
And lastly, logical flaws incorrectly
inferring relationships or

00:09:57.175 --> 00:09:59.125
conclusions from the given data.

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.360
Always double check
your logic, my friends.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.730
WH framework summary.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.280
Let's quickly summarize this whole concept
using our trusty WH framework, shall we?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.800
So, what is data sufficiency?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.189
It's about determining if
the given information is

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:18.750
enough to answer a question.

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:20.300
Why do we bother with it?

00:10:20.689 --> 00:10:21.829
Why is it important?

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:26.420
It's to assess your analytical and
logical reasoning skills, which

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.219
are crucial for decision making.

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:29.839
When do we apply this?

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.520
It's applied when evaluating data
to reach conclusions, especially

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:36.170
in problem solving scenarios.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:37.645
Where is it relevant?

00:10:37.885 --> 00:10:39.175
Oh, it's everywhere.

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:44.125
Relevant in your exams, in business
analysis, research, and truly in

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:45.835
your daily decision making too.

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:47.575
Who needs to master this?

00:10:47.845 --> 00:10:51.835
Friends, analysts, managers,
and basically anyone needing

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:53.545
to make data-driven judgments.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.105
And how do you do it?

00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:59.185
By systematically analyzing
individual statements and then

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:02.965
their combination all to check for
the uniqueness of the solution.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:04.555
Clear as daylight, right?

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.610
Fully worked out examples.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.800
Now for some practical application, let's
look at a few fully worked out examples.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.765
This is where the rubber meets the road.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.760
Example, one order and ranking question.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.220
What is the rank of Raul from the top?

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:29.700
In a class of 50 friends statements,
one raul's rank from the bottom is 32.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.569
Raul's rank is five ranks
below the topper options.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.960
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.210
B. Statement two alone is sufficient to
answer the question C. Either statement,

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.605
one alone or statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:11:46.185 --> 00:11:50.715
D both statement one and statement
two together are not sufficient to

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:54.405
answer the question, understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.720
Step-by-step solution.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.180
Step one, analyze statement One.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.710
Alone, we have the total number
of friends, which is 50 Raul's.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.990
Rank from the bottom is given as 30.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:12.000
Now there's a classic formula for
this rank from top, plus rank from

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.730
bottom minus one equals total friends.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:21.660
Let's say raul's rank from the top is
X, so x plus 30 minus one equals 50.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.839
That simplifies to x plus 29 equals 50.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.790
Doing the math X equals 50
minus 29, which gives us 21.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.470
Since we can find a unique rank
for Rahul from the top, it's 21.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.470
Statement one alone is
absolutely sufficient.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.439
Step two, analyze statement two alone.

00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:45.705
This statement says, Raul's rank
is five ranks below the topper.

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:48.825
Well, the topper's rank
is always one, isn't it?

00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:53.955
So raul's rank from the top would
be one plus five, which equals six.

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:58.155
Since we can find a unique rank
for Raul from the top, it's six.

00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:00.585
Statement two alone is also sufficient.

00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:03.705
Step three, combine statement one and two.

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:07.365
Actually, my friends, we don't
even need to combine them here.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.010
Why?

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.990
Because both statement one and statement
two individually lead to a unique answer.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.170
So either one of them is
sufficient on its own.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:21.570
The correct answer is C. Either statement,
one alone or statement two alone is

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.250
sufficient to answer the question.

00:13:24.675 --> 00:13:28.275
Example two blood relations question.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:32.355
How is P related to Q statements?

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:38.415
One, R is the brother of p
and s is the daughter of Q2.

00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:43.855
T is the mother of q and s is
the daughter of t. Options.

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:48.505
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:53.125
B. Statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:58.585
C. Both statement one and statement
two together are sufficient

00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.685
to answer the question D.

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:05.365
Both statement one and statement
two together are not sufficient

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:06.145
to answer the question.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:12.920
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, step-by-step solution.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.339
Step one, analyze statement one alone.

00:14:16.849 --> 00:14:23.180
From this statement, we know R is the
brother of P, but wait, P is gender isn't

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.030
known, is it could be male or female.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:31.910
Then it says S is the daughter of
Q. Again, Q's, gender is unknown.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.910
And the big question is, is
there any connection between

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.860
P and Q established here?

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.790
Nope.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.520
So from statement one alone, we
absolutely cannot determine how P

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:47.219
is related to Q. Not sufficient.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.550
Step two, analyze statement two alone.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.120
This statement tells us
T is the mother of Q.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.090
Again, Q's gender remains a mystery.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.490
Then S is the daughter of
T. Okay, so we know T is Q's

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.890
mother and S is T's daughter.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.190
This means S is either Q sister.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.510
If Q is male.

00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:15.705
Or S is Q's daughter if Q is
female, and T is also S'S mother.

00:15:16.035 --> 00:15:19.905
But the crucial bit, the
direct relationship between P

00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:22.125
and Q still not established.

00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:25.875
So statement two alone
is also not sufficient.

00:15:26.295 --> 00:15:29.325
Step three, combine statement one and two.

00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:34.695
Let's put on our detective hats and
combine the clues from statement one.

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:40.725
We have R is the brother of P, and S is
the daughter of Q from statement two.

00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:46.725
T is the mother of q and S is the
daughter of T. Now, combining these

00:15:47.055 --> 00:15:52.515
S is the daughter of Q from one,
and S is the daughter of T from two.

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.825
This immediately tells us that.

00:15:54.875 --> 00:16:01.295
T is the mother of s and Q is either
the father or the mother of S. Since

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:07.415
statement two also says T is the mother
of q and S is the daughter of Q. This

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:13.355
means Q is also a parent of S. This
effectively makes S the granddaughter

00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:16.295
of T, but hold on a minute, my friends.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.420
Is P'S relationship to Q?

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.870
Clear.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.150
P'S Gender is still unknown.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:27.840
We know RSPs brother, but there's no
link, absolutely no connection provided

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.610
that directly connects p or R to Q.
Even after combining everything we

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:39.310
know, we still cannot establish a clear,
unique relationship between P and Q.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:45.490
The correct answer is D, both statement
one and statement two together are

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.650
not sufficient to answer the question.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.285
Example three time and work.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:56.245
Question, how many days will a and
B take to complete a work together?

00:16:56.575 --> 00:16:58.225
Statements one.

00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:01.435
A alone can complete the work in 10 days.

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:02.275
Two.

00:17:02.515 --> 00:17:06.895
B alone can complete the
work in 15 days options.

00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:11.275
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:16.530
B. Statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question C.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.360
Both statement one and statement two
together are sufficient to answer

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.940
the question D. Both statement one
and statement two together are not

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.710
sufficient to answer the question.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.960
Understand the question before moving
to explanation Step-by-step solution.

00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:37.645
Step one, analyze statement one alone.

00:17:38.064 --> 00:17:42.685
This statement tells us that A alone
can complete the work in 10 days.

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:43.945
Fantastic.

00:17:44.155 --> 00:17:49.014
We know a's individual work rate,
however, to find out how long A

00:17:49.014 --> 00:17:53.754
and b together, we desperately need
information about B'S work rate.

00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:55.915
Since we have no such info.

00:17:56.004 --> 00:17:59.365
Statement, one alone is
definitely not sufficient.

00:17:59.814 --> 00:18:02.514
Step two, analyze statement two alone.

00:18:02.905 --> 00:18:03.655
Similarly.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:08.445
This statement gives us, B alone
can complete the work in 15 days.

00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:09.165
Great.

00:18:09.345 --> 00:18:12.465
We know B'S individual
work rate, but guess what?

00:18:12.764 --> 00:18:16.485
To find out how long they take
together, we need a's work

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:18.074
rate, which is missing here.

00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:22.034
Therefore, statement two
alone is also not sufficient.

00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:25.245
Step three, combine statement one and two.

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:26.235
All right.

00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:29.270
Time to combine forces from statement one.

00:18:29.784 --> 00:18:35.155
A's one day's work is one by 10 of the
total work from statement two B's one

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:37.825
day's work is one by 15 of the total work.

00:18:38.155 --> 00:18:42.235
Now, if they work together, their
combined one day's work will

00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:45.145
be one by 10 plus one by 15.

00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:46.495
Let's do the math.

00:18:46.735 --> 00:18:51.895
Find a common denominator,
which is 30, so three by 30 plus

00:18:51.985 --> 00:18:54.865
two by 30 equals five by 30.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.805
This simplifies to one by six of the work.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:02.665
If A and B together can complete
one by six of the work in one day,

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:07.315
it logically follows that they will
complete the whole work in six days.

00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:12.145
Since we can find a definite unique
answer by combining both statements,

00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:14.755
they are indeed sufficient together.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:21.530
Tara, the correct answer is see both
statement one and statement two together

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:23.689
are sufficient to answer the question.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.679
Thank you.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.074
See you in the next lecture.
