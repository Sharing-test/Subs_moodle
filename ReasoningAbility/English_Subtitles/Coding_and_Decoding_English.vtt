00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on coding decoding.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.330
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.470
So coding, decoding, it's
like a secret language, right?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.230
You take a message, turn it into a
secret code that's coding, then you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
take that secret code and convert
it back to its original form.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.010
That's decoding simple, isn't it?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.645
This whole topic is basically
checking your brain super.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.450
Power.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.150
Can you find the hidden rule or pattern?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.750
And once you find it, can
you use it for new words?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.450
It's all about logical thinking, keeping
your eyes peel like a hawk, and of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.210
course, knowing your ABCs inside out.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.190
Real world relevance.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.160
Now, why should you care
about this, my friend?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.129
Imagine you become a
big officer in the bank.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:58.735
You'll be looking at encrypted financial
data, transaction codes, and all

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.745
sorts of confidential information.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:05.995
If you are good at coding decoding, you
can quickly crack those complex patterns.

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:10.765
This means accuracy, security,
and catching fraud like a pro.

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:14.155
Think of it as your secret
weapon in the banking world.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:18.835
Breakdown of question types
based on past reasoning ability,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.380
exam patterns for your exam.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.160
These are the typical questions
you'll face in coding decoding.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.860
First up, we have letter coding.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.850
This is your bread and butter,
the most common type occurring

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.979
with a 30 40% frequency.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.619
Here, letters of a word are replaced by
other letters following a special rule.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
This rule could be simple shifting
letters forward or backward in the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.210
alphabet, or it could be a bit sneaky.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:50.675
Skipping letters or even using
those cool opposite letters, you

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.675
know, A for Z, B for Y, like that.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.855
Next comes number slash symbol coding.

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:02.855
This one pops up about 20, 25% of the
time words are turned into numbers.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.955
Or symbols are sometimes a mix of both.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.475
The code might be based on alphabetical
position A is one, B is two.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:13.815
All the way to Z is 26.

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:19.695
Or it could be the sum of those positions
or even a direct straightforward mapping

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.335
of letters to specific numbers or symbols.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.065
No rocket science, just observation.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.269
Then we have the famous mixed coding,
sometimes called Chinese coding.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.390
This one has a frequency of 20, 30%.

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.920
In this type, you'll get a few
sentences with words and their coded

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
forms, which can be quite a mix of
numbers, symbols, or different words.

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.940
Your job is to play detective comparing
multiple statements where some words

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.404
and their codes overlap to figure out
what each individual word stands for.

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:54.465
It's like solving a puzzle.

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:55.785
Quite fun actually.

00:02:56.234 --> 00:03:01.424
After that, we have substitution
coding appearing 10 to 15% of the time.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.945
This is where things get a bit playful.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:08.204
They'll tell you something like
if white is called blue, and

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.305
blue is called red, and so on.

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:14.485
Then they ask a question based
on this chain of substitutions.

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:19.255
Your main task is to stick to the
chain given and not overthink it.

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.485
Finally, the niche, one,
condition-based coding showing

00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:25.735
up only five to 10% of the time.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.940
Here they give you a set of numbers.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.810
Letters or symbols, along with specific
conditions for how to code them.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.270
You just have to apply these conditions
one by one to decode the given sequence.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.170
It's like following a
recipe, formulas and tricks.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.990
Now for the GaN part, the formulas and
tricks that will make your life easier.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.859
First alphabetical positions forward.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.230
You must memorize these my friend.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.380
A is one, B is two, C is three.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.630
All the way to Z is 26.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
A super handy trick here is the E JT rule.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.810
E is five, J is 10, O
is 15, T is 20, Y is 25.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.660
This rule is like a quick mental bookmark.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.430
Use it for quick reference.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.650
Then we have alphabetical
positions reverse.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.990
Sometimes the code goes backwards.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.230
Z is one, Y is two, X is three.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.360
All the way to A is 26.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.620
Get familiar with this too, and
don't forget your opposite letters.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.390
These are super important.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.450
Remember them with little mnemonics,
A Z like Azad, BY, like by.

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.960
CX like crux, DW like dw,
EV, like even FU like fun.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.120
Gt like gt road.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.250
HS like high school.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.650
Ir like Indian railways.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.940
JQ like jack, K, p like kur,
LO like love, MN like man.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.290
A quick tip here.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.460
The sum of positions of
opposite letters is always 27.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.590
For example, A one plus Z 26 equals 27.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.790
Isn't that neat?

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.750
Now, let's look at some common
coding patterns you'll encounter.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.650
Shifting.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.330
This is when letters are simply shifted
by a fixed number of positions, either

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.150
forward plus N or backward minus n
alternating shift a slightly more.

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.724
Complex cousin, where letters
are shifted by different values,

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:33.515
perhaps plus N, then minus M, then
plus B, and so on, reverse order.

00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:34.625
Super simple.

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:38.645
The entire word is just written
backwards, opposite letters.

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:43.835
Each letter is replaced by its opposite
letter, W slash consonant specific.

00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:46.145
This is where things get interesting.

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:48.034
Vowels might follow one rule.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.280
While consonants follow another grouping
slash swapping letters within a word

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.979
might be swapped in pairs or small groups.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.460
Number value letters are
directly converted to their

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.200
numerical positional values.

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:03.179
Methods of solving.

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.000
All right, let's talk strategy.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.780
How do you actually solve these?

00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:12.275
Analyze the given code first step one.

00:06:12.604 --> 00:06:16.445
Always identify your
input and output clearly.

00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:20.044
Write down the original word
or message and it's coded form.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.335
No confusion there.

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:24.724
Then step two for letter coding.

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.515
Examine the letter to
letter correspondence.

00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:32.405
Compare each letter of the original
word with its counterpart in the code.

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:36.185
Next step three, check
for positional changes.

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:39.455
Note if letters moved forward or backward.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:45.365
You can even write down the numerical
shift, like A to B is plus one or A

00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:51.820
to Z. Could be minus one or even plus
25 if you cycle around after that.

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:54.665
Step four, look for fixed patterns.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.310
See if the shift is the same for every
letter or if it alternates, like plus

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.220
one, then minus one, then plus one again.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.110
Then step five, check for
opposite letters or reverse order.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.880
Is it simply the opposite letter, or
is the word just spelled backward?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.220
Finally, step six.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.650
If numbers or symbols are involved,
consider number symbol mapping check

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.450
if they correspond to alphabetical
positions, counts, or perhaps a direct

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.660
substitution for mixed Chinese coding.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.040
It's a systematic approach.

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:35.885
First step one, write down all the
given statements and their coded forms.

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:37.145
Don't skip this.

00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:39.035
It helps organize your thoughts.

00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:42.785
Then step two, identify common words.

00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:46.385
Look for words that pop up
in more than one sentence.

00:07:46.785 --> 00:07:47.955
Simultaneously.

00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:50.745
Step three, identify common codes.

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:54.225
Check for codes that appear
in the corresponding coded

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.875
forms of those sentences.

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:59.655
Next step four, eliminate and isolate.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:04.845
By comparing sentences, you can eliminate
the common words and their codes.

00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:10.125
Whatever remains unique in a sentence will
correspond to the remaining unique code.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.130
And finally, step five, deduce all codes.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.760
Keep repeating this process
until you figured out the code.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.610
For every unique word, patience is key.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.420
Here, my friend.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.810
For substitution coding,
it's a bit different.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.130
First step one, understand
the chain of substitutions.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.470
Note down the sequence carefully.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.560
Like A is called B. B is called
C. C is called D. Then step.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.710
Two, identify the target.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.650
What exactly is the question asking for?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.410
For example, what is a dog called?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.310
And finally, step three,
trace the substitution.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.180
Find the original term in your
substitution chain, and then

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.920
just locate what it is called.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.120
If dog is called cat, then
the answer is simply cat.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.970
Don't go beyond that direct substitution.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.280
All right, no extra GaN needed.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:06.715
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:11.965
All right, my friend time for some
jugar, some clever shortcuts and smart

00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:14.185
techniques to save you precious time.

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:17.395
First memorize alphabetical positions.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:21.115
Seriously, knowing both
forward and reverse positions

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:23.215
instantly is a huge time saver.

00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:27.940
Practice writing them down quickly,
perhaps two, three times before your exam.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.100
It really helps.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:33.565
Keep an opposite letter stable,
either mentally or quickly

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:37.015
jotted down A to ZBY, and so on.

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.265
This will cut down your thinking time.

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:43.285
Try pattern visualization
instead of meticulously

00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:44.995
writing out every single step.

00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:48.265
Try to mentally visualize
the shifts or patterns.

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:50.125
It's like a mental shortcut.

00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:53.185
Always check first and last letters.

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:57.410
Often the pattern for the first
and last letters gives you a

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.300
big hint about the overall code.

00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:01.069
It's a good starting point.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.660
Sometimes the code might relate
to the count letters or numbers.

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:10.699
It could be the number of letters in a
word or even the sum of their positions.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.050
Don't overlook these simpler patterns
for multiple choice questions.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.479
Always use the process of elimination.

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:21.785
If you can deduce even a small
part of the code, use it to

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:23.375
knock out incorrect options.

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:24.665
Smart, isn't it?

00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:29.645
In more complex letter coding,
look for VL or consonant patterns.

00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:34.175
Sometimes VLS and consonants
follow completely different rules,

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:36.005
so keep an eye out for that.

00:10:36.475 --> 00:10:38.755
And always focus on change.

00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:43.615
When you compare the original word and
its code, don't just see what's there.

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:46.944
Pay attention to what
changed and how it changed.

00:10:47.155 --> 00:10:51.535
That's where the secret lies,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.340
Now let's talk about the pitfalls.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.650
The places where most friends stumble.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.330
Avoid these, my friend.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.420
First, incorrect alphabetical counting.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.160
This is a classic miscalculating
shifts like treating A to

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.230
Z to A as a plus one shift.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.770
Remember, the alphabet wraps around
A to Z could be minus one or plus 25.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.720
Be careful with those jumps.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.110
Then mixing forward and reverse positions.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.939
You might use forward positions
when reverse is needed or vice versa

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.040
without even realizing the pattern.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.120
Stay alert.

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:31.660
Many friends tend to
overcomplicate simple patterns.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.709
Sometimes the code is just
super straightforward, a simple

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:37.780
reverse, or a constant shift.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.469
Don't go looking for overly
complex rules unnecessarily.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.060
Keep it simple, silly.

00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:46.305
A big one is missing alternating patterns.

00:11:46.694 --> 00:11:51.915
Failing to identify if the shift or rule
alternates for odd or even positions

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:53.985
or for different types of letters.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:59.145
These patterns can be a bit sneaky
and in errors in mixed coding.

00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:03.915
It's easy to get confused when comparing
multiple statements in Chinese coding.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.189
This often leads to
incorrect isolation of codes.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.170
Take it one step at a time.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.730
Compare systematically, and please,
please, please don't make the

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.830
mistake of ignoring the question.

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:19.640
You might decode everything
correctly, but then answer the

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.020
wrong part of the question.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.860
For example, you decode for
bright when the question asked

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.290
for dark, read the question twice.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.120
Finally, applying rule
inconsistently once you found a rule.

00:12:32.324 --> 00:12:36.165
Apply it strictly to all letters
or numbers of the target word.

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:37.454
Don't change your mind.

00:12:37.454 --> 00:12:37.995
Halfway.

00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:40.125
WH Framework summary.

00:12:40.484 --> 00:12:44.265
Let's quickly summarize this
concept using our WH framework.

00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:46.875
So what is coding decoding?

00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:51.555
It's a clever process of transforming
messages into secret codes and

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.385
then converting them back again.

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:54.944
Why do we study it?

00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:57.734
Well, it tests your logical reasoning.

00:12:57.825 --> 00:13:03.285
Analytical skills and your ability to
spot patterns all crucial for your exam.

00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:04.875
When is it applied?

00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:09.915
It's used in scenarios that need
encryption, decryption, and generally

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:12.465
problem solving based on predefined rules.

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.085
Where does it come up?

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:17.385
It's a core topic in the
reasoning ability, sections of

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:21.165
competitive exams, especially
for banking and government jobs.

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:22.705
Very important for you.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:24.625
Who needs to understand this?

00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:27.265
Friends preparing for competitive exams.

00:13:27.445 --> 00:13:31.465
Intelligence analysts may be
your future calling and anyone

00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:33.205
who needs to decipher patterns.

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.245
And how do you crack it?

00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:39.985
By identifying the hidden rule,
whether it's a shift, a substitution,

00:13:40.075 --> 00:13:44.335
or position based between the
original and coded forms, and then

00:13:44.395 --> 00:13:46.735
applying that rule, simple as that.

00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:48.445
Fully worked out.

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:49.225
Examples.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.020
All right my friend.

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:55.610
Let's get down to some real
with fully worked out examples.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.770
Example, one letter coding,
fixed shift question.

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:03.860
In a certain code language
teacher is coded as.

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:11.005
V-G-C-E-J-G-T how will student
be coded in the same language?

00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:23.755
A-U-V-W-F-G-P-V-B-U-R-W-G-E
P-U-C-T-V-W-F-G-P-U-D-R-U-V-E-H-G-V

00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:27.205
understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.650
Solution.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:35.400
Step one, analyze the pattern
between teacher and V-G-C-E-J-G-T.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.390
Let's look at the position of each
letter in the alphabet and its

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.740
coded counterpart, T 22, V 22.

00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:44.675
Plus two.

00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:55.595
E five to G seven plus two, A one to
C, three plus two C3 to E five plus two

00:14:55.925 --> 00:15:06.245
H eight to J 10 plus two, E five to G
seven plus two R 18 to T 20 plus two.

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:09.185
Step two, identify the coding rule.

00:15:09.455 --> 00:15:10.085
Aha.

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:12.575
The consistent pattern,
my friend, is that.

00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:16.745
Each letter in the original word
is shifted forward by exactly

00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:21.064
two positions in the alphabet to
get its coded letter Easy peasy.

00:15:21.365 --> 00:15:28.265
Step three, apply the same rule to
student S 19 two s plus two equals

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:39.350
U. 20 1D, 20 2D plus two equals V
22 U 21, 2 U plus two equals W 20

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:48.470
3D four 2D plus two equals F six, E
five, two E plus two equals G seven.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:58.200
N 14 two N plus two equals P
16 T 22 T plus two equals V 22.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.060
Step four, combine the coded
letters so student will be coded

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:12.270
as U-V-W-F-G-P-V, correct answer is
A-U-V-W-F-G-P-V example, two number

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.030
symbol coding, positional value and sum.

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:17.715
Question in a certain code language.

00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:25.185
If bat is coded as 20 and gat is
coded as 24, then how will MAT

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:26.925
be coded in the same language?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:32.625
A 28 B 26 C 30 D 34?

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:36.615
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.420
Step one, analyze the
pattern for bat coded as 20.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.240
Let's first find the
alphabetical positions of

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.130
letters in BAT B two A one T 20.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.900
The sum of positions is two
plus one plus 20 equals 23.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.410
Hmm.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.880
This is not 20.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.530
Something's a bit off here.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.030
Let's see if there's
a slight modification.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.690
Perhaps only the last letters
value is taken, or maybe

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.310
the sum of specific letters.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.839
If we consider bat
coded as 20 and T is 20.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.599
If we consider cat coded as 24
and T is still 20, this makes us

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.440
think the code might be related
to the last letters position, but

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.360
modified by the other letters.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.120
Now, let's assume the code is
simply the sum of alphabetical

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.830
positions like we tried.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:32.170
If the sum is 23 for bat, but the code
is 20, the difference is minus three.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.600
Let's check CAT using the sum idea.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.140
C3 A one T 20.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.070
Sum of positions three
plus one plus 20 equals 24.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.700
Wow.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.730
This matches the given code 24 perfectly.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.430
Step two, identify the coding rule.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.210
Aha.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.340
The rule is crystal clear, my friend.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.870
The code for a word is the sum of
alphabetical positions of all its letters.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.220
Simple, wasn't it?

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.250
We just had to check the
second example to confirm.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.490
Step three, apply the same rule to MAT.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:10.900
Let's find the alphabetical positions
of letters in MATM 13 A one T 20.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.550
The sum of positions is 13
plus one plus 20 equals 34.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.710
Step four, combine the result.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.610
So MAT will be coded as
34, correct Answer is D 34.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.900
Example three mixed coding,
Chinese coding question.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.580
In a certain code language,
paid sunna means you are good.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.790
Sue Casa means good and bad.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.575
Na pay means they are friends.

00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:44.575
Which of the following means friends
in that code language A, NA B, the

00:18:44.695 --> 00:18:51.355
C, pay D two understand the question
before moving to explanation solution.

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:54.745
Step one, write down all
the given statements and

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:56.485
their coded forms statement.

00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:57.685
One page soon.

00:18:57.685 --> 00:18:58.735
Na equals.

00:18:58.825 --> 00:18:59.580
You are good.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:00.975
Statement two.

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:01.514
Two.

00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:05.294
Casa equals good and bad statement three.

00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:08.475
Na pay equals they are friends.

00:19:08.745 --> 00:19:12.314
Step two, compare statement
one and statement two to

00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:14.175
find common words and codes.

00:19:14.475 --> 00:19:15.465
Look closely my friend.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.979
The common word between statement
one and statement two is good.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:26.310
The common code between statement one and
statement two is Sue, so good equals sue.

00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:27.479
Easy deduction.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.290
Step three, compare statement
one and statement three to

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.090
find common words and codes.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.300
Now, let's compare statement
one and statement three.

00:19:36.685 --> 00:19:40.615
The common word between statement
one and statement three is R.

00:19:40.885 --> 00:19:44.665
The common code between statement
one and statement three is pay.

00:19:44.814 --> 00:19:48.774
So R equals pay another
one down, step four.

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:51.054
Now we need the code for friends.

00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:52.585
Look at statement three.

00:19:52.794 --> 00:19:57.024
Statement three says, ADA
pay equals they are friends.

00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:58.314
We already know.

00:19:58.465 --> 00:19:59.605
R equals pay.

00:19:59.845 --> 00:20:02.995
Now let's substitute pay
for R in statement three.

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:03.895
Nada.

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:05.665
Equals they friends.

00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:06.685
Step five.

00:20:06.865 --> 00:20:11.455
To find friends, we need to isolate
the, we don't have enough information

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:16.794
to isolate the specifically from friends
by comparing just these two, but we

00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:21.415
can definitely see the remaining words
and codes from statement three after

00:20:21.415 --> 00:20:23.760
removing R, which is pay remaining words.

00:20:24.385 --> 00:20:30.054
They and friends Remaining codes are
na and the now we need to check if

00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:34.375
NA or the appeared somewhere else to
figure this out, let's look at Na.

00:20:34.584 --> 00:20:36.235
Na appears in statement one.

00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:39.024
Paid sue na equals you are good.

00:20:39.294 --> 00:20:42.715
Since we already reduced that,
pay is r and sue is good.

00:20:42.865 --> 00:20:45.594
Then by elimination na must mean you.

00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:47.455
So na equals you.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.520
Step six.

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:50.379
Now go back to statement three.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.639
Statement three was na, the
pay equals they are friends.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:21:00.280
We know na equals you pay equals R.
Substituting these back into statement

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.790
three, you the R equals they are friends.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.600
This clearly implies that
the must be equal to friends.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.889
Mystery solved correct
answer is be the thank you.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.600
See you in the next lecture.
