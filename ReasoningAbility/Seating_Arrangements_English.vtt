00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on seating arrangement.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.740
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.360
This is it.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.400
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.649
All right, my friend.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.200
Let's dive into seating arrangement.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.110
What exactly is this fancy term?

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.689
Well, it's a type of puzzle, a bit
like musical chairs, but for your

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.545
brain where you get a bunch of
conditions or clues your mission.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.020
Should you choose to accept it is
to arrange people or objects in a

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.570
specific order or configuration.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.720
Think straight lines, fancy circles,
perfect squares, grand rectangles, or

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.300
even other quirky geometric shapes.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.255
The ultimate goal, my dear friend.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.120
Is to pinpoint the exact spot for
each person or object based on the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.970
relationships given in those clever clues.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.450
This whole topic, you see is a fantastic
test of your T ability to think logically,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.700
understand spatial relationships
like who's next to whom or across the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.250
table, and to systematically deduce
information from bits and pieces of data.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.240
It's like being a detective,
but for seating charts.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.700
Real world relevance.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.464
Now why bother with
all this brain jamming?

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.265
You ask, ah, my friend.

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.554
Seating arrangement isn't just
for your exam, it's everywhere.

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:31.425
In the real world.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:33.675
Imagine team formation.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:39.554
You want to arrange your project teams for
optimal collaboration, ensuring all your

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:44.804
key members are strategically placed so
they don't end up talking past each other.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:47.955
It's about teamwork, not just seat work.

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:50.054
Then there's meeting set up.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:54.824
Ever been in a boardroom where
communication felt like pulling teeth?

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.975
That's because the
seating wasn't efficient.

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:03.014
This concept helps in organizing
participants to facilitate smooth

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:05.235
communication and interaction.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.669
No more shouting across the table, please.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.910
And what about office layout?

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:15.825
Designing office spaces to maximize
productivity and create a functional

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:22.245
work environment because a happy
desk makes a happy worker mostly, or

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:27.525
consider event planning, whether it's
a grand conference or a lavish banquet.

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:31.395
You need to manage seating
to meet specific logistical

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.285
or hierarchical requirements.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:37.365
You can't have the chief guest
sitting next to the T boy, right?

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:38.745
Unless that's the plan.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.050
Of course.

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:44.865
Even in resource deployment, say
positioning resources or equipment

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:49.215
in a banking branch for quick
access and operational efficiency.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:53.625
You don't want the cashier running
a marathon just to get a pen.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.745
And let's not forget security protocol.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.430
Strategically placing security
personnel or cameras to ensure

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.290
comprehensive coverage and quick
response because you want to catch the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.900
bad guys, not just watch them walk by.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.950
So you see, it's not just
a puzzle, it's life skills.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.490
My friend breakdown of question types.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.820
All right.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.350
Let's talk about what kind of brain
teasers you'll encounter in your

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.150
exam based on past patterns, seating
arrangement, questions commonly

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.670
appear in these fascinating formats.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.010
First up, linear arrangement.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.470
This is approximately 40 to 45% of
your seating arrangement questions.

00:03:37.904 --> 00:03:42.915
Within linear, you have single
row unidirectional person sitting

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:47.475
in one line all facing the same
direction, like everyone looking

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.755
north or everyone looking south.

00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:52.695
Simple, but watch your lefts and rights.

00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:56.685
Then there's single
row bidirectional here.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:04:00.225
Persons are sitting in one
line, but some are facing north

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:01.964
and some are facing south.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:07.185
This is where it gets a bit tricky,
like traffic on a busy Indian road.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.680
And don't forget, double row
person sitting in two parallel

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.120
rows facing each other.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.210
It's like a face off, but with seating.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.090
Next we have circular arrangement.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.120
This makes up about 30 to 35% of
the questions you'll find facing

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.830
center where all persons around a
circular table are facing the center.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.700
Everyone's looking at each
other, maybe sharing a samosa.

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:38.745
Then there's facing outside where
all persons around a circular table

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:40.635
are facing away from the center.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:44.865
It's like everyone's giving each
other the cold shoulder and the

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.085
most interesting mixed direction.

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:50.895
Some persons facing the
center, others facing outside.

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:54.195
It's a true test of your
spatial awareness, my friend.

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:58.395
Moving on, rectangular or
square arrangement, roughly

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.140
15 to 20% of the questions.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.630
Here persons are sitting around
a rectangular or square table,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.030
usually at the corners and sides.

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.359
Again, this can involve facing center,
outside or mixed directions, just like

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.610
a typical family dinner, some paying
attention, some not a smaller chunk.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.640
About 5% is polygonal arrangement.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.210
These are arrangements around
tables with more than four

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.760
sides, like hexagons or octagons.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.060
Think fancy board meetings
with too many corners.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.380
And finally, about 5% are
combined arrangements.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.700
These are seating arrangements cleverly
combined with other puzzle types.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.990
It could be blood relations
professions, departments, and so on.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.400
For example, eight people sitting
around a table, each belonging

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.690
to a different department.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.700
It's like a multi-layered cake,
but with more logic and less sugar.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.540
I. Formulas and tricks.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.150
Now for the million dollar question.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.020
Are there any magic formulas for
seating arrangement problems?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.270
Not exactly my friend.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.900
These problems don't involve
mathematical formulas.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.790
Instead, they demand systematic
logical deduction and sharp

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.130
spatial reasoning, but worry not.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.840
I have some cool tricks up my
sleeve for efficiency and accuracy.

00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:25.405
First and foremost,
diagrammatic representation.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:30.924
Always, always, always draw a visual
representation of the arrangement.

00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:34.705
A simple line, a neat
circle, a proper square.

00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:37.375
Whatever it is, map it out clearly.

00:06:37.674 --> 00:06:39.294
This is your battleground.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.920
Paint it.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.370
Well then identify your anchor points.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.660
Start with clues that give definite
positions or relationships.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.200
For example, if it says, A sits at the
extreme left end, or B sits exactly

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.690
in the middle, grab onto those first.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.130
There your starting pegs.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.320
Look for fixed blocks.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.330
Identify groups of people whose positions
are fixed relative to each other.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:11.270
Like if P sits immediately to the
left of Q, treat P and Q as a single

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.169
block for a while, they're like best
friends who refuse to be separated.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.670
Understand relative directions
clearly, this is crucial.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.370
Be super clear about left and right based
on the facing direction of individuals.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.260
Is it north or south in a linear
arrangement or inward outward?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.370
In a circular one.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.665
One wrong turn, and your whole
arrangement goes for a toss.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.370
Don't ignore negative information.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.570
Clues that tell you what is not
true are just as important as

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.310
those that tell you what is true.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.920
For example, X does not sit next to
Y, helps you eliminate possibilities.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.050
Think of it as process of elimination
Sherlock style and remember.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.540
Iterative deduction.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.430
After you place new information,
go back and revisit previous clues.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.890
See if you can deduce anything new.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.590
It's like rereading a detective novel.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.990
You spot new things every time.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.700
Methods of solving.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.360
So how do we actually solve
these puzzles, my friend?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.345
We have a few tried and tested
methods, the direct placement method.

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:22.745
Start by placing individuals
whose positions are explicitly

00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:26.555
given or can be directly deduced
from the most definite clues.

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:31.685
Then like a master builder, you just
build upon these fixed positions.

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:32.945
Easy peasy.

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:34.985
Next, the block method.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:40.089
As I mentioned earlier, identify groups
of people who always sit together

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.059
like A and B, are immediate neighbors.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.260
Treat these groups as single units
and place them in your arrangement.

00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:49.390
It simplifies things, trust me.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.579
Then the Mighty Case method, ah,
this one's for when a clue is a

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:59.020
bit mischievous and leads to two
or more equally probable scenarios.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.000
What do you do?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.110
Don't panic.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.810
Draw separate diagrams for each case.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.740
Continue to deduce information
for each case independently.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.000
As you use more clues, you'll
find contradictions emerging in

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.750
the incorrect cases, allowing
you to eliminate them one by one.

00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:18.705
Until only the correct
arrangement remains.

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:23.175
It's like a reality show where the
wrong contestants get voted off.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:26.895
For those multi-attribute
puzzles where you have people,

00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:31.125
their cities and professions
use the elimination grid method.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:35.245
Create a grid to systematically
mark confirmed connections

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:37.315
and eliminate impossible ones.

00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:41.155
This works wonderfully for
tabulation based seating puzzles.

00:09:41.485 --> 00:09:43.795
It's your personal truth or dare chart.

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:46.225
And finally, chain deduction.

00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:49.795
This is where you link clues
that describe relationships

00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:51.385
between different individuals.

00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:55.265
For example, A is next
to B. B is opposite.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:10:00.515
C. C is to the left of D. Build a chain
of connections, one after the other,

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:02.765
until the complete arrangement forms.

00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:08.255
It's like connecting the dots, but with
people shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.875
Want to become a seating arrangement guru?

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.875
Here are some shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.305
Always do a first read through.

00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:20.715
Read all clues once quickly to get
an overall understanding of the

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.205
puzzle and no down key constraints.

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:25.455
Don't try to solve it immediately.

00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:27.645
Just absorb the whole picture.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.605
It's like serving the battlefield
before drawing your strategy.

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:33.709
Prioritize definite clues.

00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:38.510
Always begin with the most concrete
information, like exact positions

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.890
or immediate neighbors before moving
to more relative or complex clues.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:44.540
Start strong, my friend.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.449
Try to convert relative to absolute, if
possible, to convert relative positions

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:55.760
like X is third to the left of Y into
absolute positions in your diagram.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.584
This simplifies your mental
map, identifies strong clues.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.910
Look for clues that heavily restrict
possibilities or create clear blocks.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.570
These often involve immediate
relationships, extreme

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.640
positions, or central positions.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.440
These are your heavyweights.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.610
Use them first.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.900
Mark used clues as you use
a clue and incorporate its

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.640
information into your diagram.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.630
Mark it off.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.470
This ensures all clues are utilized
and prevents redundant rereading.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.260
It's like ticking items
off your shopping list.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.660
Maintain consistent notation.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.620
Use clear and consistent
symbols or abbreviations in your

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.670
diagrams to represent people,
directions, and relationships.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.375
Don't confuse yourself my.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.860
And the golden rule Practice with
timer regularly practice solving

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.790
various types of seating arrangement
puzzles under timed conditions to

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.160
improve both speed and accuracy.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.340
Because in your exam, every second counts
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.960
All right, my friends.

00:12:00.189 --> 00:12:02.560
Let's talk about the
potholes on this road.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.080
The common mistakes we tend to make.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:11.650
Avoid these like last night's undigested
burani first directional errors.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.210
This is a big one.

00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:18.939
Misinterpreting left and right based on
the facing direction can be disastrous.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.370
Remember, if a person faces south in
a lineal arrangement, they're right.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.579
Is towards the left of your drawing.

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:28.709
It's all about perspective.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.250
Then there's immediate
versus any distance.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.349
Don't assume X sits to the left
of y, means immediately left.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.170
It could imply any position to the left.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.610
Always assume immediate only
if it's explicitly stated.

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:49.760
Don't jump to conclusions like deciding
on a life partner after one meeting.

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:55.880
Ignoring negative information is another
major slip up overlooking crucial clues

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.160
like X is not an immediate neighbor
of Y can eliminate many possibilities.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.400
These negative clues
are your secret weapons.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.985
Making assumptions is a no-no.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.290
Don't infer relationships or positions
not explicitly stated in the clues.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.990
Stick strictly to the given information.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.750
Your brain is not a rumor mill my friend.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.020
Incomplete diagrams are your worst enemy.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.939
Not drawing a clear well labeled
diagram leads to mental confusion

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.770
and errors in tracking information.

00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:34.665
A messy diagram is a recipe for disaster,
not considering all cases, failing

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:36.975
to explore all valid possibilities.

00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:40.425
When a clue creates ambiguity,
means you are getting stuck

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:42.285
or choosing an incorrect path.

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:44.175
Remember the case method.

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:44.955
Use it.

00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:47.475
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:52.605
And watch out for counting errors
incorrectly, counting positions.

00:13:52.725 --> 00:13:56.445
Example third to the left
includes the starting person

00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:58.965
or not always be consistent.

00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:02.325
For third to the left, you
usually skip two people.

00:14:02.535 --> 00:14:05.175
Be precise, my friend, like a surgeon.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.540
WH framework summary.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.250
So let's quickly summarize our
journey using the W framework.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.290
What is sitting arrangement?

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.480
It's logic problems involving arranging
individuals or objects in specific

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.790
geometric formations based on clues.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.860
Simple yet challenging.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.750
Why do we learn this?

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.670
To assess your spatial reasoning.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.280
Logical deduction, analytical
skills, and attention to detail.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.829
Basically to see how smart you are.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:41.010
When is it applied In scenarios requiring
precise placement, optimizing layouts,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.020
and understanding relationships from
exams to actual event management.

00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:47.979
Where can you find this?

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.949
In competitive exams, event management,
urban planning, and organizational design.

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:55.750
It's truly omnipresent.

00:14:55.989 --> 00:14:57.640
Who benefits from this?

00:14:57.969 --> 00:14:58.660
My friends?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.010
Appearing for your exam?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.569
Managers, planners, and anyone
involved in resource optimization?

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.109
Basically anyone who wants
to arrange things smartly.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.969
And how do we solve it?

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.619
By drawing diagrams.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.390
Systematically applying clues,
eliminating contradictions and deducing

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.699
final positions piece by piece.

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:20.800
My friend fully worked out.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.689
Examples, example, one, linear
arrangement all facing North.

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.310
Question five.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.084
Friends, P-Q-R-S-T are sitting
in a straight line facing north.

00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:33.155
Clues.

00:15:33.545 --> 00:15:36.125
B sits at position one, leftmost.

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:41.555
End Q is an immediate neighbor of
p. R. Sits second to the left of t.

00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:44.495
S. Does not sit at any extreme end.

00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:46.714
Who sits in the middle of the line?

00:15:47.105 --> 00:15:55.025
A. P-B-Q-C-R-D-S understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:15:55.335 --> 00:16:01.335
Solution, step one, place p and Q.
We have five positions in the line,

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:04.575
numbered one leftmost to five rightmost.

00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:10.035
Everyone's facing north, so their left is
your left and their right is your right.

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:11.295
Nice and easy.

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:14.505
Blue one tells us P is at position one.

00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:17.295
So P is chilling at the far left.

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:22.785
Two says Q is an immediate neighbor
of P. Since P is at position one,

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.855
Q has no choice but to be at.

00:16:25.365 --> 00:16:27.765
Two, they're like inseparable buddies.

00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:30.735
Current arrangement, P is at position one.

00:16:30.885 --> 00:16:32.445
Q is at position two.

00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:36.405
The remaining empty positions
are three, four, and five.

00:16:36.765 --> 00:16:39.705
Step two, place r and t Clue.

00:16:39.705 --> 00:16:40.485
Three states.

00:16:40.515 --> 00:16:45.615
R sits second to the left of T. This
means there's exactly one person between

00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:48.795
r and t. And R is towards T's left.

00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:52.365
Considering our empty positions
three, four, and five.

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:57.824
For this pattern to fit, T must be at
position five and R at position three.

00:16:58.215 --> 00:17:04.395
If T were at four, R would be at two,
but Q is there, so T at five, R at three

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.665
works perfectly Current arrangement,
B one, Q2, R three, MT four, T five.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.285
We are making progress my friend.

00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:16.185
Step three, place S and
finalize the arrangement.

00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:19.875
Blue four says S does not
sit at any extreme end.

00:17:20.264 --> 00:17:25.935
This means S cannot be at position one
B is there, or position five T is there.

00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:28.754
The only remaining empty position is four.

00:17:29.024 --> 00:17:34.695
So S must be at position four and S at
position four is not an extreme end,

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.004
so it perfectly aligns with glue four.

00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:37.635
Brilliant.

00:17:38.205 --> 00:17:42.764
The final arrangement from
left to right is P-Q-R-S-T.

00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:45.645
It's like a perfectly
lined up school assembly.

00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:48.315
Step four final verification.

00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:52.905
Let's quickly check our work
like a good auditor B at position

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.915
one sits at an extreme end.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.649
True confirmed R at position three
sits second to the left of T. True

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.649
count from T one two RQ at position
two is an immediate neighbor of P.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.540
True there side by side.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.340
S at position four.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.290
Does not sit at any extreme.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.250
End true.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.260
Position four is smack in the middle.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.170
All clues are satisfied.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.880
Our logic is strong.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.870
The person in the middle of the
line, which is position three, is

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.960
R, correct answer is option CR.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.460
Example two.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.000
Circular arrangement, all facing center.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.175
Question six, friends.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:41.940
A, B, C, D, E, F are sitting around a
circular table facing the center clues.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:49.140
F sits second to the right of B. A
is an immediate neighbor of B. C sits

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:55.745
third to the left of DE is not an
immediate neighbor of a. Who sits exactly

00:18:55.745 --> 00:19:06.574
opposite to FAAB, CCDD, E understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:07.895
Solution.

00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:14.030
Step one, place B and F. Imagine
six positions around the circle.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.149
Let's say numbered one to six clockwise.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.320
Everyone's facing the center,
so their right is your right.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.530
As you look at the table
and left is your left.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.320
It's like sitting around a giant pizza.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.740
Let's confidently place B at position one.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.145
This is our anchor.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.500
Clue one.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:39.020
States F sits second to the right of B,
counting two positions clockwise from

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.899
B. Position one, we land on position
three, so F is at position three.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:50.004
Current arrangement B is at position
one, F is at position three.

00:19:50.604 --> 00:19:53.215
Step two, place a clue.

00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:57.864
Two states A is an immediate
neighbor of B at position one.

00:19:58.165 --> 00:20:03.745
So A can be at position two clockwise
or position six anti-clockwise.

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:09.264
This gives us two possibilities,
so we use the case method, step

00:20:09.264 --> 00:20:15.385
three, place, C, D, and E by testing
scenarios for a scenario one.

00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:18.525
Let's assume A is at position two.

00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:23.715
Our current setup, B one A two F three.

00:20:24.045 --> 00:20:27.555
The empty spots are four, five, and six.

00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:33.764
Now clue three says C six, third to the
left of D. Since they are all facing the

00:20:33.764 --> 00:20:36.825
center, left means moving anti-clockwise.

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:42.915
We need a pattern like D,
empty empty C. If D is at four.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.460
Then counting three positions,
anti-clockwise four.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.950
Three for F, two for A, one for
B. C would need to be at position

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.050
one, but B is already there.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.280
Contradiction.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.960
If D is at five, then counting
three positions anti-clockwise.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:05.780
Five for mt. Three for F two for
a C would need to be at position

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.970
two, but A is already there.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.139
Contradiction.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.730
If D is at six, then counting
three positions, anticlockwise

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.550
six, five empty, four empty.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:21.860
Three for F. C would need to be at
position three, but F is already there.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.149
Contradiction, since all
possibilities lead to contradictions,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.250
A cannot be at position two.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.280
This scenario is rejected, my friend.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.050
It's like a failed experiment.

00:21:33.495 --> 00:21:34.455
Scenario two.

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:37.515
Let's assume A is at position six.

00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:42.405
Our current setup, B one F three A six.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:46.215
The empty positions are
two, four, and five.

00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:50.590
Now clue three again, C
sets third to the left of D.

00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:55.635
We need to find empty spots
that fit D, empty MTC.

00:21:56.145 --> 00:22:00.044
If we place D at position two,
then counting three positions

00:22:00.044 --> 00:22:06.524
anti-clockwise from D two one B six
A five C would be at position five.

00:22:06.854 --> 00:22:08.235
This fits perfectly.

00:22:08.534 --> 00:22:11.324
We have D at two and C at five.

00:22:11.804 --> 00:22:14.294
The last remaining empty position is four.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:19.110
The last remaining person is E,
so E must be at position four.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:28.340
Final arrangement clockwise from position
one B 1D two F three E four C five A six.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.870
This looks promising.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.630
Step four, final verification.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.180
Let's crosscheck everything to be sure.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.740
F at position three sits second
to the right of B. At one, true.

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:42.780
1, 2, 3, correct.

00:22:43.379 --> 00:22:47.399
A at position six is an
immediate neighbor of B at one.

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:48.060
True.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.280
Six is next to one, correct.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.139
C At position five.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.930
Sit third to the left of D at two.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.139
True from D at two anti-clockwise.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.790
One B six.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.830
A five C. Correct.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.435
E at position four is not an
immediate neighbor of A at six.

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:10.490
A's neighbors are B at one and C at five.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.250
E is at four, so not a neighbor.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:13.939
True.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.919
All clues are satisfied.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.000
We've cracked it.

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:21.830
The person sitting exactly opposite
to F at position three in a six

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.970
person circle is the one three
positions away in either direction.

00:23:26.265 --> 00:23:32.205
So opposite position three is position
six A is at position six, correct?

00:23:32.205 --> 00:23:37.245
Answer is option A. A example
three, linear arrangement

00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:39.435
identifying relative positions.

00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:41.055
Question five.

00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:47.835
Friends, K, L, M, and O are sitting
in a straight line facing east clues.

00:23:48.315 --> 00:23:50.925
L sits exactly in the middle of the line.

00:23:51.315 --> 00:23:53.475
Gay is at position five, right?

00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:54.165
Most end.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.970
N sits to the immediate right of
LO sits second to the left of M,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:09.420
who sits to the immediate left of
N-A-K-B-L-C-M-D-O understand the question

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.120
before moving to explanation solution.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:19.110
Step one place, L and K. We have five
positions, one to five from left to right.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.929
All friends are facing east now for a
line facing east, their left is your

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:28.949
left and your right, assuming you
are looking at them from the front.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.899
So position one is the leftmost
and five is the right most clue.

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:36.885
One states L sits exactly
in the middle of the line.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.360
So L is at position three.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.540
Clue two states K is at position five.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.380
Rightmost.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:50.820
End current arrangement, MT. One,
MT two, L three, MT four, K five.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.960
Step two.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.670
Place N Clue.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.050
Three states and sits to the immediate
right of l. At position three,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.130
since we are interpreting right as
moving to a higher position number

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.950
towards five N is at position four.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:11.400
Current arrangement, empty one,
empty two, L three, and 4K, five.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.790
Step three, place, O and M Clue.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.570
Four states.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.110
O sits second to the
left of M. This means.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.780
O is two positions to the left of M. The
remaining empty positions are one and two.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:31.320
The remaining persons are o and m. For
O to be second to the left of M, M must

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.750
be at position two and O at position
one, because if M is at two, then

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.700
one position to the left is nothing.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.770
Two positions to the left is one.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.480
So O at one.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.580
Perfect final arrangement.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.879
One, M two, L three and 4K five.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.610
Step four, final verification.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.090
L at position three sits
exactly in the middle.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.320
True K at position five is
at the extreme right end.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.479
True N at position four sits to
the immediate right of L at three.

00:26:04.719 --> 00:26:08.979
True O at one, sits second
to the left of M at two.

00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:09.610
True.

00:26:09.879 --> 00:26:11.229
All clues are satisfied.

00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:17.385
The final arrangement from left to
right is OM, L, and K. Question,

00:26:17.505 --> 00:26:19.455
who sits to the immediate left off?

00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:21.735
N. N is at position four.

00:26:22.035 --> 00:26:25.365
Immediate left off N. Position
four is position three.

00:26:25.635 --> 00:26:27.075
L is at position three.

00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:27.945
Correct.

00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:28.965
Answer is options.

00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:31.035
BL. Thank you.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.715
See you in the next lecture.
