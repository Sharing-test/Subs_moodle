Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on input output.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.940
We are about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.000
with this tutorial concept explanation.

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:14.475
Input.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:19.005
Output is a topic in reasoning
ability where you are given a set

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.825
of words and or numbers as an input.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:26.835
This input goes through a machine
that processes it step by step

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.294
according to a specific hidden rule.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.610
Each step transforms the arrangement
or values in a logical sequence

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.860
until a final output is reached.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.410
Your task, my friend, is to analyze the
given input and its subsequent steps

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.990
because at least one example is always
provided to identify the underlying.

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:50.135
Governing the transformation.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.995
Once this rule is deciphered, you
apply the same rule to a new input

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:59.735
and determine the arrangement at a
specific step or the final output.

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:03.875
This topic truly tests your
observational skills, logical

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.305
deduction, and pattern recognition.

00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:10.175
Think of it as being a
detective for numbers and words.

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:13.565
A fun challenge, real world relevance.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.310
Input output problems enhance your ability
to identify systematic processes and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
predict outcomes in banking operations.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
This helps in understanding data
flow, process automation, or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.160
tracing transaction sequences to
identify discrepancies efficiently.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.150
Basically, if you can crack
these puzzles, you can crack

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.220
complex real world processes.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.650
Break down of question types.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:46.485
Based on past exam patterns, input
output questions frequently involve

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.345
several types of transformations.

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:52.965
Around 30% of questions deal with
word arrangement, which could be

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:57.945
alphabetical based on length, or even
by counting vowels or consonants.

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:02.630
Another 30% are about number
arrangement, where you might see

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.185
ascending or descending order.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:08.125
Or even sorting or various
mathematical operations.

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:13.704
Then about 25% of the questions are
mixed arrangement, combining both

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:19.674
words and numbers together, digit based
operations, such as some product square

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.660
or cube of digits account for about.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.700
10%. And finally the trickier
ones symbol or special character

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.250
based logic make up about 5%.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.370
So a mixed bag, but all about finding
that hidden logic formulas and tricks.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.560
Now for the secret sauce,
there are no specific formulas

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.850
to mug up here, my friend.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.050
Instead, you need to focus on
these pattern recognition tricks

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.640
like a seasoned detective.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.210
First, always observe
changes step by step.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.060
Look at what changes from step one to step
two, step two to step three, and so on.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:01.915
Is it a word, a number, or both
are new elements introduced?

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:06.205
Identify the element or
elements being moved or changed.

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:11.365
Next note, the position are elements
moving to the beginning and or

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.465
some specific internal positions.

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.295
Look for us sorting order.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.575
It could be ascending or descending.

00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:22.585
Alphabetical from A to Z or ZA
based on word length or even

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:24.745
the number of Ws or consonants.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.220
Also always check for
mathematical operations.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.830
Addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, squaring, cubing, sum

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.690
of digits, product of digits.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.180
Sometimes you'll find pattern repetition
where the same type of operation, like

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.980
placing the largest number, then the
smallest word repeats in alternate steps.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.700
Understand the difference between
shifting versus arranging.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.850
In shifting elements, maintain
their relative order, but shift

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.410
as new elements are placed.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.730
Arranging means elements are picked
and placed, potentially disturbing

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.440
the relative order of others.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.380
And finally, don't forget reverse logic.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.430
Sometimes the machine arranges
things in reverse order like Z

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.650
two A or largest to smallest.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.540
Keep your eyes peeled for these
clues, methods of solving.

00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:20.655
Here's a systematic approach, a
step-by-step recipe, if you will,

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:23.115
to solving input output problems.

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:28.995
First, you must analyze the example,
input and steps very carefully

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:34.905
examine the given input and each
subsequent step, step one, step two,

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.515
right up to the last step or output.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:42.025
Make sure you note down the specific
changes occurring in each step.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:44.665
Second, identify the rule.

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:48.265
For each step, compare
the input with step one.

00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:53.485
To find the first rule is a word
or number being placed based on

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.485
what logic, size, alphabet, parity.

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:01.205
Then compare step one with step
two to find the second rule.

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:06.604
Is it the same rule applied to the next
element or a different type of operation?

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:11.945
Continue this process for all given
steps until you identify the complete

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.044
sequence of rules and operations.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:18.815
Determine if the rule is applied
simultaneously or sequentially.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.510
Meaning one element at a time
or multiple changes in one step.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.360
Third, understand the final output.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.170
Observe the arrangement of the
elements in the final step.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.470
This confirms the overall
goal of the machine.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.760
Also count the total number
of steps required to reach the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.500
final output from the input.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.340
Fourth, apply the decipher
rule to the new input.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.210
Once you are confident about
the rule, take the new input

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.650
provided in the question.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.310
Start applying the identified rules
step by step to this new input.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.159
Maintain clarity by writing down the
arrangement After each step and finally my

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.950
friend answer the specific question asked.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.809
The question Might ask for the arrangement
at a particular step, the final

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:11.429
output, the number of steps required
or specific elements In a certain

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:16.469
step, refer to your derived steps for
the new input to answer accurately.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.900
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.060
Now for some smart moves to
a, these questions first, mark

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.100
changes when analyzing the example
circle or underline the elements

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.230
that change or move in each step.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.310
This makes the pattern much
more evident, like highlighting

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.020
key clues in a mystery novel.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.060
Second trace movement.

00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:43.215
Use arrows or numbering to track
the original position of an

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.224
element and its new position.

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:49.815
After each step, this gives you a
clear visual of the elements journey.

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:54.375
Third, categorize rules
mentally or on scratch paper.

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:58.034
Classify the rules as number
sorting word, sorting,

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.955
mathematical, operation, et cetera.

00:07:00.765 --> 00:07:02.864
This helps you organize your thoughts.

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:06.135
Fourth, trial and error,
but keep it limited.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:11.174
If you are unsure about a rule, quickly
test a hypothesis on a small part of

00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:13.484
the example to see if it holds true.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:15.375
Don't waste too much time.

00:07:15.494 --> 00:07:16.635
Just a quick check.

00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:18.705
Fifth, focus on the goal.

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:21.164
Understand what the question asks for.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:26.155
For example, which step is the
last but one to avoid unnecessary

00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:28.045
calculations beyond that point.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.535
And sixth, reverse engineering.

00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:34.855
If you are given a step and ask
for the input, try to reverse

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:38.305
the operations though this is
less common and often harder.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:40.995
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:41.985
All right.

00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:46.905
Let's talk about the pitfalls, the
booby traps so you don't fall into them.

00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:50.415
The most frequent error is
misinterpreting the rule.

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:54.375
It's like mistaking, alphabetical,
sorting for lens sorting.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.800
A classic mix up.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.360
Then even after understanding the
rule, friends make the mistake of

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.650
applying rule incorrectly to the
new input, like performing a number

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.050
operation instead of a word arrangement.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.550
Don't let that happen.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.730
Another common one is
ignoring relative positions.

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:16.265
Failing to notice if elements that
are not being processed in a step

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.035
maintain their relative order.

00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:22.925
This is crucial, incorrect step
count is also a frequent mistake.

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:27.875
Mismatching the number of steps required
or stopping too early or going too far.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:33.694
Also, don't fall into the trap of
assuming simplicity, believing all steps.

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:36.694
Follow the same simple rule
when the pattern might be

00:08:36.694 --> 00:08:38.705
alternating or more complex.

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:42.905
And finally, watch out for
calculation errors when mathematical

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:44.284
operations are involved.

00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:45.785
Double check your sums.

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:50.165
Friends, your exam doesn't give
marks for effort only for accuracy.

00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.745
W Edge framework summary.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.590
So to sum it all up, the what of
input output is deciphering a hidden

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.150
rule that transforms an input into
an output through multiple steps.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.160
The why is to test your logical
reasoning, pattern recognition, and

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.750
systematic problem solving skills.

00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:11.704
When is it applied?

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:12.905
It's applied.

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.645
When analyzing sequential processes,
data transformations, or systematic

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:19.834
arrangements, where is it common?

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:25.354
It's common in your competitive exams,
process analysis, and data handling roles.

00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:27.214
Who needs to master this?

00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:32.074
Candidates for banking or government
exams, data analysts, and generally

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.204
anyone who loves problem solving.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.650
And how do you do it?

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:40.930
By carefully observing step-by-step
changes, in an example to deduce the rules

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.180
and then applying them to a new input.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:44.260
Simple, right?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.750
Like making a perfect cup of chai.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.880
It's all about the right steps.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.689
I. Fully worked out examples.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.040
Let's dive into some real examples
where theory meets practice.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:01.319
Example, one word and number
arrangement, ascending order input.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:01.920
Good.

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:05.460
34, bad 72 and 58.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.780
Now 21.

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:08.980
Step one and good.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.449
34, bad.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.699
72, 58. Now 21, step two and 21.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.209
Good.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.650
34 bad.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.350
72 58. Now step three and 21, bad good.

00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:29.170
34, 72, 58. Now step four and 21 Bad.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.760
34. Good.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.350
72, 58. Now step five and 21.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.980
Bad.

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:37.329
34. Good.

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:41.770
58, 72. Now step six and 21.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.400
Bad.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.780
34. Good.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.730
58 now 72.

00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:48.975
Last step and 21, bad.

00:10:49.094 --> 00:10:50.355
34. Good.

00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:52.515
58. Now, 72.

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:55.275
Rule decoded in each step.

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:59.385
The smallest word alphabetically
and the smallest number are

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:01.155
alternately brought to the beginning.

00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:05.954
Words are sorted alphabetically and
numbers are sorted in ascending order.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.730
If an element is already in its
correct sorted position, the

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.470
step is skipped for that element.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.530
