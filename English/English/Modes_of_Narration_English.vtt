Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on modes of narration.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.039
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.145
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.135
So what is this bigshot narration array?

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.275
It is nothing but the simple
act of telling or reporting

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.435
something in English grammar.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.755
It's all about how we play the
role of a news reporter for

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.525
what someone else has said.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.765
There are two main ways
to do this reporting.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.394
First we have direct speech.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.905
This is when you are a copy paste expert.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:43.485
You quote the exact words spoken
by someone, no changes, nothing.

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:47.295
These words are always
hugged by quotation marks.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:50.025
You know those fancy inverted commas.

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:55.745
And usually a reporting verb,
like said, asked or exclaimed is

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.084
hanging around before or after.

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:02.074
For example, she said,
I am going to the bank.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:02.705
Simple.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:03.004
No.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:09.195
Then comes its cousin indirect
speech, also called reported speech.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:12.255
Here you are not a copy paste expert.

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:13.965
You are a summarizer.

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:20.024
You report what someone said, but in your
own words, fitting it into your sentence,

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.365
the quotation marks are thrown out.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:27.735
And we often use a little helper
word like that if or whether

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.745
to introduce the reported part.

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:32.895
Look at the same example, but transformed.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.110
She said that she was going to the bank.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.220
See the difference?

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.330
We changed.

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:39.350
I am to.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.660
She was the main game.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.220
When you convert from direct to
indirect speech involves changing a

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.130
few things, tenses, pronouns, and some
words that indicate time and place.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:54.615
Real world relevance.

00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:59.295
Now you might ask, sir, why
should I care about this?

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:04.365
Well, understanding these modes
of narration is super crucial for

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:08.145
clear communication, especially
in a professional setting.

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.980
Imagine you are trying to tell
your boss what a client said.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.980
This knowledge helps you accurately
report those client conversations

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.420
and internal discussions, making
sure the correct information is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.760
transferred and there's no confusion.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.270
It's a real world skill,
not just for exams.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.640
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.680
Questions on modes of narration
come in a few predictable flavors.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.100
The biggest chunk, about 40 to 45%
will be direct to indirect speech

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.500
conversion, where you have to change a
direct sentence to its indirect form.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.370
Then about 25 to 30% of the time
they'll ask you to do the reverse

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.100
indirect to direct speech conversion.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.950
A smaller but tricky portion, 15
to 20% involves error detection,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.180
where you have to spot the
grammatical mistake in a sentence.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.620
After that, you'll see a few
sentence improvement or correction

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.725
questions, maybe five to 10%, and.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.310
Easiest of them all fill in the blanks,
which makes up about 5% of the questions.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.720
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.680
All right.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.500
Now for the secret masala, the rules
when converting direct to indirect

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.080
speech, remember these key changes.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.660
First, the tense change, but only if
the reporting verb is in the past tense.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.110
Okay.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.935
Simple present becomes simple, past,
present, continuous changes to.

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.174
Past continuous present.

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.245
Perfect becomes past perfect.

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:54.765
Present, perfect continuous turns into
past perfect continuous simple past

00:03:54.795 --> 00:04:00.644
jumps to past perfect and past continuous
transforms into past perfect continuous.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:06.345
What about past Perfect or Past
Perfect continuous, ah, they are lazy.

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:12.225
They don't change future tense words
like Will or shall become Wood or should.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.410
Can becomes good, may,
becomes, might, and must.

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:23.235
Next, the pronoun change, the first
person pronouns like I, and we are loyal

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:25.095
to the subject of the reporting verb.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.925
The second person you changes according
to the object of the reporting

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:32.265
verb and the third person pronouns.

00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:35.955
He, she it, they are
completely independent.

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:37.665
They remain unchanged.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.100
Then we have the change in time
and place adverbs now becomes,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.770
then today becomes that day.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.200
Yesterday changes to the previous
day or the day before tomorrow.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.970
Turns into the next day or the
following day here becomes there.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.110
This becomes that these become those A go
becomes before and come often becomes go.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.660
And don't forget the reporting
verb change for statements said

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.120
to becomes told for questions.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.770
It becomes asked or inquired
for commands or requests.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.460
It changes to ordered,
requested or advised.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.230
But if said is all alone with
no object, it remains said.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.330
Finally, conjunction use.

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:29.515
For statements, we use
that for yes, no questions.

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:36.505
We use if or whether For WH questions, the
WH word itself acts as the conjunction.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:41.935
And for imperatives we use two plus
the word for positive commands and not

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:44.305
two plus the word for negative ones.

00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:45.025
Methods of solving.

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:50.005
So how do we solve these
questions step by step?

00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:55.465
Let me show you first statements
First, identify the reporting verb.

00:05:55.825 --> 00:06:01.525
If it's said to change it to toll,
if it's just said, keep it as said.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.400
Second, remove the quotation marks
and add the conjunction that third,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.530
change the pronoun in the reported
speech based on the subject and object.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.599
Fourth, change the verbs tense according
to the rules we just discussed.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.405
And finally, change any time or place
words for interrogative sentences.

00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:30.365
Or questions first, change the reporting
verb to something like asked or inquired.

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:31.295
Next.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:36.155
If it's a yes no question, use
if or whether as the conjunction

00:06:36.665 --> 00:06:38.375
if it is a WH question.

00:06:38.555 --> 00:06:41.495
The WH word itself is the conjunction.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:46.855
Then, and this is important, you must
change the question into a statement

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:49.495
by putting the subject before the verb.

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:54.565
After that, change pronouns,
tenses, and adverbs as usual.

00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:59.365
And please end the sentence with
a full stop, not a question mark.

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:04.615
For imperative sentences, which are
commands or requests first, change

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:07.015
the reporting verb to ordered.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:10.395
Commanded, requested, advised, and so on.

00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:11.865
Depending on the tone.

00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:14.715
Second, throw away the quotation marks.

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:20.775
Third, for a positive command, use two
before the main verb for a negative one.

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:25.455
Use not to before the verb,
and lastly, make the necessary

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:27.525
pronoun and adverb changes.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.909
For exclamatory sentences first,
change the reporting verb to something

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.730
like exclaimed, cried out or wished.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.630
Often adding a phrase like
with joy or with sorrow.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.070
Second, remove the quotes and
use that as the conjunction.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:48.455
Third, turn the exclamatory
sentence into a normal statement.

00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:52.625
Then make the usual changes
to pronouns and tenses.

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:57.724
Finally, end with a full stop
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:02.255
Once some smart hacks focus on
the reporting verb and the first

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:06.155
word of the reported speech,
this often gives away the answer.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:07.955
Use tense, elimination.

00:08:08.515 --> 00:08:12.715
If the reporting verb is in the
past, the reported tense must change.

00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:17.664
So you can eliminate options that don't
quickly check the pronoun changes.

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:22.195
This is a common trap scan for
changes in adverbs like now.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:26.484
Do then remember, indirect
questions end with a full stop.

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:29.484
So any option with a
question mark is wrong.

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:33.834
And always, always identify
the sentence type first.

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:36.740
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.089
Now, let's talk about where my
friends often make mistakes.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:47.030
A common one is an incorrect tense shift,
either forgetting it or doing it wrong.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.910
Pronoun confusion is another big one.

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.795
People also forget to use
conjunctions like that.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:59.045
Or if please don't retain the
question mark in an indirect question.

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:03.305
And a very silly mistake
is saying, he told to me.

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:05.165
No, no, it's just he.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.140
Told me.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.990
Also, remember, if the reporting verb
is in the present of future, the tense

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.240
of the reported speech does not change.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.870
Lastly, don't just
directly translate idioms.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.970
They might need rephrasing
to keep their meaning.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.490
WH framework summary.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.970
So to quickly summarize,
what is narration?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.530
It's the process of reporting
spoken words directly or indirectly.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.430
Why is it important for
accurate communication and to

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.080
convey information clearly?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.000
When is it applied, when quoting
exact words or when summarizing them?

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.295
Where is it used?

00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:48.755
Everywhere in daily conversations, formal
reports and professional communication.

00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:49.895
Who uses it?

00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:52.445
Basically everyone who communicates.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.005
And how is it applied?

00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:59.225
By following our grammar rules for
tense, pronoun and adverb changes.

00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:05.435
And by using the right reporting verbs and
conjunctions, fully worked out examples.

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:08.015
Let's work through some examples.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.810
Example, one statement
conversion question.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.579
The teacher said The earth
revolves around the sun options.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.109
A, the teacher said that the
earth revolved around the sun.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.640
B. The teacher said that the
earth revolves around the sun.

00:10:26.849 --> 00:10:30.785
C. The teacher told that the
earth revolves around the sun.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.270
D, the teacher said the earth
revolved around the sun.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.930
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.650
Okay.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.690
The sentence here, the Earth revolves
around the sun, is a universal truth.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.210
The rule says that for universal
truths, habitual facts, or historical

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.860
events, the tense of the reported
speech does not change even if

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.840
the reporting verb is in the past.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.600
So revolves will stay revolves.

00:11:00.969 --> 00:11:08.079
The reporting verb said has no object, so
it remains said option A and D are wrong

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.510
because they change the tense to revolved.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.459
Option C is wrong because told is
used only when there is an object.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:21.525
That leaves us with the correct
answer, correct answer, B. Example,

00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:24.165
two question, conversion question.

00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:27.495
He said to me, are you
coming to the party tonight?

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:32.715
Options A, he asked me if I was
coming to the party that night.

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:37.455
B, he asked me that if I was
coming to the party tonight.

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:41.775
C. He asked me whether I am
coming to the party that night.

00:11:41.955 --> 00:11:45.765
D. He asked me if I was
coming to the party tonight.

00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:49.425
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.600
This is a yes no question.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.600
First said to me changes to ask me.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.750
We use if or whether as the conjunction,
the question are you coming, becomes

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.420
the statement I was coming you changes
to I because it refers to the object

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.820
me are coming, which is present.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.790
Continuous changes to
was coming, which is.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.890
Fast, continuous, and the time
adverb tonight changes to that night.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.610
Option B is wrong because
that if is incorrect.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.320
Option C is wrong because the
tense am coming is not changed.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.860
Option D is wrong because
tonight is not changed.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:35.100
Correct answer a. Example three
imperative conversion question

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.110
the officer said to the soldier.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.050
March forward options A. The officer
ordered the soldier to march forward.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.370
B, the officer told the soldier
that he should march forward.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.090
C. The officer asked the
soldier to march forward.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.260
D. The officer commanded the
soldier that march forward.

00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:58.875
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:05.055
This is a clear command and imperative
sentence, so the reporting verb set to

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:07.574
should change to ordered or commanded.

00:13:07.905 --> 00:13:11.055
For imperatives, we use two plus the verb.

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:13.515
So March forward becomes.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.970
Too March forward option A. The
officer ordered the soldier to

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.010
march forward fits perfectly.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.670
Option B is not the standard
way to report a command.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.830
Option C uses asked which is too
polite for this context, option

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.870
D is grammatically incorrect.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.700
It should be too much.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.020
Not that much.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.160
Correct answer.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.750
A thank you.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.550
See you in the next lecture.
