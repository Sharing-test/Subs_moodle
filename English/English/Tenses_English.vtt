Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on tense.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.120
This is it.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.140
Concept.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.250
Explanation.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.000
So what exactly is tense you ask?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.050
Well, it's like the.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.500
Time traveler of grammar, a
category that cleverly expresses

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.090
when something happened.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.340
It's used to indicate if an action
took place in the past is happening

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.250
now or will unfold in the future.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.310
In the beautiful chaos of English
verbs are action heroes actually

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.610
change their form to perfectly align
with these differents grasping tenses.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.050
Isn't just about passing your exam.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.569
It's absolutely crucial for building
sentences that make sense for

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.830
understanding the precise timing
of events in any text you read.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.319
And ultimately, for truly effective
communication, it's like having a

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.379
super power to convey exact meaning.

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:05.144
Isn't it?

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:12.015
Now, broadly speaking, we have three main
tenses in English, just like your everyday

00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:15.735
traffic lights, past, present, and future.

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:18.975
But hold on, it gets more interesting.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.265
Each of these main tenses
isn't just a single light.

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:27.315
It's further divided into
four distinct aspects.

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:31.545
Simple, continuous, also
known as progressive.

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:33.615
For those who like fancy words.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.640
Perfect and perfect continuous.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.300
If you do the math, that gives us a grand
total of 12 common verb tenses in English.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.050
Each one has its own special purpose and
a unique form, like different spices in a.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.210
Perfect curry.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.789
Lemme give you a quick taste.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.710
The simple present is your go-to
for habits, daily routines.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.530
Universal facts and general truths.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.919
For instance, she walks
to school every day.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.310
Simple, effective, like your morning chai.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:14.495
Then we have the present continuous,
which is for actions happening right now

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:21.185
as we speak, all for temporary situations
like he is reading a book right now.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:22.295
Bet he is.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.245
Next up the present.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:24.935
Perfect.

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:29.255
This one is for actions that
began in the past but are still

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:34.235
continuing up to the present or
actions completed in the past, but.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.580
Clear result.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.810
That's still relevant.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.170
Now.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.830
Think of it as linking
the past to the present.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.310
For example, they have lived here for
five years and finally the present perfect

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.880
continuous, this busy tense is for actions
that started way back, continued right

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.820
up to the present moment and are either
still going on or have just just finished.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.050
Like when you say she has
been studying for three hours.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:04.954
Pew.

00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:08.674
That's some serious
dedication, and don't worry.

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:13.265
Similar patterns beautifully apply
to the past and future tenses

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:18.245
too, giving us all the tools for a
truly nuanced expression of time.

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.700
In English, it's like having a f. Full
palette of colors to paint your sentences.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.740
Real world relevance.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.100
Why is understanding tenses so important,
especially for our aspiring officers?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.400
Well, my friends, it's not just academic.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.860
It's absolutely crucial for you to
accurately interpret those intricate

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.710
financial documents to communicate with.

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:49.185
Crystal clarity with clients, making
sure there's no misunderstanding, and

00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:54.645
of course to report precise timelines
in all their official correspondence.

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:58.065
Imagine misplacing a zero in finance.

00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:01.965
Equally bad is misplacing
an action in time.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.785
Breakdown of question types.

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:10.035
Now let's talk about the exam,
because that's why we are here, right?

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:13.335
Based on past patterns in your exam.

00:04:13.635 --> 00:04:18.615
Questions related to tenses mostly
pop up in a few common formats.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.900
Roughly 40% of the time you'll see
them in error spotting questions here,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.270
your job is to find the grammatical
mistake in sentences, and often it's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.710
related to a wrong tense usage or a
subject word agreement Gone rogue.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.729
Then about 30% of the questions fall
under sentence improvement or correction.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.110
This is where you replace an
underlined part of a sentence with

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.419
a more grammatically sound option.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.719
And yes, tense corrections
are a frequent player.

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.090
Here, about 20% are fill in the
blanks questions where you need to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.469
pick the perfect verb form or tense
to complete a sentence meaningfully.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.500
And finally around 10% will be enclosed.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.900
Tests where you have multiple blanks in
a passage and understanding the context

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.969
and the right tense is absolutely vital
for the whole passage to make sense.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.420
So quite the spread,
just like a good buffet.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.050
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.360
Let's get down to some formulas.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.340
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.590
For the present, simple, it's
subject plus V one with an S or

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.660
E. S for third person, singular.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.820
For example, he plays C.
The present continuous uses.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.335
Subject plus is R plus VING.

00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:45.655
Like he is playing for present.

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:46.195
Perfect.

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:52.195
It's Subject Plus has have plus
V three as in he has played and

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:54.205
for present Perfect continuous.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:59.095
We have Subject Plus has
have Plus been plus VING.

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:03.025
So he has been playing,
moving to the past.

00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:06.475
Simple Past is just subject plus V two.

00:06:06.655 --> 00:06:12.235
He played past continuous is
Subject plus was were plus VING.

00:06:12.635 --> 00:06:18.484
He was playing past Perfect Takes
Subject plus hat plus V three.

00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:21.335
He had played and past Perfect.

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:26.974
Continuous is Subject plus hat,
plus bin plus VING example.

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:28.354
He had been playing.

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:34.215
Finally for the future Simple, it's
Subject Plus Will Shall Plus V one.

00:06:34.365 --> 00:06:41.715
He will play Future continuous Uses
Subject Plus Will Shall plus B plus VING.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:48.044
He will be playing Future Perfect is
Subject Plus Will Shall plus half plus

00:06:48.044 --> 00:06:54.495
V three, he will have played and Future
Perfect continuous is subject plus Will

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.700
Shall plus half plus Bin plus VING.

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:00.235
So he will have been playing.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:05.995
Now for a quick trick, friends, always
keep an eye out for those time indicators.

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:11.455
Words like always yesterday,
tomorrow, since or four, are like

00:07:11.455 --> 00:07:15.685
secret codes that quickly tell you
which tense is calling the shots.

00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:17.515
Methods of solving.

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:22.224
When you are tackling tense related
questions, a systematic approach

00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:24.594
can seriously boost your accuracy.

00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:27.865
First, always identify the verb.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:32.534
Pinpoint the main verb or verbs
in that sentence or passage.

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:35.505
Second, look for time indicators.

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:40.485
Search for those helpful adverbs
of time, you know, now, yesterday,

00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:46.034
tomorrow, always, often,
never since for already yet.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:50.655
Just or look for time
clauses like when, while.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.900
As soon as before, after, these
are your golden clues about when

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.700
the action is actually happening.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.100
Third, analyze context.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.740
This is where you become a detective.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.290
Try to understand the overall meaning
and the exact sequence of events in the

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.630
sentence or the sentences around it.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.480
This helps you figure out if an action
is ongoing, completed, a regular habit,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.550
or something planned for the future.

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:20.845
Fourth check for agreement.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:25.255
Always ensure your verb tense
plays nicely with the subject

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.445
in terms of number and person.

00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:32.545
And if there are multiple actions,
make sure the tenses are consistent.

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:35.575
Fifth, consider conditional sentences.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.140
If you spot an if clause, remember
the specific rules for tenses

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.000
in those conditional sentences.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.740
For instance, in a type one
conditional, it's if plus simple

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.470
present, then will plus V one.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.610
Simple as that.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:56.220
And finally, review reported speech
rules if direct speech gets converted

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.500
into reported speech, don't forget that.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.979
Typical back shift of
tenses that usually occurs.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.270
This systematic approach is
your GPS for tense questions,

00:09:06.689 --> 00:09:08.849
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:13.709
All right, friends, let's talk about
some smart techniques and shortcuts that

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:16.170
can make your life easier in the exam.

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.444
First up, the elimination strategy
in multiple choice questions.

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:25.224
Even if you are not a hundred percent sure
of the correct tense, quickly kick out

00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:30.564
the options that are clearly grammatically
incorrect or just don't fit the context.

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:33.714
This narrows down your choices like magic.

00:09:33.954 --> 00:09:36.114
Then there's keyword association.

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:40.854
Train your brain to link specific
keywords directly with certain tenses.

00:09:41.094 --> 00:09:46.859
For example ago, usually screams simple
past yet or already often whisper.

00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:47.755
Present.

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:48.295
Perfect.

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:52.165
And while that's usually a
friend of continuous tenses.

00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:57.625
Next, always do a parallelism check when
you are dealing with sentences that have

00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:00.324
multiple clauses or a list of actions.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:04.525
Make sure your tenses are parallel
unless there's a very clear and

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:06.385
logical reason for a time shift.

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.959
Fourth practice with timed exercises.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:13.715
Just like a cricketer practices in
the nets regularly, solving tense

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:18.065
questions under timed conditions will
significantly improve your speed and

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:23.945
accuracy, getting you ready for exam
pressure, and finally focus on verb forms.

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:25.775
This is super important.

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:30.635
Memorize the V one, V two and V
three forms of common irregular

00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:35.165
verbs because these little rascals
are very frequent sources of errors

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:36.905
when it comes to tense usage.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:38.455
Don't let them trick you.

00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:41.635
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:42.145 --> 00:10:47.485
Now, let's talk about those sneaky
common mistakes and misconceptions

00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:53.065
that friends often fall prey to
First using an incorrect verb form.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.944
This is like saying Go when.

00:10:55.944 --> 00:11:01.645
You should have said Gone for perfect
tenses, especially with irregular verbs.

00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:02.395
Watch out.

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:05.875
Second subject verb agreement issues.

00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:10.194
Mismatching the verb with the
subject in terms of singular

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.354
or plural is a classic error.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.385
Remember, he go is incorrect.

00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:16.344
It should be.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:19.015
He goes simple but often missed.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:21.915
Third overuse of present.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:22.485
Perfect.

00:11:23.025 --> 00:11:26.985
People sometimes use the present,
perfect for actions that have a

00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:29.505
definite specific pastime reference.

00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:34.005
For instance, I have seen
him yesterday is a big no-no.

00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:35.085
It should be.

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:36.645
I saw him yesterday.

00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:40.335
Fourth, confusion between
simple, past and present.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:40.875
Perfect.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:46.064
The simple past is for actions completed
at a specific time in the past.

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.555
The present, perfect.

00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:52.925
However, is for actions that started in
the past and continue to the present or

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:55.325
have a result that's still relevant now.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.275
They are not interchangeable.

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:57.695
Okay.

00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:00.815
Fifth misuse of continuous tenses.

00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:06.755
Don't use continuous tenses for states
or habits that are not ongoing actions.

00:12:06.995 --> 00:12:09.245
For example, I am knowing him.

00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:11.285
Sounds a bit off, doesn't it?

00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:12.725
It should simply be.

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:13.835
I know him.

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.989
Sext incorrect, conditional tense usage.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.520
Mixing up tenses in conditional
sentences is a common blunder.

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:25.810
The infamous, if I would have
known, I would have told you,

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:27.670
is grammatically incorrect.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.140
The correct form is.

00:12:29.375 --> 00:12:31.985
If I had known, I would have told you.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:34.835
And finally, a lack of parallelism.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:39.905
Not keeping the tenses consistent
across parallel clauses or actions

00:12:40.055 --> 00:12:43.835
within the same sentence, can make
your writing sound disjointed.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:47.435
Keep it smooth and
parallel like train tracks.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.580
W Edge Framework summary.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.420
Let's quickly summarize
everything we've discussed using

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.370
our simple W Edge framework.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.230
So what is tense?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.780
It simply defines the time and action
occurs, be it past, present, or future.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.940
Next, why do we need it?

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.380
It's absolutely essential for
clear communication, for accurate

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.175
reporting, and for understanding
the precise timelines of events.

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:17.614
When do we use it or when is it applied?

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:23.614
It's applied in all forms of communication
to specify the exact timing of actions

00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:26.194
and where is it used everywhere.

00:13:26.194 --> 00:13:30.935
My friend, in our daily conversations,
in academic writing, in professional

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:35.584
documents, and of course in
all competitive exams, then who

00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:36.905
benefits from understanding it?

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:42.335
Literally everyone who uses English
benefits immensely from understanding

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.045
and applying tenses correctly.

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:49.325
And finally, how does it work through
specific verb forms and auxiliary

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:54.005
verbs that brilliantly indicate both
the time and the aspect of an action?

00:13:54.215 --> 00:13:58.175
Simple, isn't it fully
worked out examples.

00:13:58.565 --> 00:14:02.435
Now let's tackle some
fully worked out examples.

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:05.600
Time to put our knowledge
to the test, shall we?

00:14:07.845 --> 00:14:10.185
Example, one question.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:14.565
Identify the part of the
sentence that contains an error.

00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:20.505
She, A, has been working on
this project B since five R,

00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:24.225
and she C is still not finished.

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:25.725
D, no error.

00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:31.334
Options A has been working B since five.

00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:31.844
Rs.

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:34.454
C is still not finished.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.105
D, no error.

00:14:37.694 --> 00:14:40.800
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:44.685
Solution, step one.

00:14:45.074 --> 00:14:50.655
First, we need to analyze the sentence
for any telltale time indicators.

00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:55.275
The phrase, since fivers
immediately jumps out, right?

00:14:55.785 --> 00:14:57.915
This indicates a duration of time.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.540
And the verb has been working is clearly
in the present, perfect continuous

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.880
tense, which as we discussed, is
perfectly used for actions that started

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.965
in the past and are still continuing
right up to the present moment.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.729
Step two.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.150
Now, let's recall the proper usage
of since and form, remember, since

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.199
is typically used to point to a
specific starting point in time.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:30.459
For example, since 2010 or since Monday.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.770
On the other hand, four is what we
use to express a duration of time,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.040
like for five hours or for two weeks.

00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:40.239
Step three.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.000
So let's identify the error.

00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:49.745
Since five R specifies a duration, the
correct preposition we should use here is

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:57.214
four, not since, therefore, the error is
quite clearly in part B, correct sentence.

00:15:57.635 --> 00:16:03.305
She has been working on this project for
five R and she is still not finished.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:04.234
Correct?

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:08.870
Answer is option B. This is
a classic one, so watch out.

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:12.825
Example two question.

00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:17.145
Choose the most appropriate
option to complete the sentence

00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:19.695
by the time we reach the station.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:20.475
The train.

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:26.415
Dash options A leaves B has left, C.

00:16:26.595 --> 00:16:28.725
Had left d. Will leave.

00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:34.005
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:36.105
Solution.

00:16:36.405 --> 00:16:37.275
Step one.

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:42.225
The very first thing to do here is
to understand the sequence of events.

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:45.074
We have two past actions described.

00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:48.405
We reach the station
and the train leaving.

00:16:48.855 --> 00:16:53.145
The phrase by the time we reach
the station is a huge hint.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.820
It clearly indicates that the
train's departure happened before

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.470
our arrival at the station.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.840
This is like missing your ride.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.980
Step two.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.500
Now let's apply the golden rule
for past actions in sequence when

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.730
you have two actions that both
occurred in the past and one of them

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.829
happened even earlier than the other.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.065
The earlier action is
always expressed in the.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.860
Past perfect tense, which
is hat plus we three.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.590
The later action, the one that happens.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.670
Second is expressed in the
simple past tense step three.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.810
So let's determine the correct
tense for the train's departure.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.985
Since the train leaving is the action
that occurred first or earlier than our

00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:43.820
arrival, it absolutely must be in the
past perfect tense, correct sentence.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.050
By the time we reached the
station, the train had left.

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:53.135
Correct answer is option C. No
point crying over spilled milk,

00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:55.535
or in this case a departed train.

00:17:57.135 --> 00:17:59.265
Example three question.

00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:02.715
Select the sentence that
is grammatically correct.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.765
A. If I would have known,
I would have told you.

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:10.725
B. If I had known, I would have told you.

00:18:11.025 --> 00:18:14.295
C. If I knew I would have told you.

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:21.525
D. If I have known, I would have told
you understand the question before.

00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:22.785
Moving to explanation.

00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:26.295
Solution, step one.

00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:31.305
First, let's identify the type of
conditional sentence we are dealing with.

00:18:31.755 --> 00:18:33.195
Look at the main clause.

00:18:33.495 --> 00:18:38.745
I would have told you this uses the
structure would have plus we three,

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:43.395
which is a classic characteristic of
a type three conditional sentence.

00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:44.385
Remember?

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.470
Type three conditioners are
used to discuss hypothetical

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.970
situations in the past and their
hypothetical results, things that

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.190
could have happened but didn't.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.300
Step two.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.340
Now, let's recall the precise structure
of type three conditional sentences.

00:19:01.754 --> 00:19:08.055
The correct structure for this type is if
plus past perfect that's had plus we three

00:19:08.325 --> 00:19:10.754
followed by would have plus we three.

00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:12.585
Keep this formula in mind.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:15.254
It's your secret weapon for conditionals.

00:19:15.465 --> 00:19:16.305
Step three.

00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:21.945
Finally, let's evaluate each option based
on a type three conditional structure.

00:19:22.274 --> 00:19:24.235
A if I would have known.

00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:26.225
Is incorrect my friends.

00:19:26.495 --> 00:19:31.535
The IF clause in a type three conditional
must use the past perfect tense, not

00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:37.505
would have B if I had known correctly,
uses the past perfect tense in the if

00:19:37.505 --> 00:19:41.615
clause, which perfectly matches the
type three structure we just discussed.

00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:42.635
This one looks promising.

00:19:43.585 --> 00:19:47.365
C, if I knew, uses the simple past tense.

00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:52.405
This structure if plus simple past
would plus V. One is actually for

00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:56.514
type two conditionals, which talk
about hypothetical situations in

00:19:56.514 --> 00:19:58.795
the present or future not the past.

00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:00.355
So incorrect here.

00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:05.305
D if I have known, uses the
present perfect tense, which is

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:09.655
also incorrect for this specific
conditional type correct sentence.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:16.250
If I had known, I would have told you
correct answer is option B. Spot on.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.120
Just like a

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.120
thank you.
