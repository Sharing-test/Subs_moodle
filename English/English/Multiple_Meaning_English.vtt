Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on multiple meaning ever felt

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.710
like your brain needed a power up.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.090
This is it.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.040
You know, English is a bit like that
one relative who has a different

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.530
story for every occasion, right?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.320
Words with multiple meanings, technically
called polyus words are a common

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.750
feature of our beloved English language.

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:30.155
In the context of competitive exams,
like your exam questions on multiple

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:35.795
meanings assess a friend's ability to
understand the nuances of vocabulary and

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:38.705
interpret words based on their context.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:44.375
Imagine a single word can have several
distinct meanings, and the correct

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:49.894
interpretation depends entirely on how
it's used in a sentence or passage.

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:53.825
It's like trying to pick the
right outfit for the right party.

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:59.125
For instance, the word bank can refer
to a financial institution where

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.684
you keep your hard earned money.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.854
Or it could be the peaceful side
of a river where you might go

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:09.565
for a picnic or even an act of
tilting an aircraft, perhaps when

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:10.955
a pilot is showing off a little.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.750
The challenge in these questions,
my friend, lies in identifying

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.220
the precise meaning intended by
the author, distinguishing it from

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.169
other possible interpretations.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
It's like trying to understand
your significant others.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.070
One word answers so much hidden meaning.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:34.725
This requires not only a strong
vocabulary, but also keen observational

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:40.185
skills to pick up on contextual clues,
those little hints and colocations

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:42.585
words that love to hang out together.

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.435
And of course, the
overall theme of the text.

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:48.134
Mastering this topic is crucial for.

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:53.825
Accurate comprehension and effective
communication, both in your exam and in

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:59.134
professional settings because nobody wants
a financial document to mean riverbank

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.414
when it should mean money bank, right?

00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:03.725
Real world relevance.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.580
And why is this important
in the real world?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.540
Well, precise communication
is absolutely vital.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.950
Understanding multiple meanings
ensures accurate interpretation

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.330
of financial documents, legal
terms, and client communications.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.380
This prevents misunderstandings,
avoids those oops moments

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.570
and ensures full compliance.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.470
You wouldn't want to accidentally
sanction a river bank for a loan.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.100
Would you write breakdown
of question types?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
Now let's talk about the different
flavors of questions you'll encounter

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.790
on multiple meanings in exams, like your
exam, they typically appear in various

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.320
formats, testing different aspects
of a friend's understanding while the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.570
exact percentage frequency can vary.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
Here are the common types, almost like
a menu of challenges for your brain.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.090
First up, the most prevalent
one, taking up about 50 to 60%

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.489
of the pie sentence based usage.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.380
Here a word is given and friends
must identify the sentence where

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.700
it is used with a specific meaning,
or choose the sentence where it is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.130
used incorrectly based on context.

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:18.260
Sometimes a sentence is given with a
highlighted word and options provide

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.810
different meanings or alternative words.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:27.925
Then we have contextual meaning making up
about 20 to 30% a word is presented within

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:32.995
a short phrase or sentence, and friends
must choose the option that best defines

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:35.125
its meaning in that specific context.

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:40.225
This really tests your ability to
inform meaning from surrounding words

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.965
like a detective looking for clues.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:46.825
Next, there's the odd one
out about 10 to 15% here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.920
A set of sentences of phrases are given
all using a particular word, and friends

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.240
must identify the one where the words
meaning is different from the others.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.780
It's like finding the black
sheep in a family of white ones.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.220
Finally, we have matching
meanings, usually five to 10%.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.020
Two columns are provided, one lists
words, and the other lists their meanings.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.990
Friends must match the words
to their correct meanings.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.089
Often with a few distractors thrown in to
keep you on your toes like a mischievous

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.180
exam Setter formulas and tricks.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.980
Now, my friends, while there are
no secret mathematical formulas

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.659
for multiple meanings, no E is
equal to mc square equivalent here.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.860
There are some super effective
strategies and tricks that can

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.690
make your life much easier.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.750
First trick friends, and it's a big one.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.780
Context is king always.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.539
Always, always read the entire sentence
or phrase where the word appears.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.460
The surrounding words are the most
crucial clues to its intended, meaning

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.500
they are like your local gossip
network giving you all the inside info.

00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:00.485
Second identify part of speech.

00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:05.284
The meaning of a word can completely
change based on whether it's used

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:10.115
as a noun, a verb, an objective,
or an adverb, for example.

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:15.635
Present as a noun is a lovely gift,
but present as a verb means to give

00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:17.409
something big difference, right?

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:23.599
Then look for colocations words often
appear with other specific words.

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.729
These are called colocations.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.030
Think heavy rain versus heavy traffic.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:33.890
Recognizing these fixed pairs can
seriously help you pinpoint the meaning.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.340
It's like knowing which
friends always go together.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:40.565
Next, eliminate obvious mismatches.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:45.995
If an options meaning clearly doesn't fit
the context, chuck it out immediately.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.645
Don't even think twice.

00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:48.965
It saves time.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.635
Also, substitute and test.

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:57.515
Try substituting the given options or your
inferred meaning back into the sentence.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:01.865
Does the sentence still make sense
and convey the original idea?

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:05.585
If it sounds like gibberish,
it's probably not the one.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.479
Next, think about root words, prefixes
and suffixes, while not always applicable,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.729
understanding basic etymology where
words come from can sometimes provide

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.159
hints about a word's potential meanings.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.870
It's like knowing your family tree,
and very importantly, practice

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.015
with homonyms or homografts.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.050
Familiarize yourself with common
words that have multiple meanings

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.860
but are spelled the same,
homographs or sound the same.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.120
Homonyms, regular practice with
these is your secret weapon.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.135
Methods of solving.

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:46.875
All right, let's break down the
step-by-step methods for approaching

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.735
these multiple meaning questions.

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.105
Think of this as your battle plan.

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:55.125
First, read the question
carefully understand what

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:56.865
the question is truly asking.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:01.035
Is it asking for the correct
usage and incorrect usage, or

00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:03.375
a specific meaning in context?

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.695
Don't jump the gun.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.190
Second, locate the target word.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.050
Identify the word in question within
the provided sentence or phrase.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.880
Don't get lost in the noise.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.460
Next, analyze the context.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.670
Read the sentence containing
the target word thoroughly.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.840
Pay special attention to all other
words in the sentence as they

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.150
provide crucial contextual clues.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.190
They are your best friends here.

00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:32.915
Then identify part of speech,
determine the grammatical role of

00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:34.655
the word in the given sentence.

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:38.645
Is it a noun, a verb, an
objective, or something else?

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:43.040
This step alone can often narrow down
the possible meanings considerably.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.770
After that, infer the meaning
based on the context and the

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.630
part of speech you've identified.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.070
Try to infer the meaning of the word
before you even look at the options.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.740
This way you won't be easily swayed.

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.320
Now, evaluate each option.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.570
Go through each option provided.

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:06.170
If the options are definitions, see
which one best matches your inferred

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.570
meaning if the options are sentences.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.620
Substitute the target word with the
meaning you are testing and see if

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.539
the sentence makes logical sense.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.090
It's all about fitting the puzzle pieces.

00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:22.705
Finally eliminate distractors, discard
options that are clearly incorrect,

00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:27.744
irrelevant, or represent a meaning that
simply does not fit the given context.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:31.255
And once you've done all
this, confirm your choice.

00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:35.664
Reread the original sentence with
your chosen meaning or substitute

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:40.794
word to ensure it flows naturally and
accurately conveys the intended message.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:43.824
Double check, just like
your mom always says.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.400
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.290
Want to save some pressure?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.220
Seconds, my friend.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.520
Here are some shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.000
Firstly, focus on surrounding words.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.100
The words immediately before and
after the target word are often the

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.439
strongest indicators of its meaning.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.560
Look for adjectives, modifying nouns, add
verbs, modifying verbs or prepositions

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.450
that change the meaning of a verb.

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:14.135
They're like flashing neon signs.

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:18.005
Secondly, check for idiomatic expressions.

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:22.954
Some words are part of idioms where
the meaning is not deducible from

00:09:22.954 --> 00:09:24.965
the individual words themselves.

00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:30.365
Think kick the bucket, which means to
die, not to literally kick a bucket.

00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:32.765
Be aware of these common idioms.

00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:34.204
They can be tricky.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.270
Then consider the overall theme.

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:41.380
The general subject matter of the
passage can help you determine

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.150
the most appropriate meaning.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.600
For example, in a financial context, stock
would likely refer to shares in a company,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.210
not the livestock running around a farm.

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:53.265
Common sense.

00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:53.685
Right?

00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.385
Also use the sense test.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.915
Does the word make sense in the sentence
with the meaning you are considering?

00:10:01.365 --> 00:10:06.015
If it sounds awkward or illogical,
like a square peg in a round hole,

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:08.325
it's probably not the right meaning.

00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:10.430
A super important shortcut.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.040
Practice with high frequency policy.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.670
Miss words, words like run, set,
take, get, put, go, turn, and

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.949
many more have numerous meanings.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.540
Regular practice with these common
culprits can significantly improve

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.340
your understanding and speed.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:33.375
And remember, don't assume first,
meaning the most common meaning of

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:37.545
a word might not be its intended
meaning in a specific context.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.095
Always consider all possibilities.

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:43.245
Don't get stuck on the first
thing that comes to mind.

00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:46.005
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:46.995
All right.

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:51.465
Let's talk about the pitfalls,
the traps many friends fall into.

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:55.065
First and foremost,
assuming a single meaning.

00:10:55.515 --> 00:11:01.275
The most common mistake is to assume
a word has only one meaning, and apply

00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:06.825
that meaning universally, completely
ignoring those crucial contextual clues.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:12.705
It's like thinking a bat can only be
a flying mammal, never a cricket bat.

00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:14.205
Another big one.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.500
Ignoring part of speech, failing
to recognize that a word's meaning

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.360
can change based on its grammatical
function, noun, verb, adjective,

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.550
et cetera, is a common blender.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.560
Also, over-reliance on dictionary
definitions can be misleading.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.550
While dictionaries are helpful,
they list all meanings.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.780
The challenge, my friend, is to
pick the contextually appropriate

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.240
meaning, not just any valid meaning.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.160
It's like having a menu with
a hundred dishes, but only

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.320
one is what you truly ordered.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.970
Many friends end up rushing
through sentences, not reading the

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.560
entire sentence carefully leads to
misinterpretation of the context.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.420
Slow and steady wins the race
sometimes then there's confusing

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.395
homophones with policy mis words.

00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:11.100
Homophones sound alike, but have different
spellings and meanings like 2, 2, 2.

00:12:11.675 --> 00:12:15.965
Polyus words, on the other hand, are
spelled the same, but have multiple

00:12:15.965 --> 00:12:18.245
related or unrelated meanings.

00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:20.885
Big difference, so don't mix them up.

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:27.155
Lastly, a simple lack of vocabulary
depth can hinder your ability to discern

00:12:27.155 --> 00:12:32.255
subtle differences in meaning or to
recognize less common usages of a word.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.560

primarily in competitive exams to

00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:16.920
test your vocabulary, contextual
understanding, and analytical skills.

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:19.135
It's your Brains fitness test.

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.114

By analyzing context, identifying
the part of speech, recognizing

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.689

Here, mine is used as a verb.

00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:04.125
Meaning to extract minerals, not the 1D.

00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:08.445
Be careful not to step on
a landmine in this area.

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:12.945
In this context, mine refers
to an explosive device.

00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:16.005
Noun, definitely not a possessive pronoun.

00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:22.575
Step three, identify the sentence where
mine is a possessive pronoun sentence.
