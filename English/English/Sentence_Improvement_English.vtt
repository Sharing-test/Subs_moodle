Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on sentence improvement.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.750
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.225
All right, so what exactly
is sentence improvement?

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.625
Also known as sentence correction?

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:22.725
You ask, well, my friend.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.875
It's a super important
part of English grammar.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.674
It's all about finding and fixing
grammatical errors, structural

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.265
flaws, and even those little
stylistic weaknesses that make a

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.905
sentence sound a bit well clumsy.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.170
The main goal you see is to make
your sentences grammatically spot on,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.230
crisp, clear, and totally effective.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.840
Often it means taking a highlighted
part of a sentence and swapping it with

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
something much better, something that
seriously improves its overall quality.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.420
Without mind you changing
the original meaning.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.755
This skill, my friends, is
like a mini exam in itself.

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:09.075
It tests how well you know your
grammar rules, your vocabulary,

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:11.145
and how you build sentences.

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:15.075
So it's not just about English,
it's about being sharp.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:17.565
Real world relevance.

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:22.214
Now, why is this important
for say, your exam?

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:26.925
Because strong sentence improvement
skills are your secret weapon.

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:32.744
Ensuring your communication in official
documents, emails, and reports is

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:35.175
crystal clear and totally error free.

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:40.625
Imagine an officer sending a confusing
email, a small misunderstanding

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:42.815
could become a big headache, right?

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:47.554
This precision, my friends, is
absolutely vital for maintaining

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:52.235
professionalism and avoiding any
misunderstandings in operations.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:59.705
It keeps everything smooth, like a well
oiled machine breakdown of question types.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:04.605
When it comes to sentence improvement
questions in your exam, they're

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:09.555
primarily designed to check your grip
on English grammar, your vocabulary,

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:11.865
and how you construct sentences.

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:15.735
While the exact number of
questions for each type can

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.440
dance around a bit, here are the.

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:21.065
Common errors and improvements
they usually test.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:23.705
First up, we have grammar errors.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:27.815
These are your usual suspects,
subject verb agreement.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.545
The verb should shake
hands with its subject.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:31.145
Remember?

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:35.735
Then there's tense consistency,
making sure your verbs aren't

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.415
time traveling unnecessarily.

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:43.615
Pronoun agreement pronouns must agree with
what they refer to, like two best friends,

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:49.555
articles, prepositions, conjunctions,
and parallelism, keeping things balanced

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:51.895
like a perfectly seasoned biani.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:55.345
Next we have usage errors,
which are about using words.

00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:58.575
Idioms and phrases correctly.

00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:01.935
Sometimes a word just
doesn't fit, you know?

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.055
Then there's redundancy or wordiness.

00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:07.035
Oh, this one's a classic.

00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:11.355
It's about sentences that are
unnecessarily long or keep

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:15.495
repeating themselves, like that
one relative who tells the same

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.685
story at every family gathering.

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:19.490
We need to cut the fat.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.735
My friends, structural errors are next,
dealing with how sentences are built.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:29.204
Think misplaced modifiers or
dangling participants that leave

00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:30.825
you wondering who did what?

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.554
Faulty comparisons also fall here.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:38.984
Punctuation errors are those tiny little
marks that make a huge difference, like

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.685
commas, semicolons, or apostrophes.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.700
Misplace one, and suddenly
the meaning changes entirely.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.710
And finally, my friends clarity
and conciseness the art of making

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.510
sentences clearer and more direct
because who wants to read a paragraph?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.580
That could have been a sentence, right?

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:00.075
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.704
Now, don't go looking for
mathematical formulas.

00:04:03.704 --> 00:04:07.785
Here, my friends sentence
improvement isn't rocket science,

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:12.585
but it definitely relies on a rock
solid understanding of grammatical

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.954
rules and some smart strategies.

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:20.024
Let's talk about subject verb
agreement or SVA for short.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:26.175
Always ensure your verb agrees with its
subject in number singular or plural.

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:27.315
No confusion.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.610
Here's a trick.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.560
Find the real subject, especially when
there are tricky phrases in between.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.840
For instance, you'd say the list
of items is on the table, not

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.970
are, makes sense, doesn't it?

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.160
Then comes parallelism.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.570
This means keeping a consistent
grammatical structure when you are

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.495
listing things or comparing ideas.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:55.925
The trick look for conjunctions
like and or, but ensure that

00:04:55.925 --> 00:05:00.065
whatever is on one side is in the
same form as what's on the other.

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:06.125
So it's, he likes to swim, to run,
and to cycle, not to swimming.

00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:07.355
Keep it symmetrical.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.780
Pronoun agreement is next.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.990
Pronouns must agree with what they refer
to in number, gender and even person.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.240
The trick is to clearly identify
the original word, the antecedent,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.710
and make sure the pronoun is
its perfect match, for example.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.469
Each friend must bring his
or her own book, not there.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.979
Remember that tense consistency is key.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.380
Maintain the same verb tense throughout
a sentence or paragraph unless there's

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.090
a super clear reason to switch.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.440
Establish your main tense and
then check if all other verbs

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.909
are playing nicely with it.

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:49.255
So it's, she walked to the store.

00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:52.025
And bought groceries, not bias.

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:53.255
Simple logic.

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.554
Modifier placement is
like setting furniture.

00:05:56.705 --> 00:05:58.325
Put it where it makes sense.

00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:04.085
Place your modifiers, adjectives,
adverbs, phrases, clauses as close

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:08.075
as possible to the words they
modify to avoid any confusion.

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:13.145
If a modifier seems to be describing
the wrong kink, it's probably misplaced.

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:19.805
For instance, he saw a dog with one eye,
means the dog has one eye, not he saw

00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:24.155
a dog running with one eye, which would
imply the running is done with one eye.

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:25.555
See the difference.

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:28.105
Then we have redundancy check.

00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:32.935
This is about being ruthless and
eliminating unnecessary words or

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:35.245
phrases that just repeat the meaning.

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:40.555
The trick is to look for common
redundant pairs like basic fundamentals.

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:44.875
I mean, aren't fundamentals
already basic or past history?

00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:47.844
End result, get rid of the extra baggage.

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.034
Idiom usage is another one.

00:06:50.424 --> 00:06:52.255
Idioms are like secret codes.

00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:56.155
Their meaning can't be guessed
from individual words, so you

00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:57.625
got to use them correctly.

00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:03.265
My trick for you get familiar with common
English idioms and their precise usage.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:09.474
For example, it's cope with, not cope
up with small but mighty differences.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:14.165
And finally, comparison rules
ensure your comparisons are

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.445
logical and grammatically correct.

00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:18.215
The trick here is simple.

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:22.325
Compare apples with apples,
not apples with oranges.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:28.055
For example, you'd say the climate of
Delhi is hotter than that of Mumbai.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:32.075
Wait, the climate of Delhi is
hotter than that of Mumbai.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:37.415
Meaning comparing climates, not Delhi,
with Mumbai directly, it's that of Mumbai.

00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.665
Understand methods of solving.

00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:42.465
All right, my friends.

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:48.435
Solving sentence improvement questions
effectively means you need a systematic

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.625
approach, like a good detective.

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:54.060
First read the original
sentence carefully.

00:07:54.594 --> 00:07:55.435
Don't rush.

00:07:55.705 --> 00:08:01.045
Understand what the sentence is trying to
say before you even peek at the options.

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:05.425
Identify the underlined part
and its role in the sentence.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:09.025
Next, identify the error, if any.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:11.605
Look for those usual suspects.

00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:15.070
Subject, VE agreement, tense
issues, pronoun problems.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.909
Parallelism or maybe a misplaced modifier.

00:08:19.359 --> 00:08:23.770
Also, check for word usage errors,
or if the sentence is just too

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.780
wordy, if you can pinpoint the error,
half your battle is won, my friend.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.539
Then examine each option.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.949
Go through options A, B, C, D, one by one.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.870
Substitute each into the original
sentence, read the entire

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.340
sentence with the new option.

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:43.809
Don't be lazy here.

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:48.195
After that check for grammatical
correctness is the new

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.875
sentence grammatically sound.

00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:54.135
Does it follow all the rules from
subject web agreement to tense,

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.325
consistency and pronoun agreement?

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:57.705
No shortcuts.

00:08:58.065 --> 00:08:59.175
Very important.

00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:01.965
Check for meaning and conciseness.

00:09:02.265 --> 00:09:05.925
Does the new sentence still mean
the same thing as the original?

00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:10.785
Is it clear to the point and
free from any unnecessary words?

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:16.305
The best option is like a perfect
batsman, not only correct, but also

00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:22.725
effective, and then eliminate incorrect
options as you evaluate each option.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:23.535
Kick out.

00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:27.135
The ones that introduce new
errors, change the meaning, or

00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:29.265
just aren't as good as the others.

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:31.905
Finally, choose the best option.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.685
Sometimes you might find two
options that seem correct.

00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:41.325
In such cases, always pick the one that
is the most concise, the clearest, and

00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:45.735
makes the biggest impact, all while
keeping the original meaning intact.

00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:49.695
It's about finding the best
fit, like the perfect shoe.

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:55.949
Shortcuts and smart techniques to save
time and hit those bullseye in sentence

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:57.510
improvement questions, my friends.

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:01.349
You need some smart techniques
like quick cricket shots.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.140
First, scan for obvious errors.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.000
First, quickly look for those low hanging
fruits like subject verb, agreement,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.844
tense errors or pronoun errors.

00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:16.825
These are often the easiest to spot and
can help you eliminate options super fast.

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:20.155
Then try a vertical scan of options.

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:24.805
Instead of reading each option
horizontally, compare them vertically.

00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:29.305
Look for the differences in verb
forms, prepositions, or articles.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:34.165
This helps you pinpoint exactly which
grammatical rule is being tested.

00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:36.780
Sometimes you can trust your ear.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.090
With caution.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.930
If a sentence just sounds
wrong, it probably is.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.880
Use this as an initial filter,
but always, always back it up

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.740
with your solid grammatical rules.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.870
Don't rely on just the field.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.300
Crucially, eliminate options that
change, meaning the improved sentence

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.040
must retain the original meaning If an
option messes with the core message.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.840
Kick it out immediately.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.720
Next, prioritize conciseness.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.310
If you have multiple options that are
grammatically correct, always choose the

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.710
one that is the most concise and direct
without sacrificing clarity or meaning.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.430
Redundancy, as we
discussed, is a big no-no.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:23.175
Also my friends practice
error identification.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:27.315
The more you practice identifying
different types of grammatical errors,

00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:29.745
the faster you'll become in the exam.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:34.725
It's like building muscle memory
for grammar and always focus on

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:38.565
the underlined part why you need
to look at the whole sentence.

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:42.915
For context, the potential error
or improvement is always in

00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:46.755
that underlined portion channel,
your inner laser beam there.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.540
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.770
My friends.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.880
Be aware of these common traps
and misunderstandings so you

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.720
don't lose precious marks in
sentence improvement First.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.860
Ignoring the original meaning
this is a classic mistake.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.450
Choosing an option that's grammatically
correct but completely changes the

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.220
original message of the sentence.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.740
Remember the improved sentence
must convey the same message.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.870
Then there's overcorrection.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.550
Sometimes friends try to fix
something that isn't broken or worse.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.360
They introduce new errors while
trying to correct a perceived one.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.730
If the original sentences already correct,
leave it alone like a sleeping lion.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.459
Many friends make the mistake of
focusing only on grammar while

00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:36.050
grammar is super important.

00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:37.369
Sentence improvement.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.680
Also checks for conciseness clarity and
how effectively you express an idea.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.959
An option might be grammatically correct,
but still verbose or just awkward.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.829
Also a big no-no, not
checking all options.

00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:54.839
Don't stop at the first
option that looks good.

00:12:55.229 --> 00:13:00.900
Always evaluate all choices because there
might be an even better, more concise or

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.180
more accurate alternative hiding there.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.089
Another common one is misidentifying.

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:10.410
The subject errors in subject verb
agreement often happen because

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.790
friends misidentify the true subject
of the sentence, especially when

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.469
there are phrases wedged in between.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.819
It's like finding a needle in a
haystack, but you have to find it.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:24.439
Lack of practice is a
silent killer sentence.

00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:28.189
Improvement is a skill that gets
better with consistent practice.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.260
Not practicing enough different types of
errors can lead to slow identification

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.210
and correction during the exam.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.689
Don't just memorize rules
without understanding.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.079
Simply memorizing grammatical
rules without grasping how

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.579
to apply them can lead to
misapplication in complex sentences.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:52.550
You need to understand the why behind
the what, and finally, ignoring context

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.360
while you focus on the underlined
part, the rest of the sentence

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.250
is your best friend for context.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.560
Ignoring it can lead to incorrect choices,
especially with pronoun references

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.599
or maintaining tense consistency.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.880
Think of the whole sentence as a team.

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:11.025
WH framework summary.

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:17.235
So my friends, to summarize with our WH
framework, what is sentence improvement?

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:20.865
It's the process of identifying
and correcting grammatical

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:25.275
errors, structural flaws, and
stylistic weaknesses in sentences.

00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:26.625
Why do we do it?

00:14:27.285 --> 00:14:31.694
To ensure clear, concise, and effective
communication in written English, which is

00:14:31.694 --> 00:14:33.885
super crucial for professional settings.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.620
When do we apply this?

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.420
Whenever we review written content
for accuracy, especially informal

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.920
documents, reports, and of course
your exams, where is it relevant?

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.390
Everywhere in written communication,
including academic writing,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.660
professional correspondence,
and those competitive exams.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.610
Your eyeing, who is this for?

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.580
Anyone aiming to boost their
written English skills,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.330
especially my friends prepping for
language-based competitive exams.

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:06.925
And how by applying grammatical rules,
truly understanding sentence structure,

00:15:07.105 --> 00:15:11.965
identifying common errors, and practicing,
practicing, practicing with all sorts

00:15:11.965 --> 00:15:15.685
of sentences fully worked out examples.

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:19.165
Let's dive into some real
world examples, my friends.

00:15:19.724 --> 00:15:21.795
Example, one question.

00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:27.104
Choose the option that best replaces
the underlined part of the sentence.

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:31.454
The manager, along with his
team members are working

00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:33.109
diligently to meet the deadline.

00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:38.595
Options A, along with his
team members is working.

00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:42.555
B, along with his team
members were working.

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:49.575
C and his team members are working
D along with his team members work.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:53.115
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:57.194
Solution.

00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.595
All right, let's break this down.

00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:04.215
Step one, identify the
subject and verb my friends.

00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:08.055
The true subject of this
sentence is the manager.

00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:12.855
That phrase, along with his team
members, is just an extra bit of

00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:15.405
information, an intervening phrase.

00:16:15.765 --> 00:16:18.735
It does not affect the
verb agreement at all.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.150
Step two, check subject verb agreement.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.870
Since the manager is
singular, what do we need?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.010
A singular verb, of course,
but the original sentence uses

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.290
are working, which is plural.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.130
Uh oh.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:33.880
A mismatch.

00:16:34.574 --> 00:16:37.185
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:16:37.574 --> 00:16:38.265
Let's check.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:43.694
Option A is working, is singular and
perfectly agrees with the manager.

00:16:43.965 --> 00:16:46.965
Plus, it keeps the
original meaning intact.

00:16:47.204 --> 00:16:47.985
Looking good.

00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:50.265
Option B says were working.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.380
This is plural and also past
tense, which doesn't fit a singular

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.150
subject or the current time.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:03.300
Context out option C and his team
members are working, changes the

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.609
subject to a plural compound subject.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.980
Now, our working would be correct here,
but this option changes the original

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.619
sentences structure and its emphasis.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:19.645
The original sentence was clearly about
the manager primarily, so it's not the

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:22.105
best replacement for the underlined part.

00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:27.714
And option D work is plural and
present tense, which again doesn't

00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:29.425
agree with our singular subject.

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:30.085
Gone.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:33.115
Step four, conclude The best option.

00:17:33.324 --> 00:17:36.564
So my friends option A
is the clear winner here.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.170
It correctly changes the verb to
agree with the singular subject,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.130
the manager, while preserving the
original meaning and structure.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:51.640
Beautifully correct answer is
option A example, two question.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:57.430
Choose the option that best replaces
the underlined part of the sentence.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.570
Having finished the report,
the lights were turned off

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.790
and everyone left the office.

00:18:04.355 --> 00:18:05.045
Options.

00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:08.225
A, the lights were turned off by him.

00:18:08.645 --> 00:18:10.955
B, he turned off the lights.

00:18:11.225 --> 00:18:13.325
C turning off the lights.

00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:16.295
D, the office lights were turned off.

00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:20.015
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.900
Solution.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.390
Let's tackle this one, my friends.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.260
Step one, identify the dangling modifier.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.540
See that introductory phrase?

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.340
Having finished the report, it
implies that someone finished the

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.050
report, but then the subject of
the main clause is the lights.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.150
Can lights finish a report?

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.110
No.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.180
Unless it's a sci-fi movie.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.350
This my friends, is a classic
case of a dangling modifier.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.300
Step two, determine the implied subject.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.320
The phrase clearly implies a
person finished the report.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.600
That's our implied subject.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:06.770
Step three, evaluate the options option
A. The lights were turned off by him.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.610
Still has the lights as the
subject of the main clause.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.140
The hymn comes later, making
it still a bit awkward and not

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.760
fully resolving that dangle.

00:19:17.544 --> 00:19:21.085
Option B, he turned off
the lights is perfect.

00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:26.754
It correctly identifies he the person
who finished the report as the subject

00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:31.495
of the main clause, making the sentence
grammatically correct and clear.

00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:32.725
No more dangling here.

00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:38.665
And option C. Turning off the lights
is just another participant phrase.

00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:43.795
It doesn't give us a clear subject for
the action of finishing the report, so

00:19:43.945 --> 00:19:49.375
not much help and Option D, the office
lights were turned off, is pretty

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:53.815
similar to option A, and doesn't fix
our dangling modifier issue at all.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.320
Step four, conclude the
best option, my friends.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.689
Option B provides a clear and logical
subject for both the introductory

00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:05.459
phrase and the main clause.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.360
It's concise, correct and
clears up all confusion.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.949
Correct answer is option B, example three.

00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:19.334
Question, choose the option
that best replaces the

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:21.435
underlined part of the sentence.

00:20:22.064 --> 00:20:29.475
She's not only talented in music,
but also in painting options A, but

00:20:29.504 --> 00:20:36.794
also talented in painting B, but also
paints well, C, but also in painting

00:20:36.794 --> 00:20:40.635
as well D, but also good at painting.

00:20:41.685 --> 00:20:44.925
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:47.235
Solution.

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:49.125
Last one, my friends.

00:20:49.275 --> 00:20:50.475
Let's nail it.

00:20:51.045 --> 00:20:54.735
Step one, identify the parallel structure.

00:20:55.185 --> 00:20:58.995
We have a classic pair of core
relative conjunctions here.

00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:03.555
Not only, but also these
guys are like twins.

00:21:03.765 --> 00:21:05.775
They demand parallel structure.

00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:11.505
This means whatever grammatical
form follows, not only must match

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:16.845
the form following, but also
step two, analyze the original

00:21:16.845 --> 00:21:19.635
sentence in our original sentence.

00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:25.395
Not only is followed by talented in
music, which is an adjective phrase, but

00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:32.445
but also is followed by in painting a
prepositional phrase, see the mismatch?

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.200
They are not parallel.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:42.000
Step three, evaluate the options option
A, but also talented in painting makes

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.980
the structure perfectly parallel.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.820
Now we have talented in music and talented
in painting both adjective phrases.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:57.905
This is what we call perfect harmony,
option B. But also paints well, changes

00:21:57.905 --> 00:22:02.645
the structure to a verb phrase, which
just doesn't match talented in music.

00:22:02.795 --> 00:22:09.755
So no go option C, but also in
painting as well is redundant because

00:22:09.755 --> 00:22:14.525
as well adds nothing new and it
still doesn't achieve that beautiful

00:22:14.525 --> 00:22:17.195
parallelism with the adjective phrase.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.260
Option D, but also good at
painting is an adjective phrase.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.930
Yes, but talented in music and good
at painting aren't as precisely

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.900
parallel or as elegant as option A.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.180
We are looking for the best option.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.810
Remember?

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.080
Step four, conclude the best option.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.800
So my friends option A
is the clear winner here.

00:22:41.189 --> 00:22:45.570
It provides the most grammatically
correct and perfectly parallel

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.489
structure, making the sentence
clear, balanced, and a joy to read.

00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:54.389
Correct answer is option A. Thank you.

00:22:54.449 --> 00:22:56.159
See you in the next lecture.
