00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.290
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on word usage.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.470
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.285
This is it.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.129
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.280
So what is this word usage all about?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.689
Think of it as the art and
science of using the perfect

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.610
word in the perfect place.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.159
It's not just about knowing big, fancy
words, it's about understanding their

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:32.310
precise meaning, their hidden feelings or
connotations, their dramatical roles and

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.890
how they fit into different situations.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:39.375
Mastering this helps you
communicate with crystal clarity.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:43.065
Avoiding those awkward,
did you mean this or that?

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:43.695
Moments?

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:49.545
Basically, it elevates your language
from Okay-ish to absolutely brilliant.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:54.825
This topic often tests a friend's
vocabulary, your grasp of idioms, phrasal

00:00:55.485 --> 00:01:00.615
verbs, and the tiny, sneaky differences
between words that look or sound alike.

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:03.435
Real world relevance.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.625
Now, why should you care?

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:10.695
Because understanding proper word
usage is a superpower for professionals

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:14.715
in every field, especially in
the formal world of business.

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.965
The key benefits are huge.

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:22.565
You get clear and precise official
communication, which means less confusion.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:26.405
You can interact effectively
with customers and colleagues,

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.325
building better relationships.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:32.075
You'll be able to accurately
interpret those complicated

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.265
financial policies and reports.

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:39.515
All this minimizes errors, and
most importantly builds trust.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.545
And where is this
superpower most critical?

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.899
Think about banking
and financial services.

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.220
All your emails and written
correspondence, your presentations and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380
reports, customer service interactions,
and especially those mind boggling

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.750
legal and compliance documents.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.480
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns from your exam.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.350
There are a few recurring
question formats you must know.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.470
The most common villain with a 30%
frequency is fill in the blanks where you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.350
pick a word or two to complete a sentence.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.239
Then at 25% comes sentence
improvement or correction, where

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.890
you have to find and fix a part of
a sentence with a wrongly used word.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.799
Close behind at 20% is error
spotting, where you just point out

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.660
the segment with the faulty word.

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:39.054
A bit less frequent at
15% is the close test.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.415
A full passage with multiple
blanks, testing your

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:44.605
vocabulary and context skills.

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:50.274
And finally, the tricky word swap
at 10%, where you must interchange

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.464
words to make a sentence meaningful.

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:55.394
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:55.965 --> 00:03:01.545
While there are no magical math formulas
here, we do have some fantastic tricks.

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.695
First, always use contextual clues.

00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:06.465
Read the whole sentence.

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:10.035
The surrounding words are
like little detectives helping

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:11.385
you find the right word.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:16.215
Second, become a word builder
by learning common prefixes

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.990
like un suffixes, like turn.

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:23.445
And Latin or Greek roots like bene or mal.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.805
This helps you decode
new words on the spot.

00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:30.975
Third, always check the
parts of speech is the blank.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:34.365
Crying out for a noun,
a verb, or an adjective.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.425
This can eliminate
wrong options instantly.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.210
Fourth, beware of
homophones and homographs.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.190
These are words that sound alike, but
have different meanings like effect

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.320
and effect, or are spelled the same,
but mean different things like lead

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.680
the metal versus let the verb next.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.170
Memorize commonly confused words.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.820
Create a list for pairs,
like lay lie or imply infer.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.275
And finally, use the elimination
strategy if you are stuck.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.315
Kick out the options that are
definitely wrong methods of solving.

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:16.685
All right, let's get into the step-by-step
methods for fill in the blanks.

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.654
First, read the sentence to get the vibe.

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:23.855
Then identify the grammatical
role of the missing word.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:28.450
Consider the context and the feeling,
the connotation, the sentence needs.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:34.445
Substitute each option and see which
one fits perfectly for double blanks.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:39.094
Make sure both words in the pair
are a happy couple for sentence

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:40.685
improvement and error spotting.

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:44.315
Read the sentence piece by
piece, looking for words that

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:46.445
feel out of place or just wrong.

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:50.044
Ask yourself if there's a
commonly confused twin that

00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:51.484
has been used by mistake.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:55.474
If it's an improvement question,
compare the options to find the

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:57.844
most accurate and crisp correction.

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:02.785
For a close test, first read the
whole passage to understand the story.

00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:08.695
Then tackle each blank one by one using
the surrounding sentences as your guide.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.565
Choose the word that fits
both dramatically and makes

00:05:12.565 --> 00:05:14.275
sense in the larger context.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:19.005
Shortcuts and smart techniques
ready for some smart techniques.

00:05:19.245 --> 00:05:21.135
Scan for grammatical cues.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.615
If a blank needs a plural
noun, you can immediately

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.475
throw out all singular options.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:27.435
Easy peasy.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:33.285
Also look for colocations, which are words
that are best friends and always hang out

00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:35.745
together like heavy rain or strong tea.

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:38.915
Knowing these pairs makes you super fast.

00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:43.025
Another trick is to check for
positive or negative connotation.

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:46.355
Does the sentence need a
happy word or a sad word?

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.385
This can narrow down your
choices dramatically.

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:53.975
Practice speech reading for context,
get the gist of a passage quickly.

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:56.530
Then zoom in on the specific problem area.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.960
And sometimes you can trust your ear, but
with caution, if a word just sounds wrong,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.780
it probably is, but always double check.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.630
Lastly, break down complex words.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.100
If you see a monster word, break
it into its root, prefix and

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.285
suffix to guess its meaning.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.795
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:21.875
Now let's talk about the
common traps people fall into.

00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:27.065
The biggest one is confusing
homophones, like using there

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.555
instead of there or effect.

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:30.995
Instead of effect.

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.555
Please don't do this.

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:36.575
Another classic mistake
is ignoring context.

00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:40.240
Just picking a word because
you know its general meaning.

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:44.135
Without seeing if it fits
the sentences specific need.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:49.115
Using the incorrect part of speech
is also common, like putting

00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:51.185
a noun where a verb should be.

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:56.645
Many people also misinterpret
idioms and phrasal verbs, taking

00:06:56.645 --> 00:07:00.155
them literally, which leads to
hilarious but incorrect answers.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.870
Be careful not to overlook subtle
differences between similar words, like

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.740
deny versus refuse, or less versus fewer.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.800
And finally, avoid redundancy.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.040
Saying return back is like saying
SHA return already means to go back.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.590
W Edge Framework summary.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.000
So to wrap it all up in a
neat package, what is it?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.280
The correct and effective use of
words, why do we do it for clarity,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.190
precision, and to avoid misunderstanding?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.960
When is it applied constantly
in all forms of communication.

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.549
Where is it essential in
documents, reports, interactions,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.859
and of course your exam.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.359
Who needs this?

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.650
Every single person who communicates,
especially professionals.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.419
And how do we master it?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:00.240
By understanding word meanings, grammar
context, and common usage patterns.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.990
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:05.210
Let's see this in action.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.790
Example, one question.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.219
The new policy will dash the
company's profits significantly.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:21.380
Options a effect B
effect C effect D effect.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.985
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:25.784 --> 00:08:26.174
Okay.

00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:32.235
Step one, the sentence needs a word
that means to influence the prophets.

00:08:32.564 --> 00:08:35.054
Step two, let's differentiate.

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.835
Effect is a verb, meaning to influence.

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:42.255
Effect is a noun, meaning a result.

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:45.555
The other two options are not real words.

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:50.960
Step three, the sentence
structure will dash needs a verb.

00:08:51.495 --> 00:08:57.285
Step four, since we need a verb that
means to influence effect is our

00:08:57.285 --> 00:09:01.305
champion, the correct answer is B effect.

00:09:01.935 --> 00:09:03.855
Example two question.

00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:08.715
Choose the sentence where the
word compliment is used correctly.

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:09.795
Options.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.835
A, she received a
compliment on her new dress.

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:18.245
B. The chef offered a free
compliment of dessert.

00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:22.985
C. His hard work was a
compliment to his dedication.

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:27.695
D. He paid her a sincere
compliment on her performance.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.610
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.300
Step one, let's understand
the two culprits.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.510
A compliment with an i is praise.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.970
A compliment with an E is something
that completes or makes perfect.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:50.120
Step two, let's check the options
in A, she received praise, so it

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.280
should be compliment incorrect.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.380
In B, the dessert completes the
meal, so it should be complimentary.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:02.900
Incorrect in C. His hard work
completed his dedication, so it

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.060
should be compliment incorrect.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.340
In D, he praised her.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.700
This is a perfect use
of the word compliment.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.750
Step three.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.410
Option D is the only
one that gets it right.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:21.680
The correct answer is D. He paid her a
sincere compliment on her performance.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.235
Example three question.

00:10:24.655 --> 00:10:30.505
The detective tried to dash the truth
from the reluctant witness options A,

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:35.395
elicit B, elicit C, solicit D explicit.

00:10:37.105 --> 00:10:40.435
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:40.735 --> 00:10:43.375
Step one, the context is clear.

00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:48.835
A detective is trying to draw out the
truth from someone who doesn't wanna talk.

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:51.625
Step two, let's check the meanings.

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:56.695
Elicit is a verb, meaning to draw
out or bring forth something.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:11:00.365
Illicit is an adjective, meaning illegal.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:04.205
Solicit is a verb, meaning
to ask for something.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:08.615
Explicit is an adjective,
meaning clear and detailed.

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:13.235
Step three, the act of drawing
out hidden truth perfectly

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:15.155
matches the meaning of illicit.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.135
The other words don't fit.

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:19.535
Step four grammatically.

00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:22.395
Elicit is a verb that fits perfectly.

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:26.715
After try to the correct
answer is a elicit.

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:27.975
Thank you.

00:11:28.095 --> 00:11:29.775
See you in the next lecture.
