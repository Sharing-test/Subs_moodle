Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Word swap.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.050
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.200
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.155
So what is this word?

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.355
Swap array.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:18.285
It's simple.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:22.845
You might know it as word
interchange or sentence correction,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.125
and it's a very common question.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.715
Type in your exam, they give
you a sentence, highlight a few

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:34.095
words, and jumble them up like
a badly mixed vegetable curry.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:39.595
Your task is to find the correct pair
of words that need to be interchanged

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:44.394
to make the sentence grammatically
correct and logically coherent.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:49.435
It's a test of your vocabulary,
grammar, and a little bit of common

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.775
sense, which I know you have in plenty.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.915
Real world relevance.

00:00:55.425 --> 00:01:01.334
You might be thinking, sir, why should I
care about this as an officer, my friend?

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.935
Clear communication is
absolutely paramount.

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:10.335
This skill helps you accurately
interpret complex financial documents

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:13.185
without misinterpreting a single word.

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:19.634
Imagine reading a customer's request or
an official memo and getting it all wrong

00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:21.650
because words were in the wrong place.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:23.705
That would be a disaster.

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:24.005
No.

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:29.255
So for financial documents, you'll
accurately understand terms and

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:34.025
conditions for customer requests,
you'll grasp their needs correctly.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:38.165
And for official communications,
you'll draft and interpret

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:39.875
everything with precision.

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:42.975
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:48.705
Now let's look at the enemy's
formation based on past exam patterns.

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:51.285
These questions come in a few flavors.

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:57.765
About 60% of the time you'll see the
classic two word interchange a sentence.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.274
Two words highlighted.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:01.405
You just swap them simple.

00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:06.685
Then about 30% of the time,
it gets a little spicier with

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.484
multiple word interchange.

00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:12.475
Here, three or more words are
highlighted and you need to

00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:14.305
find the correct pair to swap.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:18.145
And for the remaining
10%, there's a sneaky one.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.335
Identify the incorrectly placed word
from several highlighted options.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.790
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.640
All right, time for some secret formulas
and tricks to make you a word swap.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.359
Champion.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.900
First, always check for
grammatical agreement.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.730
The swapped words must agree
with the subject word and tense.

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.220
Second is contextual fit.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.280
The sentence must make logical sense.

00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:52.225
You can't have a fish climbing a tree,
can you third look at the parts of speech?

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:56.049
Often a noun is swapped for
a noun, a werb for a verb.

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:01.615
If you see a werb sitting in a nouns
chair, you have found your culprit.

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:06.235
Also, pay attention to
colocations those word friends

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:07.975
that are always seen together.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.255
Finally, use elimination.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.690
Look at the options and kick out
the ones that are obviously wrong.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.730
It saves a lot of time.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.620
Methods of solving.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.280
Here is the step-by-step
method, the how to guide.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.590
First, you must read the sentence
carefully to grasp its overall meaning.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.420
Second, identify the misplaced
words that seem out of place.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.390
These are usually your
highlighted suspects.

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:38.365
Third, analyze each highlighted word.

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:39.925
What is its job?

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:42.445
What kind of word should be in its place?

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.545
Fourth, test the options.

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:48.805
Mentally interchange the words
and reread the sentence to see

00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:50.755
if it magically fixes itself.

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:56.785
Fifth, after a swap check for grammatical
and contextual fit, is it perfect?

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:58.585
Does it make complete sense?

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:04.435
Finally, verify all parts of the sentence
to ensure everything flows naturally.

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:09.105
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to solve these even faster.

00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:11.054
Here are some smart techniques.

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.274
Scan for obvious mismatches.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.594
Some errors are so glaring, they
practically wave a flag at you.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.885
Prioritize noun, verb and
adjective relationships as

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:23.685
many errors involve these.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:27.455
Look for parallelism,
enlists, or comparisons.

00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:29.675
Ensure the structure is consistent.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.505
And here's a big one.

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:34.775
Trust your ear after a potential swap.

00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:36.545
Read the sentence aloud.

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:40.385
Often an incorrect
sentence just sounds wrong.

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:44.435
Lastly, if you are stuck, work
backwards from the options.

00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:50.615
Sometimes it's easier to see which choice
works, common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:56.914
Now let's talk about traps To avoid
a common mistake is ignoring context.

00:04:57.275 --> 00:05:01.865
Many a good friend focuses only on
grammar and forgets the sentence.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.289
Must also make sense.

00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:04.685
Don't do that.

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:10.115
Another is overlooking parts of speech,
like swapping a verb with a noun

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:12.094
without considering the structure.

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.945
Also rushing is a classic error.

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:20.225
Not reading the entire sentence
carefully leads to missing subtle clues.

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:25.505
Don't assume only two words swap in
questions with multiple highlighted

00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:30.185
words, and please do not jump to
the first seemingly correct option

00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:31.625
without checking all others.

00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:35.115
W Edge Framework summary.

00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:39.285
So to summarize everything,
what is this topic?

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:43.545
It's about identifying and
interchanging misplaced words to

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:45.885
ensure correctness and coherence.

00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:50.115
Why is it important to test
your vocabulary, grammar,

00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:52.305
and contextual understanding?

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:53.675
When is it applied?

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:57.815
When a sentence contains highlighted
words that seem to be in the

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.185
wrong positions, where is it used?

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.995
Primarily in the English
language section of your exam.

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:05.195
Who is this for?

00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:10.505
For any friend preparing for these
types of exams, and how do we solve it?

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:15.725
By carefully reading, analyzing the
words, and testing potential swaps.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:18.465
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.925
Example, one question.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:28.155
The A company decided to B
launch a new C product in the

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:31.034
market to D Boost its sales.

00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:35.585
Which pair of words needs to be
interchanged to make the sentence

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:37.835
grammatically correct and meaningful?

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:44.435
A. Ab B-B-C-C-C-D, D, no swap required.

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:47.585
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.880
All right, let's break this down.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.919
We read the sentence, the company
decided to launch a new product

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.440
in the market to boost its sales.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:00.419
Does anything sound odd?

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.969
Let's check the parts company.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.304
Is the subject fine?

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.090
Decided to launch is the
verb phrase also fine.

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.280
A new product makes sense to boost
its sales is a clear purpose.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.530
Everything is in its right place.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.580
The sentence is grammatically
sound and logically coherent.

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.580
No swap needed here, answer D.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.480
No swap required.

00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:26.945
Example two question.

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:36.515
The A brave soldier displayed B, danger,
immense in the face of C, courage

00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:40.535
and D adversity, earning him a medal.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:45.965
Which pair of words needs to be
interchanged to make the sentence

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.395
grammatically correct and meaningful?

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:50.040
A ab.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:08:00.180
B, B, C, C, C, D, DAC understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.820
Okay, let's read this one.

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:06.840
The Brave Soldier
displayed danger, immense.

00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:08.185
Wait a minute.

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:10.375
A soldier displays danger.

00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:11.395
No.

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.615
A soldier displays courage.

00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:15.325
He faces danger.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.605
We have found our culprits.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:23.995
The words danger be, and courage C
are clearly in the wrong positions.

00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:25.555
Let's test the swap.

00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:30.810
The brave soldier displayed courage,
immense in the face of danger.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:32.575
And adversity.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.555
Ah, much better.

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.805
Now the sentence is perfect.

00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:39.625
The most significant error is fixed.

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:45.985
Answer Option B, BC.
Example three question.

00:08:46.315 --> 00:08:48.985
The A leader delivered.

00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:56.545
A B, powerful speech two C.
Motivate the D discouraged team.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:01.495
Which pair of words needs to be
interchanged to make the sentence

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:04.045
grammatically correct and meaningful?

00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:11.814
A. A, B, B. D, C, C,
D, D. No swap required.

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:15.745
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:17.825
Let's examine this.

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:23.615
The leader delivered a powerful speech
to motivate the discouraged team.

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:28.355
This sentence actually seems fine,
but let's look at the modified

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:30.665
version used in the explanation.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:37.175
To demonstrate a swap modified
question, the A leader delivered a B

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:41.825
discouraged speech to C, motivate the D.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.095
Powerful team.

00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:43.995
Aha.

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:45.645
Now it is very strange.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:48.495
A discouraged speech illogical.

00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:52.845
A powerful team that needs
motivation, less logical.

00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:59.925
Swapping B, discouraged, and D. Powerful
gives us the original logical sentence.

00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:06.015
So in that modified case, the
answer would be B and D answer,

00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:09.645
option B, B, D. Thank you.

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:11.505
See you in the next lecture.
