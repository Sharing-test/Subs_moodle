00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on close test.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.790
This is it.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.625
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:17.025
All right, so what exactly is this
close test we keep talking about?

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.095
Think of it like this, my friend.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.725
It's a tricky little reading
comprehension exercise.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:28.365
Some smart eek removes a few words
from a passage, and then you, the

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.715
super detective, have to fill those
blanks with the most appropriate

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.545
words from the options given.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.115
It's like solving a
puzzle, but with words.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.000
This isn't just about knowing
fancy words, it truly assesses your

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.879
vocabulary, your grammar sense, and most
importantly, how well you understand

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.309
the context and flow within a text.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.129
Basically, it's a full on test of your
ability to grasp the overall meaning

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.739
of a passage and choose words that
fit logically, grammatically, and even

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.989
spiritually, if you know what I mean.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.259
Real world relevance.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
Now, why is this important,
especially for someone aiming for

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.210
say, a government job, my friend?

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.690
For an officer, having
strong communication skills

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.759
is not just a nice to have.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.899
It's vital.

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.994
Imagine in interacting with clients
or writing official reports,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.530
you need to be precise, right?

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.199
Close tests actually boost your ability
to understand context and pick the.

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:35.795
Exact right words.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.725
This directly sharpens your
professional communication and

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:44.705
analytical skills, which are absolutely
essential for smooth operations.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.985
No ambiguity, only clarity, just
like a perfectly balanced ledger.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:55.740
Breakdown of question types based
on the past patterns for your exam.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.789
Close tests generally feature
a few distinct question types.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.789
First up, the big boss, the one you'll see
most often is the traditional close test.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.419
This one has approximately 60% frequency.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.200
Here, you just fill single word
blanks in a passage simple.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.450
Yet effective testing your vocabulary
and grammatical understanding.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.240
Then we have the phrase based close
test coming in at about 20% frequency.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.410
In this type, you are not just
looking for one word, but short

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.519
phrases or multi word expressions.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:35.535
This really tests your contextual
understanding and idiomatic knowledge.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:40.125
Like do you know your reigning cats
and dogs from reigning buckets?

00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:45.765
Then there are the double fillers in
close with approximately 15% frequency.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.595
Oh, these are fun.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:52.845
Two blanks in a single sentence, requiring
you to pick a pair of words that fit

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:55.215
both grammatically and contextually.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.150
It's a do for one deal, but you
pay for both if you get one wrong.

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:04.285
Lastly, we have themed
passages, roughly 5% frequency.

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:09.084
While not a completely different
question type passages often revolve

00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:14.005
around specific themes like banking,
economy, or even current affairs.

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:18.325
So a little general knowledge of
the terminology there doesn't hurt.

00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:22.285
It's like your GK section
sneaking into your English paper.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.660
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.320
Now, for the mantra or the jugar to crack
these, there are no secret mathematical

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.710
formulas for close tests, no hidden
pie values, but we do have some really

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.480
effective strategies that act as your
personal tricks to maximize your.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:48.085
First, always, always, always
read the passage first.

00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.305
Get the whole kahani first.

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:55.465
Read the entire passage once to
grasp the overall context, the

00:03:55.465 --> 00:04:00.025
theme and the tone before you
even think about filling a blank.

00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:04.345
Otherwise, it's like trying to
put together a puzzle blindfolded.

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:07.635
Next, use contextual clues.

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:12.644
Pay very close attention to the
words and sentences immediately

00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:13.875
surrounding the blank.

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:19.815
These are your best friends, providing
vital clues about the type of word needed.

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:23.835
Is it a noun, a verb,
and adjective and adverb?

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:25.815
And of course, it's meaning.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.260
Then a quick grammar check.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.830
Ensure the word you choose
fits grammatically with

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.180
the rest of the sentence.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.730
Is the subject verb agreement proper?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.650
Is the tense consistent?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.870
Is it the correct part of speech?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.980
Don't let a misplaced
S or ed cost you marks.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.480
Next up vocabulary power.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.450
This is where your word
bank comes in handy.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.240
Build a strong vocabulary, my friend.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.180
Often the correct answer is a synonym or
a word with a similar meaning that fits

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.555
the context perfectly, like a glove.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.935
Then the Mighty Elimination technique.

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:08.825
If you are unsure, just kick out the
options that are clearly incorrect

00:05:08.914 --> 00:05:11.465
due to grammar, context or meaning.

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:16.145
This dramatically increases your
chances of picking the right answer.

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:21.184
It's like a process of elimination
in a reality show, but for words

00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:23.734
and finally, coherence and flow.

00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:27.234
After you fill a blank, be a good editor.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:32.125
Reread the sentence and the surrounding
sentences to make sure the passage

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.155
maintains a logical flow and coherence.

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:39.924
It should read like a smooth
story, not a disjointed WhatsApp

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.085
chat methods of solving.

00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:47.065
Let's talk about the distinct
approaches you can use to effectively

00:05:47.065 --> 00:05:49.255
solve these closed test problems.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:52.354
We call this the global reading approach.

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:58.414
First, read the entire passage quickly,
just a swift glance to understand

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:02.615
its general meaning, the tone, and
what the author is trying to say.

00:06:03.094 --> 00:06:07.534
This initial read helps in
grasping the overall context, which

00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:11.855
believe me is absolutely crucial
for picking the right words.

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:15.875
After that, we move to
sentence by sentence analysis.

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:19.205
Now go back and really zoom in on.

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:23.474
Each sentence that has a blank
focus on the words immediately

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:25.215
before and after the blank.

00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:30.585
They are like breadcrumbs, often
providing direct clues about the required

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.775
words, grammatical form and meaning.

00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:37.185
Then the grammatical fit
method for each blank.

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:38.715
Put on your grammar hat.

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:41.835
Consider the grammatical
structure of the sentence.

00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:43.034
Should it be a noun?

00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:48.105
A verb, an adjective, an adverb,
a preposition, or a conjunction.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:51.945
Eliminate options that just
don't fit grammatically.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.485
If it doesn't sound right,
it probably isn't right.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:58.995
Following that, it's the
contextual fit method.

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:02.480
Now, evaluate the meaning
of the sentence and the.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.510
Overall passage, choose the
word that makes the most

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.400
sense in that given context.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.080
This means you need to understand
synonyms, antonyms, and even

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.560
the subtle nuances of meaning
between similar sounding words.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.880
It's like picking the perfect
spice for a dish too much or

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.590
too little, and it's ruined.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.790
After you've made a choice, do
a cohesion and coherence check.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.230
Once you've tentatively filled a
blank, reread that sentence and the

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.900
surrounding ones, does it flow smoothly?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.160
Does it make sense?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.540
In the grand scheme of things, the
passage should read as one cohesive

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.400
unit, like a well-oiled machine.

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:46.765
And if you are still scratching your
head, use elimination and substitution.

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:50.905
If you're torn between two or
more options, just try plugging

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:54.415
each one into the blank and
rereading the sentence aloud.

00:07:54.925 --> 00:08:00.625
This often magically helps in identifying
the most suitable word systematically.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:04.465
Eliminate the less plausible
options like weeding out the garden.

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.260
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.789
All right, my friend.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.530
Mastering close tests.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.950
Under exam pressure means you
need some smart techniques,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.810
some smart jugar if you will.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.150
First scan for keywords.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.390
Quickly spot the important
words around the blank.

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:23.490
Nouns, verbs, adjectives.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.865
These are often the ones dictating
what kind of word you need.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.800
Next identify tone is the passage.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.549
Happy, sad, serious,
funny, formal, informal.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.270
The tone helps you pick words
that align with the sentiment.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.350
You wouldn't use giggles in a
serious financial report, right?

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.810
Then look for connectors.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.130
Pay close attention to
conjunctions like and, but however,

00:08:49.189 --> 00:08:50.845
therefore, and prepositions.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.530
They are the glue of sentences
and ideas revealing relationships.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.170
Understanding them is half the battle one.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.790
Also, knowledge of prefixes and
suffixes can be a lifesaver.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.900
Common prefixes like unre and suffixes,
lactation ability and lie can quickly

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.590
tell you the part of speech and even
the meaning of unfamiliar words.

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:17.605
It's like having x-ray vision
for words for double fillers.

00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:21.265
Use a pairing strategy in
those two blank questions.

00:09:21.475 --> 00:09:24.564
Try to find one word that
fits perfectly first.

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:28.885
Once you have that, check the options
that contain that word, and then

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:30.775
evaluate the second word in the pair.

00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:32.965
This saves a lot of time.

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:37.335
And speaking of time, practice
speed reading regularly.

00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:41.655
Practice reading quickly to improve
your ability to grasp the main idea

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:45.705
and context of a passage without
getting stuck on every single word.

00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:49.965
Finally, reverse engineering
if you are completely stuck.

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:54.345
Sometimes reading the options first
and then trying to fit them into the

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.564
blank can offer a fresh perspective.

00:09:56.895 --> 00:10:00.435
But remember, this should be
your absolute last resort.

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:01.335
Your hail Mary.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.910
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.410
Now let's talk about the potholes
on this road to close Test mastery.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:16.020
Avoid these common pitfalls to
keep your accuracy high First,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.390
ignoring the overall context.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.610
This is a classic blunder.

00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:26.255
Filling a blank based only on the
immediate sentence without thinking about

00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:31.535
the whole passages, meaning it's like
looking at one tree and assuming you

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:36.755
know the whole forest, you might end up
with a grammatically correct word, but

00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:39.785
contextually it'll be a complete mis fit.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.220
Next over reliance on vocabulary.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:49.640
Yes, vocabulary is vital, like the
ingredients for a good curry, but simply

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.100
knowing the meaning of words isn't enough.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.590
The chosen word must also fit the
grammatical structure and the overall

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.590
tone of the passage it needs to harmonize.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:04.015
Then lack of grammatical awareness.

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:09.415
Many errors happen because friends
don't pay enough attention to subject

00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:14.185
word agreement, tense, consistency,
or picking the right part of speech.

00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:19.435
It's the small things that bite you
and then rushing through the passage.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.030
Speed reading is good,
but without comprehension.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.859
It's just speed looking.

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:30.770
Rushing often leads to misinterpreting the
passages, meaning and making silly errors.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:31.790
Don't do it.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.189
Another big one, not rereading.

00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:39.155
Failing to reread the passage after
filling in the blanks can leave

00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:44.165
you with a disjointed or illogical
text, a clear sign of errors that

00:11:44.165 --> 00:11:45.725
you could have easily caught.

00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:50.525
It's like forgetting to taste your
own cooking, also, choosing the

00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:52.445
first seemingly correct option.

00:11:52.805 --> 00:11:58.180
Sometimes multiple options might look
good, like various suites at a shop, but

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:04.355
it's crucial to evaluate all choices and
pick the most appropriate one considering.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.380
All aspects of context and
grammar don't jump the gun.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.530
And finally, ignoring negative prefixes
or suffixes, misinterpreting words

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:20.650
with negative prefixes like un disin
or suffixes, can completely flip

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.430
the meaning of a sentence leading
you straight to the wrong answer.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.150
So pay attention to these
small but mighty elements.

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:30.660
WH framework summary.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:36.329
Let's quickly sum up this close test
business using our classic WH framework.

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:37.890
So what is it?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.550
It's a reading comprehension
exercise where you fill in

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.050
missing words in a passage.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.099
Simple write.

00:12:44.405 --> 00:12:45.365
Why do we do it?

00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:49.505
Because it assesses your
vocabulary, grammar, contextual

00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:51.425
understanding, and coherence.

00:12:51.665 --> 00:12:54.245
Basically how good you are with words.

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:55.595
When is it applied?

00:12:55.865 --> 00:13:00.755
Mostly in competitive exams, like
your exam to test English proficiency.

00:13:01.104 --> 00:13:02.214
Where will you find it?

00:13:02.635 --> 00:13:06.834
In the English language section of
banking and other government exams,

00:13:07.074 --> 00:13:09.775
it's a celebrity there who uses it?

00:13:10.135 --> 00:13:14.425
Friends and aspirants preparing for
competitive exams just like you.

00:13:14.785 --> 00:13:16.074
And how do you conquer it?

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:20.785
By analyzing context, grammar,
and vocabulary to pick the

00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.375
most appropriate words.

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:24.474
It's a whole strategy game.

00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:26.155
Fully worked out.

00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:26.814
Examples.

00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:28.365
All right.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:32.265
Time to roll up our sleeves
and see some live action.

00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:35.594
Example, one question.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:41.175
The government has launched a new
scheme to dash the agricultural

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:46.604
sector, aiming to provide better
irrigation facilities and financial

00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:50.985
support to farmers Options a hinder.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:56.175
B Boost, C neglect, D Suppress.

00:13:56.715 --> 00:13:59.660
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:01.785
Solution.

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:04.995
Step one, analyze the context.

00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:09.405
The sentence is talking about
a new government scheme with

00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:14.295
some really positive aims, like
providing better irrigation and

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:16.185
financial support to farmers.

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:21.854
This clearly indicates a positive
action is being taken a good intention.

00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:25.275
You see, step two, evaluate the options.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.980
A hinder means to obstruct
or create difficulties.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.120
Now, why would a government
scheme hinder a sector it wants

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.250
to help, doesn't fit, does it?

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.880
B, boost means to help or encourage
something to increase or improve.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.100
Ah, this aligns perfectly with
the positive context of better

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.440
irrigation and financial support.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.060
Sounds like a match.

00:14:52.464 --> 00:14:56.574
C neglect means to fail to
care for something properly.

00:14:56.905 --> 00:15:01.314
Again, if they're launching a scheme,
they're definitely not neglecting it.

00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:03.685
This contradicts the whole purpose.

00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:08.305
D suppress means to forcibly
put an end to something.

00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:10.525
This is totally irrelevant here.

00:15:10.824 --> 00:15:15.444
The government wants to support, not
suppress its own agricultural sector.

00:15:15.925 --> 00:15:17.875
Step three, select the best.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.194
Fit the word.

00:15:19.275 --> 00:15:20.475
Boost here, my friend.

00:15:20.685 --> 00:15:24.555
It perfectly reflects the
government's intention to improve

00:15:24.555 --> 00:15:26.834
and uplift the agricultural sector.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.145
It's like giving it a superpower.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:34.515
Correct answer is option
B. Example two question.

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:41.084
Despite his initial dash, the team leader
eventually agreed to the innovative

00:15:41.084 --> 00:15:47.280
marketing strategy proposed by the
new intern options, a enthusiasm.

00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:52.860
B Reluctance, C Eagerness D approval.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.255
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.260
Solution.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.200
Step one, analyze the context.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.730
Look at the word despite right
at the beginning of the sentence,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.100
this word is a big glue.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.510
It tells us there's a contrast
between the team leader's initial

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.330
feeling and his eventual agreement.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.910
So his initial reaction must have
been something negative or hesitant.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.320
Opposite to agreeing.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.070
Step two, evaluate the options.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.720
A enthusiasm means intense
and eager enjoyment.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.070
This is the opposite of what
despite suggests, because if he

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.120
was enthusiastic initially, he
wouldn't need to eventually agree.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.290
Perfect.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.160
B reluctance means
unwillingness to do something.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.880
Aha.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.340
This fits the contrast perfectly.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.050
He was unwilling initially,
despite which he eventually agreed.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.920
Perfect.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.440
C eagerness is quite similar to
enthusiasm and again contradicts the

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.470
context given by, despite D approval
means agreement or acceptance.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.610
This is what he eventually
gave, not his initial feeling.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.090
So.

00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:09.185
Out it goes.

00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:11.615
Step three, select the best fit.

00:17:12.034 --> 00:17:15.994
The word reluctance accurately
captures the initial hesitation

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:20.224
of the team leader creating that
logical contrast in the sentence.

00:17:20.494 --> 00:17:25.805
It's like when you don't want to wake up
early, but eventually do for a good cause.

00:17:26.135 --> 00:17:29.770
Correct answer is option B. Example three.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.270
Question the company's profits have dash
increased this quarter, thanks to the

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:43.590
successful launch of its new product line
options A, marginally B, significantly

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:50.790
C, slightly D minimally understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.100
Solution.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:56.159
Step one, analyze the context.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.409
The sentence clearly states that the
increase in profits is thanks to the

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:04.050
successful launch of its new product line.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:09.300
Successful launch implies a positive
and substantial impact, right.

00:18:09.774 --> 00:18:14.574
We are looking for a word that reflects
a big increase, not a small one.

00:18:15.235 --> 00:18:17.635
Step two, evaluate the options.

00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:23.725
A marginally means to a very small
extent, like a tiny whisper of an

00:18:23.725 --> 00:18:27.804
increase that doesn't really fit
with a successful launch does it?

00:18:28.254 --> 00:18:33.324
B significantly means in a
sufficiently great or important

00:18:33.324 --> 00:18:35.695
way as to be worthy of attention.

00:18:36.175 --> 00:18:37.044
This aligns.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.110
Perfectly with the idea of a successful
launch, bringing in good results.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.820
This sounds promising.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.360
C slightly is similar to marginally.

00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:50.030
It also suggests a small increase.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.840
Nope.

00:18:51.139 --> 00:18:55.219
D minimally means to the
smallest degree possible.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.330
This again, contradicts the
positive outcome expected from

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.070
a successful product launch.

00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:03.584
Step three, select the best fit.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:09.040
The word significantly best describes
the substantial increase in profits

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.730
that would naturally result from
a successful product launch.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.920
It's like hitting a six in cricket,
not a single run, but a big score.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.400
Correct answer is option B. Thank you.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.170
See you in the next lecture.
