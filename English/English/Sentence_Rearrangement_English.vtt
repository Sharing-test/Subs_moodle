Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on sentence rearrangement.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.170
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.380
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.840
So what is this sentence?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.860
Rearrangement, or as we
lovingly call it, para jumbles?

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.300
Are it simple?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.120
It's like a jigsaw puzzle with sentences.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.880
You get a bunch of sentences all mixed
up looking like a plate of biani where

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.189
someone forgot to layer it properly.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.380
Your job is to arrange them in the
correct order to make a sensible

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.300
grammatically sound paragraph.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:44.345
The goal is to find the logical
flow that tells a clear story

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.684
or presents a coherent idea.

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:53.405
This whole exercise is a test of your
brain's wiring for logic, vocabulary, and

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:56.795
of course grammar, real world relevance.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.515
Now you might think, sir,
where will I use this?

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:02.255
Everywhere, my friend?

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:03.215
Everywhere.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:07.595
In any professional role, clear
communication is the king.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:12.515
Whether you're drafting a report that
your boss will actually read, trying to.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.850
Understand a complicated document
or just sending an email that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.410
doesn't confuse everyone.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.300
This skill is vital.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.280
Mastering sentence rearrangement
makes your brain faster at spotting

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.350
and building logical arguments.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.910
It's the secret source for
effective communication and making

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.010
decisions that don't backfire.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.250
Breakdown of question types Based on what
we've seen in past exams, the questions

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.620
come in a few predictable flavors.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.690
A big chunk of questions about 40% will
have a fixed first or last sentence here.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.979
They give you a head start by
fixing one piece of the puzzle.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.530
Then there's complete rearrangement about
30% of the time where they throw all

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.229
the sentences at you and say, good luck.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.380
You have to build the
whole thing from scratch.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.930
Sometimes, maybe 15% of the
time, you'll find an odd one out.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.000
You arrange the paragraph and find
that one sentence is a gate crasher.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.650
It just doesn't belong.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.440
You have to identify that troublemaker.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.959
A smaller portion of questions
involve sentence connectors

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.280
where you find the right word to
stitch two sentences together.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.649
And finally, you might see a
theme-based rearrangement where all

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.875
sentences are about one topic and you
have to build the theme logically.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:44.625
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:47.445
All right, let's talk strategy.

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:52.755
The secret weapons first, always
identify the opening sentence.

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:55.635
Look for a sentence
that stands on its own.

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:59.445
A general statement introducing
a topic or a person.

00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:05.565
If a sentence starts with, but so
he it, they, or therefore, it's

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:10.215
probably not the opener unless it's
very clearly referring to something.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.204
Next look for concluding sentences.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.045
These are the grand finales
summarizing everything.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:22.204
They often use words like finally,
in conclusion or as a result.

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:27.095
Then the most powerful trick,
identify mandatory pairs.

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:28.994
Find two sentences that are.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.325
Inseparable like soulmates.

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.975
This could be a cause and effect
link or a pronoun like he referring

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:37.894
to a name in the previous sentence.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:44.045
Connectors and transition words like
however, therefore, moreover, firstly,

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:46.204
and then are your best friends.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:48.215
They are giant signposts.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.214
Telling you where to go next.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:55.434
If the paragraph is about events,
look for a chronological order using

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:58.285
dates or words like earlier and later.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:02.904
And finally, ensure the theme
and subject consistency remains

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:04.885
solid throughout a sudden.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:07.584
Jump in topic means
you've made a wrong turn.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.750
Methods of solving.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.649
So how do you actually
solve it in the exam hall?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.680
First, read all sentences carefully
get a feel for the story, the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.659
main masala of the paragraph.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.979
Then identify the opening sentence, the
one that sets the stage after that hunt

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.380
for those connecting words and phrases.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.940
Look for pronouns.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:36.715
Conjunctions and transition
words that act like glue.

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:41.515
This will help you form logical
pairs, grouping sentences that

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.195
have a clear relationship.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.094
If it's a story, establish
chronological order.

00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:47.544
Make sure.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.460
All your arranged sentences
stick to one coherent theme.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.080
Once you have a sequence, verify
the grammatical flow by reading

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.219
it in your head, does it sound
smooth or like a bumpy road?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.120
And the most important
method, eliminate options.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.920
Once you find a definite pair or
the opening sentence, look at the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.230
options and mercilessly strike out
the ones that don't fit shortcuts.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.150
Plus smart techniques for those who
like to work smart, not just hard.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.920
Here are some shortcuts.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.520
Option elimination is your
number one time saver.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.390
Find one correct pair and
you might eliminate two or

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.370
three wrong options instantly.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.565
Also try scanning for keywords.

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:39.665
Look for repeated nouns or specific
terms that link sentences together.

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:46.115
The pronoun reference check is a classic
if a sentence has it, or they find the

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:50.825
preceding sentence with the noun it
reference to boom, you have a pair.

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:53.555
I also like the story approach.

00:05:53.914 --> 00:05:56.735
Just treat the sentences
like a short film.

00:05:57.094 --> 00:05:58.295
What's the first scene?

00:05:58.505 --> 00:05:59.825
What happens next?

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:06.185
This intuitive method often works
wonders, and if you are truly stuck, use

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:08.555
trial and error with the given options.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:13.805
Plug in the sentences from an option and
see if it makes a sensible paragraph.

00:06:14.045 --> 00:06:19.685
It's often faster than building from
zero common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:23.435
Now let's talk about the
traps people fall into.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.570
A common mistake is ignoring transition
words, missing a however or thus is like

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.360
missing a giant U-turn sign on the road.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.390
Another classic blunder is misidentifying
the opening sentence by picking

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.610
one that starts with a pronoun.

00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:47.895
Many friends focus only on grammar, but
a grammatically perfect sentence can

00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:50.265
still be in the wrong logical place.

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.725
It's about the flow of ideas.

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:57.345
A big one is not reading the
entire arranged paragraph.

00:06:57.345 --> 00:07:02.715
At the end, you must do a final check
to see if it all holds together.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.010
Also don't assume every
paragraph is about time.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.700
Some are logical arguments, so assuming
chronological order always is a mistake.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.350
Lastly, don't just look at the
first or last word of a sentence.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.450
The whole context matters.

00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:23.265
WH framework summary.

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:25.604
Let's quickly summarize this.

00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:27.164
So what is it?

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:31.664
It's reordering jumble sentences
into a coherent paragraph.

00:07:32.174 --> 00:07:33.555
And why do we do this?

00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:37.005
To test your logical
reasoning and comprehension.

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:38.625
When is it applied?

00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:42.554
When sentences are out of
order and need to be arranged

00:07:42.554 --> 00:07:45.195
sequentially, where will you find it?

00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:50.085
It's a common feature in the English
section of various competitive exams.

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:51.485
Who needs it?

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:54.695
Well, any friend
preparing for these exams.

00:07:55.145 --> 00:07:56.495
And how do you solve it?

00:07:56.885 --> 00:08:02.795
By finding the opener, making pairs, using
transition words and ensuring the theme

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:06.485
is consistent, fully worked out examples.

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:08.705
All right, theory is over.

00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:11.735
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.280
Example, one question.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.780
Arrange the following
sentences, A, B, C, and D.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.630
To form a coherent paragraph A, the
internet has revolutionized how we

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.210
access information and communicate.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.760
B, this digital transformation has
also brought about new challenges

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:38.855
such as cybersecurity threats, c. It
allows for instant global connectivity

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.075
and access to vast knowledge.

00:08:41.495 --> 00:08:47.825
D. Despite these challenges, its benefits
far outweigh the drawbacks options.

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:57.694
A A, CB, DB, CADB, CAB, CD,
DC, BAD understand the question

00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:59.525
before moving to explanation.

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.025
Let's break it down.

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:03.875
Step one, the opening sentence.

00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:08.705
Sentence A introduces the main
topic, the Internet's impact.

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:11.765
It's a general statement,
a perfect opener.

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:15.245
Step two, what follows a sentence?

00:09:15.245 --> 00:09:20.585
C Explains how it revolutionized
and it clearly refers to the

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:22.325
internet from sentence A.

00:09:22.535 --> 00:09:24.575
So we have the pair ac.

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:25.765
Step three.

00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:26.905
What's next?

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:31.945
After talking about the good stuff,
sentence B introduces a contrast.

00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:36.955
The challenges of this transformation,
this fits logically after discussing

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:42.565
the positives, step four, the
conclusion sentence D wraps it all up.

00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:47.365
It acknowledges the challenges from
B with despite these challenges and

00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:53.755
gives a final verdict, so the complete
logical sequences, A, then C, then B.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.080
And finally, D, the correct option is
A, A, C, B, D. Example, two question.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.440
Arrange the following sentences, A, B,
C, and D to form a coherent paragraph

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.020
A. Therefore, maintaining a balanced
diet is crucial for overall wellbeing.

00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:18.665
B, eating habits significantly impact
one's health and energy levels.

00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:24.215
C. C Processed foods high in
sugar and unhealthy fats can

00:10:24.215 --> 00:10:26.105
lead to various health issues.

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:31.685
D on the upper hand, a diet rich in
fruits, vegetables, and whole grains

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:34.805
provides essential nutrients options.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:44.005
A, B, C, A, D, B, B, C, DA, C, D,
B, C. A. DA, B, D, C understand the

00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:46.375
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:46.675 --> 00:10:47.814
Let's solve this one.

00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:53.814
Step one, the opening sentence has to
be B. It's a broad, general statement

00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:55.915
about eating habits and health.

00:10:56.185 --> 00:11:00.535
Step two, now we need to
elaborate on this impact sentence.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.694
C talks about the negative side.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.880
Processed foods.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.680
Sentence D presents the positive
side using the connector on the

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.780
other hand, which directly contrasts
with C, so CD is a mandatory pair.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.970
Step three, this CD pair explains
the impact mentioned in sentence

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.825
B, so the sequence starts with B,
C, D, step four, the conclusion.

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:28.795
Sentence A starts with therefore,
which is a big clue for a conclusion.

00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:33.055
It summarizes the whole point
that a balanced diet is important.

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:37.105
So the correct order is BCDA.

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:41.186
The correct option is B-B-C-D-A.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.410
Example three question.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.930
Arrange the following sentences,
A, B, C, and D to form a coherent

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.690
paragraph A. This led to a significant
increase in agricultural productivity.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.270
B. The green revolution initiated
in the mid 20th century aimed to

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.010
boost food production globally.

00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:06.695
C. It involved the adoption of
high yielding varieties of crops,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:09.425
improved irrigation and fertilizers.

00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:14.045
D. However, it also raised
concerns about environmental

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.895
impact and sustainability options.

00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:26.255
A B, CA, DB, BA, DC, C, C, BD, DA,
B, D, C understand the question

00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:28.025
before moving to explanation.

00:12:28.325 --> 00:12:29.885
Let's crack this final one.

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:34.925
Step one, the opening sentence
is clearly B. It introduces

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:37.055
our hero, the green revolution.

00:12:37.325 --> 00:12:39.395
Step two, what did it do?

00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:43.505
Sentence C explains the methods
used in the green revolution.

00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:48.305
The IT in C refers back to the
green revolution in B. So we

00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:50.875
have the pair BC. Step three.

00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:53.125
What was the result of these methods?

00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:55.645
Sentence A tells us the result.

00:12:55.915 --> 00:12:59.935
This led to a significant increase
in agricultural productivity.

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:06.060
This refers to the methods in C, so
our sequence is now B, C, A. Step

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:11.520
four, the twist in the story sentence
D starts with, however, introducing

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.560
a negative point or a concern.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.580
This is the perfect contrasting
talk to follow the success story.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.370
So the full sequence is B, C,
A, and D. The correct option

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.310
is A, B, C, A, D. Thank you.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.230
See you in the next lecture.
