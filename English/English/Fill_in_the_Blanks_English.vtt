Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Fill in the Blanks.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.740
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept, explanation.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.390
Fill in the blanks, my friend,
are a common feature in English

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.625
language sections of competitive
exams, like your very own exam.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:25.884
In these questions, you are presented
with a sentence or a passage with words

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:28.645
missing indicated by a blank space.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:35.035
Your task to choose the most appropriate
word or phrase from the given options

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:40.435
to complete the sentence, it must be
grammatically correct, contextually

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.435
relevant, and logically sound you see?

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:48.430
These questions primarily test
your vocabulary, your grammar,

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:50.830
and your comprehension skills.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.989
Real world relevance.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.839
Why bother with fill
in the blanks you ask.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.900
Ah, precision in language is absolutely
crucial for clear communication.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.039
These skills enhance your ability
to understand and formulate

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.080
accurate financial reports,
client communications and internal

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.750
documents, minimizing ambiguity.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.370
No one should say aray.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.695
What did he mean by that?

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:20.134
Think about it my friend.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.684
It's about report accuracy.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:28.774
Ensuring financial reports are sound
and precise For client communication,

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:33.905
you craft clear emails and
statements for policy interpretation.

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:37.024
It's accurately understanding regulations.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.309
In loan documentation, you fill forms
with correct terminology For internal

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:49.220
memos, you write concise communications,
and with compliance documents you

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.065
ensure all legal papers are error free.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.760
See it's practical
breakdown of question types.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.710
Now let's speak at the different flavors
of fill in the blanks questions you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.140
might encounter in your English section.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.210
They primarily assess your
vocabulary, grammar, and contextual

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.090
understanding based on past patterns.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.250
The recurring formats include.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.660
First single blanks, around 60 to
70% are your classic single blanks.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.790
Here, one word is missing.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.880
Your mission is to choose the option that
fits best grammatically and contextually.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.890
Next double blanks.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.800
These make up about 20 to 30%.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.470
Two words are missing from a sentence.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.370
You select a pair that
correctly fills both blanks.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.750
Both must fit.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.370
It's a package deal.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
Then sentence completion
about five to 10%.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.780
Sometimes the entire
sentence is incomplete.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.760
You choose the option that best
completes it, often testing idioms

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.040
phrases or complex structures.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.040
Finally though, less frequent
passage based blanks.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.570
A short passage might have blanks.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.560
You fill them based on the
overall theme and context

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.780
requiring strong comprehension.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.400
It's like understanding the
whole movie formulas and tricks.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.920
All right, my friend, listen up.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.380
No mathematical formulas here.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.140
No, A squared plus B squared, sorry.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.480
But systematic approaches and clever
tricks exist to boost your accuracy.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.170
First contextual clues.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
Always read the entire sentence
or paragraph to grasp the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.350
overall meaning and tone.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.120
Surrounding words are like little
spies providing crucial clues.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.320
Don't rush.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.480
Then grammar rules.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.000
Pay close attention to the sentences.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.270
Grammatical structure is the blank, asking
for a verb, noun, adjective, or adverb.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.200
This helps eliminate options
that don't fit grammatically.

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:00.915
And of course, vocabulary power.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.155
A strong vocabulary is your superpower.

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:10.005
If you know the meanings of options, you
can quickly spot the best word regularly.

00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.915
Learn new words, synonyms and antonyms.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:14.625
Build your word army.

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:17.144
Use the elimination method.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:18.435
If unsure.

00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:20.954
Eliminate options that are clearly wrong.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:25.065
This clever trick immediately
boosts your chances from the rest.

00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:27.285
Play smart, not just hard.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.525
Consider positive or negative connotation.

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:34.364
Determine if the sentence
needs a word with a positive,

00:04:34.484 --> 00:04:36.284
negative, or neutral vibe.

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:40.695
This helps narrow down options,
especially when words have similar

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:43.155
meanings but different emotional impacts.

00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:45.554
Don't forget colocations.

00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:50.234
Some words just naturally go
together like chai and samosa.

00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:54.614
Recognizing these common word
friendships, like make a decision

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:59.174
or take a risk, helps you choose
the most natural and correct word.

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:05.804
And finally, a hack, prefixes and
suffixes, understanding common prefixes

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:08.835
and suffixes.

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:16.325
LY can help you guess the meaning, a
grammatical function of unfamiliar words,

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:19.640
a secret decoding methods of solving.

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:21.825
All right, my friend.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:27.705
Let's get down to the brass tacks, the
step-by-step methods for tackling these.

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:31.065
Fill in the blanks problems
like a true champion.

00:05:31.725 --> 00:05:35.175
First, read the sentence
or passage completely.

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.875
Before you even glance at options.

00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:43.695
Read the entire sentence or passage to
grasp the overall meaning and context.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.585
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.185
Next, identify the type of word needed.

00:05:49.664 --> 00:05:54.674
Figure out the grammatical role of
the missing word, eeg, noun, verb.

00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:55.604
A objective.

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:58.875
This can be inferred
from surrounding words.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.515
It's like finding the
missing puzzle piece.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:09.145
Then predict a suitable word, optional but
recommended based on context and grammar.

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:13.285
Try to think of a word that
would naturally fit This.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:16.945
Pre-analysis helps evaluate
options effectively.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.855
After that, examine the options.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:22.315
Look at all provided options.

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:26.095
Consider their meanings,
forms, and connotations.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.330
Don't rush.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.320
Now, substitute each option mentally.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.600
Insert each option into the blank.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.270
Read the complete sentence with each.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.100
This checks grammatical, correctness,
and contextual appropriateness.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.600
Does it make sense?

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:45.625
Always check for contextual fit.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:50.275
Ensure your chosen word makes
perfect logical sense within the

00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:52.195
sentence and broader passage.

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:54.865
It shouldn't just be
grammatically correct.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.475
It must convey the intended meaning.

00:06:58.045 --> 00:07:00.265
Consider nuances and idioms.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:03.985
Some questions might test
subtle differences between

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:05.755
synonyms or common idioms.

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:11.045
Choose the word that best captures the
precise meaning or completes the idiom.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.719
And finally, eliminate incorrect options.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.060
Systematically rule out options that
are grammatically incorrect, irrelevant,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.520
or illogical If stuck between two,
reevaluate their subtle differences.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.000
For double blanks, apply the same process.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.450
Find a pair where both
words fit perfectly.

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:37.864
If one word in a pair clearly doesn't
fit, eliminate that entire option.

00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:42.215
Focusing on one blank first can
narrow choices for the other.

00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:47.765
It's like finding one matching sock
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:49.655
All right, my friend.

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:54.275
Let's talk about some smart shortcuts
that save precious exam time.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.870
First read around the blank.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.000
Focus intensely on words immediately
before and after the blank.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.290
These are often your best
friends providing strong cues.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.469
Second, check for agreement.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.330
Ensure your chosen word agrees with
the subject in number and tense.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.890
If a verb or with the noun, it
modifies no mismatched bears.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.700
Third look for parallelism in
sentences with lists or comparisons.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.710
Look for parallel structures.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.030
If one part uses a certain form,
the missing word, often follow suit.

00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:36.795
Fourth, identify keywords.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:43.485
Certain keywords act like signboards,
although, but suggest contrast because

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:46.515
since suggest cause pay attention.

00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:49.275
Fifth, use root words.

00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:55.545
If you see an unfamiliar option, try
to identify its root, prefix or suffix.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:59.175
This helps in firm, meaning
it's like a mini puzzle.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.230
Sixth speed reading and skimming
for passage based blanks.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.670
Practice speed reading.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.960
To grasp the main idea and
context quickly, it saves time.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.540
Seventh, trust your ear.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.450
Sometimes a word just sounds right or
wrong, while not foolproof, developing an

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.090
ear for correct English usage is helpful.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.850
It's like knowing a song is off key.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.694
Eighth, don't overthink if
stuck between two options.

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:31.995
Go with your first instinct
after quick analysis.

00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:36.435
Spending too much time on one
question eats into time for others.

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:40.694
Move on common mistakes
and misconceptions.

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:46.094
Now my friend, let's talk about
the pitfalls, the common mistakes

00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:50.329
friends often make so you can
avoid them like a bad date.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.569
Mistake number one, ignoring context.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.729
A common error is picking a
grammatically correct word that doesn't

00:09:59.729 --> 00:10:02.069
fit the overall meaning or tone.

00:10:02.729 --> 00:10:06.569
Always read the entire
sentence and surrounding ones.

00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:08.525
Context is king.

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:12.515
Mistake number two, vocabulary traps.

00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:17.105
Options might include similar
words with subtle differences

00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:19.085
in connotation or usage.

00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:23.314
Be wary my friend, and
choose the most precise word.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.079
Mistake number three, grammar oversights.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.459
Friends often overlook basic
rules like subject verb

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:33.680
agreement or tense consistency.

00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:35.449
Always double check.

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:36.560
Grammatical fit.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.910
Don't be lazy.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.870
Mistake number four,
over reliance on sound.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.910
Choosing a word simply because it
sounds right can be misleading.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.040
Intuition helps, but back it with
solid grammar and vocabulary.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.090
Mistake number five.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.190
Not reading all options.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.800
The first option that seems correct.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.540
Might not be the best.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.290
Always read through all
choices before deciding.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.390
No premature conclusions.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.280
Mistake number six,
misinterpreting idioms of phrases.

00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:16.275
If the blank is part of an idiom,
misinterpreting, it leads to error.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:19.995
Familiarize yourself with
common English idioms.

00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:25.395
Mistake number seven, rushing through
double blanks for double blanks.

00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:28.665
Friends, sometimes
focus only on the first.

00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:31.905
Both words in the pair must be correct.

00:11:32.145 --> 00:11:33.435
It's a team effort.

00:11:33.885 --> 00:11:35.745
WH framework Summary.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.290
All right, my friend.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.510
Let's quickly sum up this concept
using our classic WH framework.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.090
So what are these questions?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.320
They require?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.890
Selecting words or phrases
to complete sentences.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:50.880
And why do we learn them?

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.510
They test vocabulary, grammar,
and contextual understanding.
