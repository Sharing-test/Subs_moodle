00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on synonyms and ANMs.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.550
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.450
This is it.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.105
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.595
So what are synonyms you ask?

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.725
Well, my friend, they're like two
best friends who always agree they

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:24.075
are words that have the same or nearly
the same meaning as another word.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.415
Think of happy and joyful.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:32.445
Perfectly in sync, just like a well
coordinated dance number and antonyms.

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:35.355
Ah, they're the complete opposite.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:41.235
Like a typical Indian soap opera duo
always at loggerheads, they are words that

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.364
have opposite meanings to another word.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:46.095
For example, hot and cold.

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:48.614
Can't get more opposite than that, right?

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:54.539
Understanding these two types is
super crucial, almost as important as

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.114
knowing your chai from your coffee,
for expanding your vocabulary and

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:01.214
truly improving your comprehension.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:03.145
And expression in English.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:05.185
Real world relevance.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:09.775
Now, why should you and aspiring
professional care about this?

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:12.445
For someone looking to crack your exam?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.295
Precise communication is paramount.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.315
Whether you are drafting official
documents or interacting with

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.565
clients, every word counts.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:22.930
Just like every root.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.610
Be in a bank account.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.800
A strong grasp of synonyms and
antonyms enhances your ability to

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.930
choose the most accurate words.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.790
This ensures absolute clarity
and professionalism in all your

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.560
communications and reports.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.590
No more confuse your
meter going off my friend.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:46.565
Breakdown of question types
in your exam and other exams.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:52.505
Synonyms and antonyms questions primarily
appear in a few interesting formats each

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:54.995
designed to test your lexical prowess.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:02:01.175
First up, the direct synonyms or antonyms
type, which is about 50% frequent.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.275
This is the most straightforward, like
a direct question about your last meal.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.445
You are given a word and simply
ask to choose its synonym or

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.394
anm from a list of a. Options.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.524
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:20.765
Next we have sentence based synonyms
or antonyms with about 30% frequency.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:25.415
Here a sentence is provided with
a word highlighted or underlined.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:30.515
Your job is to identify its synonym
or antonym based on how it's

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:31.475
used in that specific context.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.204
This tests your contextual
understanding, just like figuring out

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.364
if butter means the dairy product.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.130
Or something else in a phrase
like butter up then comes fill in

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.859
the blanks, roughly 15% frequent.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.960
You are given a sentence with a blank, and
you need to choose a word from the options

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.480
that either acts as a synonym or antonym
to another word already in the sentence.

00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:02.045
Or fits the context while being a
synonym or antonym of a given word.

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:06.965
It's like finding the missing piece
of a jigsaw puzzle, but with words.

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:12.575
Finally, the odd one out with a
low but significant 5% frequency.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:17.584
In this type, a group of words is
given and you need to identify the one

00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:21.785
word that doesn't fit the synonym or
anonym relationship with the others.

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:25.834
It's like finding the one person
at a party who doesn't know the

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:27.575
latest Bollywood dance step.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.760
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.220
Now for the mantras or the smart
strategies, because let's be honest,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.920
there are no mathematical formulas for
word meanings, but these strategies act

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.320
as effective tricks for success, almost
like your grandmother's secret recipe.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.260
Always use contextual clues.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.160
Please, my friend, always
read the entire sentence or

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.260
passage where the word appears.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.579
The surrounding words often provide
crucial clues to the meaning

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.960
of the target word, helping you
determine its synonym or antonym.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.515
It's like knowing the whole story to
understand one character's actions.

00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:14.565
Understanding root words, prefixes
and suffixes is a superpower.

00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:20.955
Knowing common Latin and Greek root
words along with prefixes like ri

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:27.255
anti and suffixes like tation ology,
can help you deduce the meaning

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.745
of even the most unfamiliar words.

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:32.355
It's like having a decoder
ring for vocabulary.

00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:36.315
The elimination technique
is your best friend.

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:41.055
When in doubt, if you are unsure of
the exact meaning, simply eliminate

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:43.275
options that are clearly incorrect.

00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:48.015
This dramatically increases your
chances of selecting the right answer.

00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:52.375
Even if you have to play, guess the
answer like a true Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.135
Remember part of speech matching?

00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:58.375
This is basic, my friend,
but often overlooked.

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:03.475
The synonym or antonym must be the
same part of speech as the given word.

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:07.315
If the given word is a verb,
it's synonym or antonym.

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:10.855
Must also be a verb, no
noun, verb, confusion.

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:14.035
Please pay attention to degree of meaning.

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:16.465
Words aren't always black and white.

00:05:16.674 --> 00:05:18.174
They have shades of gray.

00:05:18.474 --> 00:05:23.304
For example, a synonym for happy
could be joyful, stronger intensity

00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:25.885
or content, milder intensity.

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:28.435
Antonyms also have varying degrees.

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:29.965
It's about finding the.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.429
Perfect shade, not just any shade.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.909
Remember positive or negative connotation.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.690
Figure out if the given word
has a positive, negative,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.219
or neutral connotation.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.840
Its synonym will likely have a
similar connotation while its antonym

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.640
will of course have the opposite.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.250
This is a quick wipe check for words.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.609
And finally, practice with word lists.

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:54.539
Regularly.

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.715
Study high frequency word
lists for competitive exams.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.710
Focus on understanding their meanings
and common synonyms and antonyms.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.170
This is your vocabulary, Jim, my friend.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.090
Consistency is key.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.360
Methods of solving here are distinct
approaches, like different paths to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.850
the same destination, to effectively
solve synonyms and antonyms problems.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.730
First, the direct recall method.

00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:26.355
For words you've seen a million
times, you might directly recall

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:30.405
their synonyms or antonyms from
your vast vocabulary knowledge.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:36.525
This is the fastest method your express
train to the answer, but it relies

00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:38.835
heavily on your prior learning, of course.

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:43.915
When a word is in a sentence, use
the contextual analysis method.

00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:48.955
Read the entire sentence carefully
like you're reading a secret message.

00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:53.155
Analyze how the word is used
in that specific context.

00:06:53.605 --> 00:06:58.285
The surrounding words and the overall
meaning of the sentence will often provide

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:03.715
strong clues to the words, meaning helping
you identify its synonym or antonym.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:07.045
Next, the root word and effects analysis.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.510
Break down unfamiliar words into their
root words, prefixes and suffixes.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.920
Understanding the meaning of these
small components can help you deduce

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.450
the meaning of the whole word, and
subsequently its synonym or antonym.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.575
It's like dismantling a complex
machine to understand its parts.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.090
Always use elimination by part of speech.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.409
Ensure that the chosen synonym
or antonym matches the part

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.909
of speech of the given word.

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:40.340
If the given word is a noun, its
synonym or antonym must also be a noun.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.090
Eliminate options that just
don't match the part of speech.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.190
No square pegs in round holes.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.520
Please do a connotation
and denotation check.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.870
Consider both the literal meaning
denotation and the emotional

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.669
association connotation.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.310
A synonym should ideally match both.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.290
While an antonym should have an opposite
denotation and often an opposite

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.540
connotation, it's about understanding the
feel of the word, not just its dictionary

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.850
definition and a super effective one for
sentence based questions, the substitution

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:19.105
method, try substituting each option into
the sentence in place of the given word.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.289
Read the sentence with the substituted
word to see if it makes sense and

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:28.729
maintains the original meaning for
synonyms or creates an opposite meaning.

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:32.900
For antonyms, it's like trying
on different clothes to see which

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.000
one fits best, shortcuts and
smart techniques to quickly tackle

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.220
synonyms and antonyms questions.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:45.380
Employ these smart techniques, which
are basically your jugar for exams.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.990
Eliminate obvious mismatches right away.

00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:54.479
Quickly scan the options and eliminate
any words that are clearly unrelated in

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:57.360
meaning or are a different part of speech.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.370
Time is money, my friend.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.709
Look for word families.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.699
Often words from the same
root or family will appear.

00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:10.875
Understanding one word in the family can
help you deduce the meaning of others.

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:15.615
It's like knowing one family member
helps you understand the whole clan.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:21.975
Use positive negative association if you
can determine whether the given word has

00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:24.615
a positive or negative connotation, you.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.140
Often eliminate options that have
the opposite connotation when looking

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.670
for a synonym or the same connotation
when looking for an antonym.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.060
This is your quick sentiment
analysis for words.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.790
Always consider nuances.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.270
Sometimes multiple options
might seem similar.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.980
Pay attention to the subtle differences in
meaning and choose the word that is the.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.320
Closest or most precise fit.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.390
It's like distinguishing between
good and superb, both positive but

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.910
different degrees for antonyms.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.470
Try the reverse check.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.850
If you are looking for an antonym
first, think of a synonym for the given

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.500
word, and then try to find the opposite
of that synonym among the options.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.640
This can sometimes simplify the
process like taking a scenic route

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.490
to avoid traffic, and of course.

00:10:15.675 --> 00:10:20.234
Practice with flashcards, create
flashcards with words on one side

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:24.405
and their synonyms or antonyms
on the other regular revision.

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:29.415
Helps in quick recall during the exam,
just like memorizing cricket Stats.

00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:31.275
Finally read widely.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:37.610
The more you read newspapers, magazines,
books, the more exposure you get to a

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.350
wide range of vocabulary in different
contexts, which naturally improves your

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.530
ability to identify synonyms and antonyms.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.210
It's like getting a free language
course just by enjoying your reading.

00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:53.255
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:58.205
Be aware of these common errors,
my friend, to avoid losing

00:10:58.205 --> 00:11:01.085
marks because every mark counts.

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:04.564
Just like every run in a T 20 match.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:12.150
A very frequent mistake is ignoring
context, choosing a synonym or antonym

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.340
based on its general meaning without
considering how the word is used in

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.680
the specific sentence or passage.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.440
Remember, words can have multiple
meanings, just like a single person can

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.080
play multiple roles in a family drama.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.980
Mismatching part of speech is another
culprit selecting an option that is not

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.590
the same part of speech as the given word.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.430
For example, choosing a noun
when a verb is required.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.330
This is like trying to fit a
square peg in a round hole.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.420
Confusing synonyms with antonyms
and vice versa happens a

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.370
lot when you are in a hurry.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.030
Candidates might mistakenly
choose a synonym when an

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.520
antonym is asked or vice versa.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.310
Always double check the
question, my friend.

00:12:03.615 --> 00:12:06.315
Overlooking nuances is also common.

00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:09.855
Many words have similar
meanings, but differ in their

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:12.225
intensity or specific usage.

00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:16.515
Choosing a word that is generally
similar but not the most

00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:18.615
precise fit is a common error.

00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:20.760
Don't settle for almost right.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.380
Lack of vocabulary depth
can lead to trouble.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.050
Relying on a limited vocabulary can lead
to incorrect guesses when encountering

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.360
unfamiliar words or when options
include close, but not exact matches.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.385
Time to expand your word bank.

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:45.030
Misinterpreting prefixes or suffixes
can also mislead you incorrectly.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.829
Understanding the meaning of
prefixes, like Miss dis or Suffixes

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.719
can lead to choosing words with the
opposite intended meaning be careful.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.689
A small prefix can change everything.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.550
And a simple but vital one
not reading all options.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.080
Sometimes the best answer is not
the first one that seems correct.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.220
Always read through all the given
options before making a choice.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.960
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.000
Just like you wouldn't pick a sweet from
the box without seeing all the varieties.

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.625
W Edge Framework summary.

00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:25.935
Let's quickly sum up our discussion
using the famous W Edge framework, like

00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:28.305
a quick recap before the next episode.

00:13:28.755 --> 00:13:30.615
So what are we talking about?

00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:35.475
Words with the same or similar meanings,
which are synonyms and words with

00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:37.694
opposite meanings, which are antonyms.

00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:38.655
Simple, right?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.730
Why is this important?

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.230
It's essential for vocabulary,
expansion, precise communication,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.450
and better overall comprehension.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.960
Basically, it makes you
sound smarter and clearer.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.940
When does this topic appear?

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.870
It's frequently tested in the English
sections of competitive exams.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.490
Like your exam, so no, escaping this one.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.650
Where are these concepts supplied?

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.540
You'll find them in reading comprehension,
vocabulary sections and general

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:09.339
English sections of your exams.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.510
It's everywhere.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.040
Like background music.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.020
Who needs to master this?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.980
Friends, professionals, and
anyone aiming to improve their

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.540
English language proficiency.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.280
That's you my friend.

00:14:21.675 --> 00:14:23.145
And how do you master it?

00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:27.435
By studying word meanings, diligently
understanding their contextual

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:31.845
usage, learning about root words,
and most importantly, practicing

00:14:31.845 --> 00:14:37.365
regularly, no shortcuts to success,
only smart work fully worked out.

00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:38.145
Examples.

00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:42.915
Let's look at some examples now so
you can see all this theory in action.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.040
Example, one synonym question.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.900
Choose the word that is most similar
in meaning to benevolent options.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.910
A, malicious B, generous
C, hostile D. Cruel.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.935
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:00.595
Solution.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:05.935
Step one, understand the word benevolent
means well-meaning and kindly.

00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:08.095
It's like someone with a good heart.

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:10.704
Step two, analyze the options.

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:14.785
A malicious means intending
or intended to do harm.

00:15:14.935 --> 00:15:16.135
This is negative.

00:15:16.405 --> 00:15:21.715
B. Generous means showing a readiness to
give more of something, especially money

00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:24.324
than is strictly necessary or expected.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.125
This implies kindness.

00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:32.035
C Hostile means unfriendly,
antagonistic, definitely negative D.

00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:35.905
Cruel means willfully causing
pain or suffering to others,

00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:37.945
or feeling no concern about it.

00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:39.145
Very negative.

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.575
Step three, select the best fit.

00:15:41.905 --> 00:15:45.835
Generous is the closest in meaning
to benevolent as both imply

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.755
kindness and a willingness to give.

00:15:48.085 --> 00:15:52.255
Just like that kind neighbor who
always shares their homemade suites.

00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:58.444
Correct answer is option B.
Example two antonym question.

00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:05.255
Choose the word that is most opposite
in meaning to ephemeral options.

00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:11.074
A, permanent B, fleeting
C, transient D, momentary.

00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:18.165
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:25.064
Step one, understand the word ephemeral
means lasting for a very short time.

00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:28.575
Think of a fleeting
moment, gone in a blink.

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:31.755
Step two, analyze the options.

00:16:32.175 --> 00:16:38.835
A permanent means lasting or intended to
last or remain unchanged indefinitely.

00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:40.965
This sounds like forever.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.540
B Fleeting means lasting
for a very short time.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.220
This is a synonym.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:52.980
C transient means lasting only
for a short time impermanent.

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:58.860
Another synonym, D. Momentary means
lasting for a very short time.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.540
Yet another synonym.

00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:03.645
Step three, select the best fit.

00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:08.475
Permanent is the direct opposite
of Ephemeral as it signifies

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.335
lasting for a long time.

00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:15.495
It's like the difference between a
Cricket match and a five day test series.

00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:17.985
Correct answer is option A.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:24.240
Example three contextual synonym
question in the sentence.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.890
The DUIs task required immense
concentration and effort.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.890
Choose the word that is most similar
in meaning to arduous options.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.680
A, simple B, easy C, difficult D, trivial.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.410
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.040
Step one, understand the word in context.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.810
The sentence describes the task
as requiring immense concentration

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.280
and effort, which immediately
tells us it was not easy at all.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.235
It sounds like solving a tough Sudoku.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.260
Step two, analyze the options.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.220
A simple means easily understood or done.

00:18:09.399 --> 00:18:09.879
Nope.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:15.850
Opposite vibe B, easy means achieved
without great effort presenting.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.990
Few difficulties, again, the opposite
of what the sentence implies.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.370
C Difficult means needing much
effort or skill to accomplish.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.960
Deal with or understand this
fits perfectly with immense

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.640
concentration and effort.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.990
D, trivial means of little
value or importance.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.950
The sentence doesn't talk about
importance, but about effort.

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:44.985
Step three, select the best
fit based on the context of

00:18:45.045 --> 00:18:47.115
immense concentration and effort.

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:51.015
Difficult is the most similar
in meaning to arduous.

00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:54.075
It was a tough nut to crack indeed.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:55.305
Thank you.

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:56.955
See you in the next lecture.
