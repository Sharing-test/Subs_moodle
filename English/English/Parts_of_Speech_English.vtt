00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.260
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on parts of speech.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.290
palate attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.700
All right, so what exactly
are these parts of speech?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.750
Think of them as the fundamental
building blocks of a sentence.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.660
The little masala
ingredients that give the.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.369
English language, its
flavor and structure.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.800
Understanding them is absolutely crucial
for constructing grammatically correct

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.570
sentences and for comprehending complex
texts without getting a headache.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.600
There are eight main players in this team.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.480
First up is the noun, which is simply
a naming word for a person, place,

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.320
think, idea, quality, or even an action.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.670
Examples include a friend Mumbai, a
book, the idea of freedom, the quality

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.610
of happiness, or the action of swimming.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.370
Next, we have its loyal, sidekick,
the pronoun, a word used in place

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.900
of a noun, basically to stop you
from sounding like a broken record.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.400
Think of he, she, it, they we, you.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.040
I and all their other forms like him, her,
them, us, mine, yours, and even himself.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.740
The verb is the absolute heart of the
sentence, the engine that makes it go.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
It's the word that describes an
action, a state, or an occurrence.

00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:39.714
For example, to run, to eat, to sleep,
or even words like is, seems and become.

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:45.414
Then comes the adjective, which is like
the designer of the sentence, a word that

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:51.054
describes or modifies a noun or pronoun,
giving it more detail and personality.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.960
Words like beautiful, dull,
intelligent, red, quick, and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.030
happy are all a objectives.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.970
The adverb is a true all rounder
modifying a verb, an adjective, another

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.550
adverb, or even a whole sentence.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.070
It tells us how, when, where, why,
or to what extent something is done

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.800
with examples like quickly vary
yesterday here, always and smoothly.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.920
A preposition is a tiny but mighty word
that shows the relationship between a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.230
noun or pronoun and other words often
indicating position, direction, or

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.790
time, like on in at by width and from a
conjunction is the ultimate connector.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.680
The Vic Call of Grammar used to
join words, phrases, or clauses.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.690
Think of and, but.

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:49.265
Or because, and while, and finally
the interjection, this is a

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:53.855
word or phrase for pure sudden
emotion that often stands alone.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:59.825
Like, oh wow, alas or
Bravo, real world relevance.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.680
Now you might be thinking,
ma'am, this is all school stuff.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.970
Why is it important?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.359
Now?

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.459
Listen closely, my friend.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.130
Understanding parts of speech is
absolutely vital as it directly

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.579
impacts your professional
communication and accuracy.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.790
It ensures total clarity when you
are drafting official documents and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.410
reports, which is mission critical
for financial and legal precision.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.750
It also aids in the precise
interpretation of complicated policies

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.240
and regulations preventing very costly
misunderstandings in critical operations.

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:43.075
This knowledge enables you to have
effective and grammatically sound

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.945
communication with your clients
and colleagues, which is how you

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:49.195
foster trust and professionalism.

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:54.985
It is essential for drafting the clear
and concise emails and memos that

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:59.035
are a daily, unavoidable requirement
in a professional environment.

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:04.265
It also helps you in identifying
and correcting your own grammatical

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:08.165
errors in written communication,
which is key to maintaining high

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.905
standards of professionalism.

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:11.495
And here's a surprise.

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:16.115
It even supports logical and
structured thinking, a skill that

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:20.430
translates directly into better
problem solving abilities on the job.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:26.534
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:31.185
Questions on this topic primarily
appear in a few predictable formats.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:36.315
The undisputed champion, the one you
will see most often with a frequency

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:39.525
of 35 to 40% is error spotting.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:44.685
This is where you have to play detective
and identify the part of the sentence

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:46.905
that contains a grammatical error.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.200
Very often related to the incorrect
usage of a part of speech, like using

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.450
an adjective instead of an adverb.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.430
The next most common format
appearing about 25 to 30% of

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.410
the time is fill in the blanks.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.210
Here you'll need to choose the most
appropriate word to complete a sentence,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.830
ensuring it is both grammatically
correct and makes sense in the context.

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.330
Then we have sentence improvement
or correction, which shows up

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.120
in about 20 to 25% of questions.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.770
In this type, you must replace an
underlined part of a sentence with a

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.390
grammatically superior alternative,
often requiring knowledge of proper word

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.360
forms like word tenses or pronoun cases.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.220
Lastly, there is phrase replacement,
which is similar to sentence improvement

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.950
and appears 10 to 15% of the time.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.380
It focuses on replacing an entire phrase
to correct grammatical errors or to

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.570
improve the overall sentence structure.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.760
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.700
Here are some key tricks and tips.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.540
Your secret weapons to identify and
correctly use parts of speech for nouns.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.830
Always look for words that
can be proceeded by articles

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.355
like a and or the or.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.280
Possessive pronouns like my or your.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.310
For pronouns, you must always check
if the pronoun agrees with the noun.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.320
It replaces in terms of number
and gender, and please pay

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.270
close attention to its case.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.240
Subjective, like I objective,
like me or possessive like my.

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:33.235
For verbs, your job is to identify
the action or state of being, and

00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:38.035
then double check for subject verb
agreement and correct tense usage.

00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:45.535
Adverbs are often easy to spot as many
end in LY, like quickly or carefully.

00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:49.045
They describe verbs or
adjectives and answer.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.675
How, when or where.

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:57.345
Prepositions are typically followed
by a noun or pronoun forming what

00:06:57.345 --> 00:07:01.305
we call a prepositional phrase,
and they show relationships

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.645
of time, place, or direction.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.615
Conjunctions are the great joiners.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:11.565
Look for words that connect similar
grammatical units, especially the

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:16.965
famous fanboy for and nor but or yet.

00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:17.835
And so.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.549
And interjections.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.469
They are the dramatic ones, usually
followed by an exclamation mark

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.330
and expressing strong sudden
emotion methods of solving.

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:35.090
When tackling questions related to parts
of speech, please employ these systematic

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.489
approaches instead of just guessing.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.150
First, always perform
a contextual analysis.

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.469
Read the entire sentence carefully
to grasp its full meaning.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.030
The context often dictates which part
of speech is required and what specific

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.099
word choice is most appropriate.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.400
This is your first and
most important clue.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.909
Second, do a sentence
structure examination.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.030
Analyze the grammatical structure by
identifying the subject, verb and object.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.460
Determine if a modifying word is needed
for a noun, which would be an adjective.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:17.680
Or for a verb, which would be an adverb
next, for multiple choice questions, use

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.480
the elimination method systematically
rule out options that are clearly

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.030
incorrect based on grammatical rules.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.980
This narrows down your choices and
hugely increases your probability

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.240
of selecting the correct answer.

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:36.734
You can also use the substitution
test if you are ever unsure.

00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:41.084
Try substituting each option
into the blank or the error

00:08:41.084 --> 00:08:42.554
prone part of the sentence.

00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:46.844
Read the sentence aloud with
each option to check if it sounds

00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:48.944
grammatically correct and logical.

00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.704
Finally, of course, is
grammar rule application.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:56.335
Consciously apply the specific
rules for each part of speech.

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:58.525
If it's an error spotting question.

00:08:58.675 --> 00:09:02.995
Check for things like subject verb
agreement, correct pronoun case,

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:08.485
and the proper use of prepositions
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.470
To save that precious time and
improve your accuracy during the exam.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.830
Consider these shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.620
First, use suffex clues.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.200
Many words have common suffixes that are
dead giveaways of their part of speech.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.780
Nouns often end in teon.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Meant ness or it adjectives frequently
end in able, able, full or o. And

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.520
adverbs, as you know, love to end in LY.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.969
Also, look at the
position in the sentence.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:48.495
The typical placement of a word
can hint at its part of speech.

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:53.745
Adjectives usually come before
nouns and adverbs can appear in

00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:57.885
various positions, but are often
found near the verb di modify.

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:02.864
Be aware that some words can
function as both a noun and a

00:10:02.864 --> 00:10:05.625
verb, like walk, run, or study.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.180
Pay close attention to the
surrounding words and the sentences,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.310
meaning to determine its function.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:17.860
In that specific case, learn to do
prepositional phrase, spotting quickly

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.990
identify these phrases, preposition
plus a noun or pronoun, as they

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.930
often act as adjectives or adverbs.

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:32.125
Also recognize common conjunction
pairs, like either or neither nor,

00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:37.314
and not only, but also to ensure
both parts are used correctly.

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:40.885
Lastly, always do an adverb function.

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:41.275
Check.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:47.635
If a word modifies a verb, an adjective,
or another adverb, it's an adverb.

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:51.745
If it modifies a noun or
pronoun, it's an adjective.

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:54.820
This distinction is
absolutely crucial for.

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:56.095
Aero spotting.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.699
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:04.439
Now, be aware of these frequent
errors and misunderstandings.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.130
First is confusing adjectives and adverbs.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.589
A very common mistake where an adjective
is used when an adverb is required.

00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:18.660
For example, he sings good is
incorrect because good is an

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.270
adjective, the correct sentences.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.829
He sings well because well
is an adverb modifying sings.

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:31.385
Another big one is subject verb
agreement errors, which is mismatching

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:36.005
the subject and the verb the
friends is studying is incorrect.

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:38.975
It must be the friends are studying.

00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:44.225
Then there are pronoun case errors
using the wrong case for a pronoun.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.930
Between you and I, this
is a secret is wrong.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.540
The correct form is between you and
me because between is a preposition

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.090
and requires an objective pronoun.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
Also watch for incorrect
preposition usage.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:05.540
Saying he is good in mathematics is a
common Indian, but the correct English

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.420
idiom is he is good at mathematics.

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:15.010
Beware of misplaced modifiers, which can
create very funny but ambiguous sentences.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.810
He saw a dog with one eye walking
down the street incorrectly

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.910
implies the street has one eye.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.560
The correct version is.

00:12:23.695 --> 00:12:28.855
He saw a one eye dog walking
down the street and please avoid

00:12:28.855 --> 00:12:32.905
the overuse of conjunctions,
which leads to run-on sentences.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:39.085
She studied hard and she passed the
exam and she celebrated is just clumsy.

00:12:39.445 --> 00:12:40.915
A better constructionist.

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:45.865
She studied hard and she passed
the exam, therefore she celebrated.

00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:51.295
Finally, be careful about using
nouns as verbs incorrectly in

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:52.705
formal English saying he will.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.979
Table, the discussion can be ambiguous.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.000
It is much clearer to say
he'll postpone the discussion.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.000
W Edge Framework summary.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.689
So to summarize everything
in a simple framework.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.045
What are parts of speech?

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:14.145
They are categories of words based on
their grammatical function and job.

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:17.115
In a sentence, why are they so important?

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:21.255
Well, they are essential for
understanding sentence structure,

00:13:21.464 --> 00:13:25.694
ensuring grammatical correctness,
and achieving clear communication.

00:13:26.204 --> 00:13:27.880
When do we apply this knowledge?

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.005
We apply it whenever words are used in
spoken or written form, especially in

00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:36.405
formal contexts and academic writing.

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:38.785
Where is this knowledge crucial?

00:13:39.115 --> 00:13:44.125
It is crucial in English, grammar sentence
construction, language comprehension,

00:13:44.335 --> 00:13:48.895
and effective communication in all
real life and professional settings.

00:13:49.285 --> 00:13:50.695
Who needs to know this?

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:51.835
Absolutely.

00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:55.915
Anyone learning or using the
English language, particularly

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.515
any friend preparing for their
exams and professionals in

00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:01.015
communication heavy roles.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.900
And how do we master them?

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.960
We master them by analyzing their role,
form, and position within a sentence which

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.070
dictates their proper usage and helps
in constructing meaningful expressions.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.600
Fully worked out.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.350
Examples.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.130
Here are three fully worked
out examples to illustrate the

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.050
application of these concepts.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.230
Example, one error spotting question.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.350
Identify the part of the
sentence that contains an error.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.120
The new manager.

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:32.689
A, handled the difficult situation.

00:14:32.689 --> 00:14:40.430
B, very calm, C, and efficiently D. The
options are options A. The new manager

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:43.010
B handled the difficult situation.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.219
C. Very calm, D, and efficiently.

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:49.795
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:50.215 --> 00:14:52.555
All right, let's solve this step by step.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:56.725
Step one, we analyze the
sentence to see what's happening.

00:14:57.025 --> 00:15:00.775
The sentence describes how the
manager handled the situation.

00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:02.605
Handled is our verb.

00:15:02.815 --> 00:15:08.395
Step two, we identify the word in
question, come and its intended role.

00:15:08.815 --> 00:15:11.155
It's meant to describe the verb handled.

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:15.630
When a word describes how an action
is performed, it must be an adverb.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.979
Step three.

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:19.439
We check the part of speech of calm.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.030
Calm is primarily an adjective
like in the C is calm.

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:28.979
Step four, we determine the correct
part of speech needed to modify the

00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:31.500
verb handled and adverb is required.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.589
The adverb you form of calm is calmly.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.770
Step five, we compare
this with other parts.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.420
Part D efficiently is an adverb
correctly modifying handled.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.020
This confirms an adverb is
needed in part C as well.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.160
Step six.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.560
So the error is in part C because
calm, an adjective is used where

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.689
calmly, an adverb is needed.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.900
The correct answer is C. Example
two, fill in the blanks question.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.675
Choose the most appropriate
word to fill in the blank.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.339
The secret remained strictly
between you and dash options,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:17.939
A i, B, me C, myself, D mine.

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:21.780
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.000
Let's break this down.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.870
Step one, identify the
grammatical structure.

00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:32.189
The key phrase is between you and dash.

00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:35.099
The word between is a preposition.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.300
Step two, remember the
rule for pronoun cases.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.609
Prepositions are always followed
by pronouns in the objective case.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.574
Step three, so we need an
objective pronoun for the blank.

00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:58.825
Step four, let's evaluate the options I
is subjective, me is objective, myself

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:01.555
is reflexive, which is not needed here.

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.595
Mine is possessive.

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:09.115
Step five, the only option that
fits the rule is the objective.

00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:10.225
Pronoun me.

00:17:10.585 --> 00:17:16.865
Correct answer is b. Example, three
sentence improvement question.

00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:21.785
Choose the best option to replace
the underlined part of the sentence.

00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:28.115
The committee, along with its members,
are discussing the new policy options.

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:30.095
A are discussing.

00:17:30.455 --> 00:17:32.135
B is discussing.

00:17:32.495 --> 00:17:34.385
C have discussed.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.780
D discusses.

00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:39.975
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:17:40.395 --> 00:17:41.504
Let's solve this.

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:45.885
Step one, identify the true
subject of the sentence.

00:17:46.245 --> 00:17:48.555
The subject is the committee.

00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:54.285
The phrase, along with its members
is just extra information and does

00:17:54.285 --> 00:17:56.655
not affect the number of the subject.

00:17:56.865 --> 00:18:01.785
Step two, determine if the
subject is singular or plural.

00:18:02.219 --> 00:18:06.330
Committee is a singular noun,
acting as a single unit.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.709
Step three, apply the rule
of subject verb agreement.

00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:14.429
A singular subject
requires a singular verb.

00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:15.570
Step four.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:21.120
The original verb R discussing
is plural, so it's incorrect.

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:24.330
Option B is discussing is singular.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.880
Option C have discussed is plural.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.730
Option D discusses is singular, but
changes the tense to simple present,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.860
which alters the meaning is discussing,
maintains the present continuous

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.750
tense of the original sentence.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.010
Step five, the correct option
must agree with the singular

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.409
subject and maintain the tense.

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:53.919
Therefore, is discussing is the correct
choice, correct answer is B. Thank you.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.840
See you in the next lecture.
