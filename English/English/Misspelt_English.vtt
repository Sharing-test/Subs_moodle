00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on misspelled.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.290
This tutorial is part power tool,
part brain gym for understanding

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040
this concept, concept explanation.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.044
All right, let's get straight to it.

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.345
Misspelled words are nothing but words.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.994
Wearing the wrong clothes.

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:30.195
They are spelled incorrectly simple right
now in language proficiency assessments.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.525
These questions are not
there to torture you.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:38.385
I promise they are a sneaky
way to check your vocabulary.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:43.214
And your grip on correct English
spelling, the whole game is

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:45.254
usually one of two things.

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:50.864
Either they give you a bunch of words
and you have to find the one that's

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:55.815
the odd one out, the one with the
spelling mistake, or they give you

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.735
multiple spellings of the same word
and you have to pick the one true

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:03.015
champion, the correctly spelled one.

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:07.185
It's like a spot the difference
game, but four words.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:09.625
Real world relevance.

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:14.335
Now you might ask, sir, why
does this matter so much?

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:15.235
Array?

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.315
Accurate written communication
is the backbone of any

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.295
professional world, correct?

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.425
Spelling isn't just about
being a grammar nerd.

00:01:24.664 --> 00:01:30.065
It ensures your message is crystal clear
and maintains your professionalism.

00:01:30.544 --> 00:01:34.384
Imagine sending an official
document with silly errors.

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:38.104
It directly hurts how
seriously people take you.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:42.455
Think about email communication
where you are sending clear.

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:48.425
Error free emails to your team or
clients or in report writing, preparing

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:50.945
professional reports that are precise.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:55.415
It is vital for document
preparation, creating forms or

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.095
presentations without errors.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:03.155
It's also key in data entry for
ensuring accuracy, even in official

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:07.560
correspondence, drafting letters that
show you pay attention to detail.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:13.055
And of course, in proofreading,
reviewing your own or someone else's

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:15.424
work before it goes out into the wild.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:20.955
Breakdown of question types based
on the patterns in your exam.

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:24.585
These questions like to
appear in different costumes.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.985
Let's break down their avatars.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:32.745
About 45% of the time you'll see the
identify the misspelled word type.

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:37.635
They give you four or five words,
and your job is to pinpoint the

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.615
one culprit that is spelled wrong.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.990
Then making up around 30% of
cases is the opposite Challenge.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.440
Identify the correctly spelled word here.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.730
They give you several versions of
one word, all spelled differently,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.500
and only one is correct.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
A smaller, trickier version
at about 15% is the sentence

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.890
based misspelled word question.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.090
You get a full sentence with a
misspelled word, hiding inside.

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:08.535
And you have to find it or
choose its correct form.

00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:14.475
And finally, the last 10% is the fill in
the blanks with correct spelling type A

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:19.364
sentence has a gap, and the options are
different spellings of the same word.

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:23.654
Your mission is to pick the right
one to complete the sentence.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.670
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.830
While there are no magical mats
formulas, we do have some good old

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.240
mantras for spelling first, the classic
I before E, except after C, or when

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.730
sounding like a as in neighbor or way.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.795
Remember, receive versus believe.

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:49.955
Next is dropping the E. When
you add a suffix, that starts

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:52.115
with a wow to a word ending.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:58.900
In E, you usually say goodbye to the E.
For example, love plus ink becomes loving.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.960
Then there's doubling the consonant
for a one syllable word ending in a

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.660
single consonant after a single wow.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.290
You double up that consonant
when adding a suffix.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.234
That starts with a wow, think run plus.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.300
Ink becomes running.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.210
Don't forget about changing Y to
I when a word ends in a consonant

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.330
followed by y, change that Y to an
I before adding a suffix, unless

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.720
that suffix itself starts with I. So
happy plus ness becomes happiness.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:45.160
For plurals, most nouns just add s. But if
they end in SXZC or ssh, they need an es.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.910
Lastly, get friendly with common
suffixes and prefixes like RI

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.310
and D-I-O-N-S-I-O-N able, I mint.

00:04:57.685 --> 00:04:59.005
Methods of solving.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.585
So how do we tackle these questions?

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.605
First, use a visual scan
and familiarity check.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.285
Just read the words.

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:11.635
Often a wrong spelling will
just look odd to your brain.

00:05:11.785 --> 00:05:15.505
If you've seen the word enough
times, trust that gut feeling.

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:19.345
But always double check
for long, scary words.

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.175
Break them into syllables.

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:25.470
Chopping them into smaller parts
makes it easier to spot an error.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.510
And of course, apply spelling rules.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.670
Those tricks we just talked about.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.540
Use them.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.450
Also, check for common confusions.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.510
Be very aware of homophones words that
sound the same, but mean different things

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.980
like there, there and there, or words
that look similar like effect and effect.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
You can also do a root word
prefix, suffix analysis.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.840
Break the word into its parts.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.130
Check the spelling of each and see
if they fit together correctly.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.730
Finally, the good old
method of elimination.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.610
If you are stuck, eliminate the options.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.080
You are sure are correct.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.150
This improves your chances a lot,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.065
For some smart cuts.

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:15.545
Focus on vowels.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.060
And double letters.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.820
Many mistakes happen with vowels or
deciding if a consonant is single or

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.300
double give these areas extra attention.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.280
You can also pronounce the
word either silently or aloud.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.100
Sometimes hearing it slowly can help
you catch a missing or extra letter.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.780
It is also wise to look
for common misspellings.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.640
Keep a little mental list of words
that everyone gets wrong, like

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.489
definitely separate, accommodate,
and receive for sentence questions.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.469
Use contextual clues.

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:58.155
The sentence can give you a hint
about the intended word, helping

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.280
you figure out the correct spelling.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.520
Finally, do a quick scan for anomalies.

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:06.845
Your brain is a pattern
recognition machine.

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:12.455
A word that breaks a common spelling
pattern will often jump right out at you.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.245
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:17.885
Let's talk about the common traps.

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:21.785
A big one is an over-reliance
on pronunciation.

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:24.875
English spelling is famously not phonetic.

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:28.835
If you spell Wednesday as
Wednesday because of how it

00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:30.425
sounds, you are in trouble.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.110
Another is ignoring silent letters,
like forgetting the Kerr in knowledge.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.530
Be careful about confusing homophones.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.850
Mixing up two, two, and
two is a classic blunder.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.830
People also make mistakes with the
incorrect doubling of consonants, like

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.365
writing occurred instead of occurred.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.590
A frequent error is misplacing eye.

00:07:54.835 --> 00:08:00.655
E slash ei, especially when the
I before E Rule is misapplied and

00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:03.234
finally, carelessness with common words.

00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:08.094
Sometimes we get the simple everyday
words wrong just because we are

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:09.924
too confident or in a hurry.

00:08:10.284 --> 00:08:14.500
Don't let that be you, my
friend, WH Framework Summary.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:20.685
So to put it all in a nutshell,
what is this topic about?

00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:25.515
It's all about identifying words
that are spelled incorrectly.

00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:27.734
And why is it important?

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:33.735
Because it's absolutely essential for
clear, professional, written communication

00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:36.194
and showing your language skills.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.370
When do we use this skill?

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:44.970
We apply it when drafting documents,
emails, reports, and of course, during

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.980
language proficiency assessments.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.690
Where is it relevant?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.910
It's relevant in all professional
settings, academic writing, and

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.770
your competitive examinations.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:57.720
Who needs this?

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.510
Frankly, anyone involved in writing
from professionals and academics to

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.580
every friend preparing for exams.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.960
And how do we master it?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.260
By applying spelling rules, using visual
recognition, breaking down words, and

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.155
understanding the common pitfalls.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.740
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.320
Example, one question.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:28.620
Identify the misspelled word among
the following options A, occasion

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.090
B, separate C, definite D. Receive,
understand the question before

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.730
moving to explanation solution.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.560
Let's look at this step by step.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.140
First, we examine each word.

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:46.270
Occasion looks good.

00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:52.390
Double C single S separate is
a classic trap, but it has para

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.550
in the middle, so it is correct.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.510
Definite.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.829
It is also correct.

00:09:57.099 --> 00:09:58.959
But look at receive.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:09:59.829
Ah.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:06.185
Here we remember our mantra I before
E, except after C. Since there is

00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:11.435
a C right before it must be EI,
the correct spelling is receive.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.925
So option D is our answer.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.280
Example two question.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.120
Choose the correctly spelled word
options A, accommodate B, accommodate

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.420
C, accommodate D accommodate.

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:30.935
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:31.584 --> 00:10:32.395
Solution.

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.635
This word is a superstar of misspelling.

00:10:36.084 --> 00:10:38.995
The rule to remember for
accommodate is simple.

00:10:39.444 --> 00:10:41.155
It's very accommodating.

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:46.194
It has space for a double C and a
double M. Let's check the options.

00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:52.705
Option A accommodate has both
double C and double M. Perfect.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:58.135
The other options B, C, and D are
all missing one or both of the

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:00.745
double letters making them incorrect.

00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:06.150
The correct answer is a.
Example three question.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.260
In which of the following sentences
is there a misspelled word?

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.250
Options?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.030
A. The committee decided
to postpone the meeting.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.660
B. Her perseverance led to her success.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.710
C. He received a compliment
for his excellent work.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.430
D. The principal reason for
his absence was illness.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:31.795
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:37.495
Here, we must read each sentence
carefully, sentence A seems fine.

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:41.995
Committee is another tricky word,
but it's spelled correctly here.

00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:45.985
Sentence B, perseverance
and success are correct.

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:50.035
Sentence C received and
compliment are also correct.

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:54.475
Now let's check sentence
D, the principle reason.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.555
Wait a minute.

00:11:55.855 --> 00:11:58.645
Principle means a rule or a belief.

00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:03.204
The context here wants to say
the main or primary reason.

00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:05.785
The word for that is principle.

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:12.415
So in this context, principle is the wrong
word, used as a misspelling of principle.

00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:15.385
Therefore, sentence D contains the error.

00:12:16.074 --> 00:12:16.765
Thank you.

00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:18.535
See you in the next lecture.
