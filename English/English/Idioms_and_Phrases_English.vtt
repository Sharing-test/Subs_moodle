Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on idioms and phrases.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.730
Have you ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.810
This is it.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.520
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.250
So what exactly are these
idioms and phrases you ask Aaba?

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
They're simply groups of words that
when put together have a meaning that's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.540
completely different from what the
individual words literally suggest.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.930
Imagine calling someone a couch potato.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
You don't mean they're a root
vegetable chilling on your sofa, right?

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.210
You mean.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.360
They're lazy.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.460
These expressions are a big part of
the English language, adding a lot

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.080
of richness, color, and expressive
power to our communication.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.750
If you want to understand English
effectively and use it like a pro, getting

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.570
a grip on these is absolutely crucial.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.220
My friend, it's like learning the
secret handshake of the language.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:07.274
Real world relevance.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:11.265
Now, why should a smart friend
like you bother with these,

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.765
especially if you're aiming for a
role where communication is key?

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:21.345
Well, understanding idioms and phrases
helps you talk effectively with all

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:23.505
kinds of customers and colleagues.

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:27.645
It prevents those awkward
lost in translation moments

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:28.935
in nuanced conversations.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.280
Plus it enables super fast comprehension
of official documents and even informal

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.260
discussions, which is absolutely
essential for your daily operations.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210
You don't want to bark up the wrong tree
when dealing with a loan application.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.780
Do you?

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:54.495
Breakdown of question types based
on past exam patterns for your exam.

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:59.835
Questions on idioms and phrases usually
pop up in a few interesting formats.

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:05.355
First, we have sentence completion or
fill in the blanks, which makes up about

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:11.025
40% of the questions here a sentence will
have a blank, and you need to pick the

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:15.795
perfect idiom of phrase from the given
options to complete it meaningfully.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.239
Think of it as finding the missing puzzle
piece, but for words, then their sentence

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.310
improvement of phrase replacement.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.630
Roughly 30% in this type
A part of a sentence.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.570
Often an idiom itself will be underlined.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.440
Your job is to choose the
best option to replace it.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.820
Making the sentence grammatically
correct and contextually spot on.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.209
It's like giving the
sentence a stylish makeover.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.660
Next arrow detection, about 15% of the
questions a sentence will be chopped into

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.670
parts, and you have to play detective
identifying which part contains an

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.310
incorrect use of an idiom of phrase.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.710
Don't worry, we'll teach you how to
smell a rat when it comes to wrong usage.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.100
Matching or column
matching accounts for 10%.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.740
Here you get two columns, one with idioms
and phrases the other with their meanings,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.410
and you just need to match them up Simple
like matching socks, but way more fun.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.260
Finally, direct meaning questions
about 5% and idiom of phrase is given

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.490
directly and you simply choose its
correct, meaning from the options.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.940
No beating around the bush
here, straight to the point.

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:36.975
Formulas plus tricks.

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.945
Now for the secret sauce, the mantras.

00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:44.295
To crack these questions, first
and foremost, always, always

00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:46.364
look for contextual clues.

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:50.385
The words surrounding the idiom,
the overall meaning of the sentence.

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:54.734
They often drop subtle hints like
a friend whispering answers in

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.805
an exam, but totally legal here.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.010
Next elimination.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.780
If you don't know the exact meaning,
start kicking out options that are clearly

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.270
irrelevant or outright contradictory.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.490
It's like playing pathy with
fewer lifelines, but more logic.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.790
Then consider the
positive or negative tone.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.280
Does the idiom sound good or bad?

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.365
This can significantly help
narrow down your choices.

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:23.695
Here's a tricky one word association.

00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:29.545
While idioms are not literal, sometimes
a key word might have a very loose or

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:31.675
even ironic connection to the meaning.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:35.575
Use this trick with extreme
caution, though, because don't

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.645
put all your eggs in one basket.

00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:39.295
Isn't about eggs at all.

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:44.974
Is it finally, and this is the most
crucial trick practice recognition.

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:49.925
The more idioms you encounter, the more
you understand, the easier it becomes

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:52.205
to recognize new ones in context.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:54.575
It's like building your own dictionary.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:56.315
Brick, bi, linguistic brick.

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:00.495
Methods of solving.

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.734
So how do we actually
solve these questions?

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:08.174
Let's break it down step by
step like making a perfect chi.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.565
First, read the entire sentence carefully.

00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:13.484
Get the overall context.

00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:15.700
Understand what the sentence
is trying to convey.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.859
Don't rush belly so much.

00:05:18.474 --> 00:05:23.965
Second, identify the idiom of phrase,
if it's a blank, analyze what kind of

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:25.974
meaning is missing from the sentence.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:31.825
Third, consider the literal meaning,
but then smartly discarded briefly.

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.985
Think about what the words literally mean.

00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:39.354
Then consciously remind yourself that the
idioms meaning will be entirely different.

00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:40.645
This helps clear your mind.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.910
Fourth infer based on context, use
those surrounding words and the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.230
sentences theme to deduce the lightly
non-literal meaning you are playing.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.770
Detective.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.470
Remember fifth, evaluate options.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.370
Go through each multiple choice
option and see which meaning

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.470
best fits your inferred context.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.160
Don't just pick the first one
that looks okay and finally.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.900
Test the chosen option.

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:08.890
Mentally substitute your chosen
option back into the sentence to

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.929
make sure it makes perfect sense.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.820
If it feels right, it probably is.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.090
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.080
Now for some real jugar
shortcuts and smart techniques,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.510
first root word association.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.830
For some idioms, even if not
literal, a core word might

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.390
hint at the general domain.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.610
For example, blue in once in a
blue moon, hints at rarity as blue

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.740
moons don't happen often, do they?

00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:42.675
Second categorization group,
idioms by theme, money, idioms,

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:47.085
time idioms emotions, animal
idioms, food idioms, et cetera.

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:49.395
This helps in memory and recall.

00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:51.345
Third, visualization.

00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:54.915
Try to create a mental image
of the idioms, literal meaning,

00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:58.065
and then creatively connected
to its figurative, meaning.

00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:00.405
It's like making a mini
movie in your head.

00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:03.565
Fourth, focus on frequently
appearing idioms.

00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:06.594
Many exams, love to reuse common idioms.

00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:07.945
Prioritize learning.

00:07:07.945 --> 00:07:09.985
Those they're your low hanging fruit.

00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.805
And last, but not the least, flashcards.

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:15.385
Yes, old school, but super effective.

00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:20.185
Use digital or physical flashcards
for quick revision and memorization.

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:23.725
Repeat, repeat, repeat until
it's at your fingertips.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.010
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.740
A beware of these pitfalls,
lest you fall flat on your face.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.520
The biggest mistake is
literal interpretation.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.790
Assuming idioms mean exactly what the
individual words suggest is a recipe

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.490
for disaster, please don't do it.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.250
Another common one is confusing.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.840
Similar sounding idioms.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.770
Mixing up idioms that sound alike,
but have totally different meanings.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.150
For example, bite The bullet
is about enduring hardship,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.980
not about a bulletproof.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.810
Then ignoring context.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.890
Applying an idiom without
considering how it fits into the

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.050
broader sentence or paragraph.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.450
It's like wearing a tuxedo to a beach
party looks outta place doesn't it?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.300
Also, over generalizing meanings.

00:08:21.695 --> 00:08:26.075
Assuming an idiom has a very broad
meaning when it's quite specific

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:28.895
and finally incorrect prepositions.

00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:33.905
This is a common blunder using the
wrong preposition within a phrasal

00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:35.855
verb or idiomatic expression.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:39.395
It's a small word, but
it can change everything.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.045
WH framework summary.

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:47.655
Let's quickly sum up this funder with
our classic WH framework just to make

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:49.695
sure everything is crystal clear.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:52.215
So what are idioms and phrases?

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:56.265
They are groups of words with a
non-literal figurative meaning.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.960
Simple.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.340
Why do we use them to add
expressiveness, nuance, and

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.320
cultural richness to our language?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.020
They make our conversations more colorful.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.670
When are they applied in both
formal and informal communication

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.490
to convey complex ideas concisely.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.050
No need for long paragraphs.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.939
Where are they used?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.490
Everywhere in everyday conversations,
literature, media, and of course

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.050
professional communication.

00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:28.910
You'll find them reigning cats
and dogs everywhere who uses them?

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.319
Native speakers, language learners
like you and anyone aiming

00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:35.030
for effective communication.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.290
So basically.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.100
Everyone.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.240
And how are they understood
through context, memorization

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.860
and repeated exposure.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.110
Never by literal interpretation.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.110
You've got to feel the
vibe, not just the words.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.830
Fully worked out examples,
Chalo, let's see.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.220
Some real examples where
theory meets practice.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.180
It's like watching a live match
after all the net practice.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.550
Example, one question.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.080
After working for S on the project,
he decided to dash and go home.

00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:08.995
Options.

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:10.615
A, pull his weight.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.325
B, call it a day.

00:10:12.475 --> 00:10:14.035
C. Spill the beans.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.445
D, break a leg.

00:10:15.805 --> 00:10:19.825
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:24.955
Step one, understand the context the
sentence tells us someone worked for a

00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:27.565
long time and then decided to head home.

00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:31.495
This clearly implies an action
related to finishing work.

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:31.975
Right.

00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:34.564
Two, analyze the options.

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:37.595
A pull his weight means to do once.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.765
Fair share of work.

00:10:38.885 --> 00:10:40.985
Does that fit going home after working?

00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:41.555
No.

00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:45.814
Boss B, call it a day, means
to stop working on something.

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:46.715
Bingo.

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:50.375
This perfectly matches the context
of finishing work and leaving.

00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:51.569
C spill.

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:53.729
The beans means to reveal a secret.

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:55.650
Are we talking about secrets here?

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:56.699
Not at all.

00:10:56.969 --> 00:11:01.199
D, break a leg means good luck
usually set to performers.

00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:04.109
Definitely not about going home from work.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.790
The correct answer is option B.
Step three, choose the best fit.

00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:12.780
Option B, call it a day, is
the most appropriate idiom.

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:16.800
It perfectly conveys the meaning
of stopping work and heading home.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.560
Example two question.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.930
The new policy though well-intentioned
is likely to dash options

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.970
A. Hit the nail on the head.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.100
B, throw caution to the wind.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.200
C, open a can of worms.

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:33.090
D. Bark up the wrong tree.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.290
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:39.895
Step one, understand the context.

00:11:40.135 --> 00:11:43.825
The sentence talks about a policy
that's well intentioned, but

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:48.205
likely to have a negative outcome,
implying it'll create problems.

00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:52.825
It's like when you try to fix one thing
and accidentally break three others.

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:55.310
Step two, analyze the options.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.930
A hit the nail on the head means
to describe a situation exactly.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.370
This suggests a positive, accurate
outcome, which clashes with the though

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.770
well-intentioned part, not this one.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.730
B, throw caution to the wind
means to take a risk without

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.380
worrying about the consequences.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.490
This doesn't quite fit the idea
of the policy causing problems.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.120
See.

00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:21.955
Open a can of worms means to create
a complicated situation where solving

00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.845
one problem leads to many more.

00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:28.555
Ah, this aligns perfectly with the
idea of a well-intentioned policy

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:30.925
leading to unforeseen difficulties.

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:32.155
It's a mess.

00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:35.935
D, back up The wrong tree
means to pursue a mistake.

00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:36.985
Course of action.

00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:41.335
While it implies a mistake, open
a can of worms better describes

00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:45.265
the result of the policy leading
to multiple complex problems.

00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:50.075
Step three, choose the best fit
Option C Open a can of worms

00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:51.935
is the most suitable idiom.

00:12:52.115 --> 00:12:56.015
It perfectly indicates that the
policy will inadvertently lead to

00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:58.565
many complex and unforeseen problems.

00:12:58.805 --> 00:13:03.095
The correct answer is option
C. Example three question.

00:13:03.725 --> 00:13:08.345
Despite facing numerous challenges, she
decided to dash and achieve her goals.

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:09.574
Options.

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.194
A bite the bullet.

00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:12.814
B, miss the boat.

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:16.385
C. Make ends meet D. Beat around the bush.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.564
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:19.714 --> 00:13:20.495
Solution.

00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:23.074
Step one, understand the context.

00:13:23.314 --> 00:13:26.045
The sentence shows someone facing
difficulties, but choosing to.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.610
Persevere and achieve their goals.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.320
This requires an idiom.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.980
That means enduring hardship
or unpleasantness with courage.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.450
She's not giving up.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:35.930
You see?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.450
Step two, analyze the options.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.310
A bite the bullet means to endure a
difficult or unpleasant situation.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.970
This fits the context of
overcoming challenges perfectly.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.020
Full marks here.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:49.395
Be miss.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.450
The boat means to lose an opportunity
not relevant to overcoming

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.160
challenges and pursuing goals.

00:13:55.295 --> 00:13:57.395
This isn't about missed chances.

00:13:57.635 --> 00:14:01.625
C, make ends meet means to earn
just enough money to live on.

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:05.675
This is about financial survival,
not general challenges and

00:14:05.675 --> 00:14:07.235
perseverance towards goals.

00:14:07.474 --> 00:14:11.344
D, beat around the bush means to
avoid getting to the main point.

00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:15.305
This is about communication
style, not enduring hardship.

00:14:15.515 --> 00:14:19.625
Step three, choose the best
fit option a bite the bullet.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.220
Accurately describes the act of
bravely enduring difficulties

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.270
to achieve something.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:24.810
This

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.420
answer.

Thank you.
