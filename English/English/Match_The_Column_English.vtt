Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Match the Column.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.320
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.210
Concept explanation.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.120
Think of this question type as a
dating app, but for sentences, you

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.740
are presented with two columns,
usually column one and column two.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.890
Each column has these lonely, incomplete
sentence fragments, phrases, or clauses.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.310
Your job is to be the perfect matchmaker.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960
You must pair apart from column
one with, apart from column two, to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
create a grammatically correct and
contextually meaningful complete sentence.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.620
No awkward pairs allowed.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.045
Real world relevance.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:55.545
Now, you might ask, sir,
why are we doing this aray?

00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.915
Because in your professional life, clear
and precise communication is paramount.

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:05.265
These match the column exercises
are like gym training for your

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:09.765
brain, enhancing your ability
to construct coherent sentences.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:15.235
This is crucial for crafting clear
official emails, creating well-structured

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:20.574
business reports with logical flow and
ensuring all your customer communications

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:22.615
are accurate and professional.

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:27.175
These skills help you avoid
embarrassing misunderstandings and

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.634
project a sharp professional image.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.960
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
So what flavors do these questions
come in based on past patterns for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.640
your exam, you'll find a few types.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.375
The most common one, about 70% of
the time is sentence completion.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:51.335
This is the classic style where
you combine parts to form a proper

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:56.285
sentence, testing everything from
subject verb agreement to logical, slow.

00:01:56.765 --> 00:02:02.135
Next, about 15% of questions are
vocabulary based, where one column

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.995
might have words and the other, their
synonyms, antonyms, or definitions.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:11.555
Then there's phrase matching,
making up about 10% of cases,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.695
which involves matching idiomatic
expressions or phrasal wordss.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:21.515
And finally, a rare 5% might be error
detection, where one column has a

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.035
mistake and the other has its correction.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.150
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.170
Ready for the secret formulas,
the tricks of the trade.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
First, always check for
grammatical agreement.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.380
This is your number one rule.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.200
Subject must agree with the verb.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.550
Nouns with pronouns and
tenses must be consistent.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.790
Second, ensure contextual coherence.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:53.115
The final sentence must make
logical sense, not sound like

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:55.155
something from a fantasy novel.

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:58.695
Third, master the elimination strategy.

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:04.035
If a pairing is obviously wrong,
grammatically or contextually, just

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:07.035
throw it out for vocabulary questions.

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:11.829
Understanding common prefixes and
suffixes can give you major clues.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.730
Also keep an eye out for parallelism in
sentence structures and identify key words

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.030
in each part that hint at connection.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:24.525
Methods of solving.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:28.845
So here is your battle plan
for solving these questions.

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:34.665
First, read all the parts in column one
to understand their meaning and structure.

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:40.455
Then for each part in column one,
quickly scan column two for potential

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:46.160
matches that seem to fit logically and
grammatically form some tentative pairs

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.675
in your head or on your rough paper.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.900
Next, you must verify these pairs.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.360
Read the combined sentence aloud.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.590
Does it flow?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.240
Is the grammar correct?

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.250
Does it make complete sense?

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.300
Use the given multiple choice
options to your advantage.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.140
If an option confirms a pair
you are sure about, great.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.300
If it suggests a pair you've ruled out,
you can eliminate that whole option.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.200
This process of elimination is your
best weapon when you are stuck.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.680
And a pro tip, always
start with the pairs.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.420
You are most confident about
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.240
Want some shortcuts and smart jugar.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.099
Of course you do try endpoint analysis.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.750
Pay close attention to the end of
the phrases in column one and the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.880
beginning of phrases in column two.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.860
It's simple chemistry.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.390
Use grammar tags to quickly
identify the role of the words.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.680
A quick, singular, or plural
check is also a lifesaver.

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:54.015
Ensure singular subjects are
matched with singular verbs.

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:55.994
Check for tense harmony.

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:59.685
Don't mix up past and
present like a confused time.

00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:00.284
Traveler.

00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:02.804
Also look for conjunction clues.

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:08.234
A word like although or because tells
you what kind of clause should follow.

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.575
Finally, the golden rule.

00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:16.484
Always read the combined sentence if
it sounds awkward or just wrong it.

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:20.985
Probably is common mistakes
and misconceptions.

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:25.635
Now, let's talk about the common
traps my friends fall into.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:29.505
The biggest mistake is
ignoring grammatical rules.

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:34.155
Many friends focus only on
meaning and forget basic grammar.

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:36.105
Don't make that mistake.

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.675
Avoid hasty matching
based on a single word.

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:42.075
You must read the full fragments.

00:05:42.555 --> 00:05:48.135
Another classic blunder is overlooking on
text, which leads to grammatically correct

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:50.985
but logically nonsensical sentences.

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:55.755
Please do not settle for the first
plausible match without checking

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.885
if other combinations are better.

00:05:58.245 --> 00:06:02.625
Vocabulary gaps can be tricky
and misinterpreting connectors

00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:05.865
like conjunctions can lead
you down the long path.

00:06:06.075 --> 00:06:07.065
Be careful.

00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:09.405
W Edge Framework summary.

00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:14.025
So to summarize this whole
thing quickly, what is it?

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:17.085
It's matching sentence
fragments from two columns.

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:21.405
Why is it important to assess
your grasp of English grammar

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.875
vocabulary and logical reasoning.

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:25.615
When do you see this?

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:30.235
It's a common feature in the English
language section of competitive exams.

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:31.705
Where will you find it?

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.035
Primarily in the objective
type English test.

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:36.535
Who is this for?

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:40.735
For aspiring friends, like you
aiming for those government and other

00:06:40.945 --> 00:06:43.465
top jobs, and how do we solve it?

00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:49.105
By analyzing grammar context and
using smart elimination strategies

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:51.475
fully worked out Examples.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.540
Example, one question match the
column in the following question.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.000
Two columns are provided with three
phrases Each column, one contains

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.030
sentence beginnings, A, B, C, and
column two contains sentence endings.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.690
DEF match each phrase from column one
with the most appropriate phrase from

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.180
column two to form grammatically correct
and contextually meaningful sentences.

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:26.565
Column one A, the recent
policy changes are expected.

00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:33.195
B, despite the economic slowdown,
the company C. To improve customer

00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:40.695
satisfaction, businesses must focus column
2D on enhancing their service quality.

00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:47.625
E. To boost the country's economic growth,
f managed to increase its market share.

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:48.645
Options.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.845
A A EB, FCD, B.

00:07:53.115 --> 00:08:04.185
A D, BE, CF, CAF, BD, CE, DAE,
BDCF understand the question

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.745
before moving to explanation.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.460
Solution.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.010
Let's break this down first.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.150
A says, the recent policy
changes are expected.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.370
This needs a purpose, which usually
starts with two plus a verb.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.050
Looking at column two E to
boost the country's economic

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.850
growth is a perfect fit.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.740
So we have ae.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:34.515
Next B starts with, despite
the economic slowdown, the word

00:08:34.544 --> 00:08:36.944
despite signals a contrast.

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:39.255
We need a positive outcome.

00:08:39.674 --> 00:08:44.865
F managed to increase its market
share provides that positive contrast.

00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:50.865
So B, F, finally C says,
what businesses must focus.

00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:55.125
The verb focus almost always
pairs with the preposition.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:09:00.295
On D, on enhancing their service
quality is the perfect match.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:07.675
So cd, our final combination
is A-E-B-F-C-D, correct option.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:14.550
A, A E, B, FC, D. Example two question.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.089
Match the phrases from column one with
phrases from column two to form meaningful

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.520
and grammatically correct sentences.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.480
Column one A, the new software update.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.380
B, investors are cautious
about the market.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:40.150
C. The ancient ruins provide a
glimpse column 2D into the lives of

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.850
early civilizations, e volatility
due to recent global events.

00:09:46.234 --> 00:09:51.334
F to enhance user experience
and security options.

00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:54.364
A. A-D-B-E-C-F.

00:09:54.755 --> 00:09:56.135
BAF.

00:09:56.224 --> 00:10:06.064
BECD, C-A-E-B-F-C-D-D-A-F-B-D-C-E
understand the question

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:07.594
before moving to explanation.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.230
Solution.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.830
All right, let's solve this one phrase.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.040
A is the new software update aims.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.730
The verb aims is usually followed
by two and an infinitive F to

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.650
enhance user experience and security
fits this structure perfectly.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:35.795
So AF is our first pair now for B.
Investors are cautious about the market.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:41.825
They are cautious about what e
volatility due to recent global events

00:10:42.035 --> 00:10:44.195
explains the reason for their caution.

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.805
It's a perfect noun phrase to follow.

00:10:46.925 --> 00:10:48.215
So BE.

00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:52.895
Lastly, C says, the ancient
ruins provide a glimpse.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:59.340
A glimpse is often into something D
into the lives of early civilizations.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.350
Logically completes this tart.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.900
So, c. D, the correct set is A-F-B-E-C-D.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.020
Looking at the options we find our match.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.400
Final answer.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.550
BAF, BECD.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.460
Example three question.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:23.010
Choose the combination from the given
options that forms grammatically correct

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.640
and coherent sentences by joining parts
from column one and column two, column

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:36.720
one A. The government's initiative to
promote digital literacy B, while the

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.840
initial response was positive C. Many
developing countries face challenges.

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:44.709
Column 2D.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.870
In providing access to quality
education E, its long-term

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.790
impact remains to be seen.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.319
F is crucial for economic
development options.

00:11:56.704 --> 00:12:11.310
A, A EB, D. C. FBAF, BECD, C-A-D-B-F,
C-E-D-A-E-B-F-C-D understand the question

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.010
before moving to explanation solution.

00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.305
Let's analyze this final example.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:22.135
A is a long subject phrase,
the government's initiative

00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:24.055
to promote digital literacy.

00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:26.574
It needs a predicate, a verb.

00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:30.505
Part F is crucial for
economic development.

00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:34.405
Provides that verb and completes
the sentence beautifully.

00:12:34.585 --> 00:12:35.005
So.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:42.450
AF next B starts with, while the initial
response was positive, the word while

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.630
sets up a contrast E. Its long-term
impact remains to be seen, provides

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.940
the perfect contrasting main clause.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.910
So B. E, finally C says, many
developing countries face challenges.

00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:04.015
The word challenges is often followed
by in plus ager D. In providing

00:13:04.015 --> 00:13:08.935
access to quality education describes
the area of challenge perfectly.

00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:14.905
So CT A winning
combination is A-F-B-E-C-D.

00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:19.405
Final answer, B-A-F-E-C-D.

00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:20.155
Thank you.
