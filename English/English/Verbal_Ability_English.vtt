Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on verbal ability.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.250
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:15.495
Concept explanation.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.515
So what on earth is this verbal ability?

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:26.025
It's simply a person's power to understand
and effectively use the English language

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:31.575
in the world of competitive exams, it's
how they check your command over various

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:36.800
parts of the language, like grammar,
vocabulary, reading, comprehension, and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.315
even your logical reasoning with words.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:44.355
It's not just about knowing fancy
words, it's about how well you can

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:49.155
interpret, analyze, and communicate
information written in English.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:54.315
Basically, they want to see if your
command over the language is good

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.325
enough for professional communication.

00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:57.045
Simple, no.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
Real world relevance and
why is this so important?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.330
You ask.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.890
Think of it this way.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.320
Strong communication is absolutely
essential for interacting clearly

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.310
with customers and your colleagues,
helping to prevent those silly

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.830
misunderstandings in banking operations.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.020
Then there's report writing.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.620
It's crucial for drafting
accurate and professional

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.660
reports and official documents.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.430
Good verbal ability also helps in
customer service, allowing you to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.500
understand what a customer is asking
for, and responding clearly, which

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.200
builds trust and solves problems faster.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.170
It's also vital for policy interpretation,
for making sense of complex banking

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.220
policies and regulations to ensure
you are following the rules.

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:53.325
And let's not forget negotiation
where it helps you articulate

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:55.155
your ideas persuasively.

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:59.925
Finally, it sharpens your problem
solving skills by enabling you

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:03.660
to analyze information verbally
to find the best solutions.

00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:10.335
Breakdown of question types based
on what we've seen in past exams.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:13.035
The question formats
are quite predictable.

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:19.875
First up is the big boss reading
comprehension or rc, which can be anywhere

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.345
from 25 to 35% of the section here.

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:29.445
You get questions on the passage's
main idea tone and vocabulary.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.940
Next you have spotting errors or sentence
improvement, making up about 15 to 20%.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.340
Then comes the close test, a classic
fill in the blanks for a whole passage

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.430
at around 10 to 15% para jumbles
or sentence rearrangement where you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.440
put sentences in the right order.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.805
Also take up 10 to 15%.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:57.125
You'll also find fill in the
blanks or sentence completion

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.035
questions for another 10 to 15%.

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:06.035
Finally, smaller sections like sentence
connectors and word usage or swapping.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:09.545
Make up the rest each about five to 10%.

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:12.375
Formulas Plus tricks.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:17.265
All right, so here are the secret
formulas and tricks to ace this

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:19.665
section for vocabulary building.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:25.695
Don't just memorize words, learn common
root words, prefixes and suffixes.

00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:29.440
Use flashcards and try to
guess meanings from context.

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.690
For grammar mastery, focus on
the core concepts, subject, VE

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.640
agreement, tenses, parts of speech
articles, and all that good stuff.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.510
Practice is key here for
reading comprehension.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.040
Try active reading.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.480
Skim the passage first for the
main idea, then read the questions

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.709
and finally go back to the
passage to find specific answers.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.890
And please use the elimination strategy.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:01.595
If you can rule out even one wrong
option, your chances of getting it

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:07.775
right go way up for vocabulary questions
like the close test, always look at the

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:10.204
surrounding words for contextual clues.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:15.935
But the ultimate trick, my friend, is
consistent practice, regular practice

00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:21.219
with all question types and timed mock
tests is the only way to truly improve.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.000
Methods of solving.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.280
Now, let's get into the step-by-step
methods for solving these problems,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.320
for reading comprehension.

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.240
First, skim the passage.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.020
Just a quick read to get
the general idea and tone.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.480
Don't get lost in the details yet.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.820
Second, read the questions.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.820
This tells you exactly what to look for.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.099
Third scan for keywords from
the question to locate the

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.719
relevant parts of the passage.

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:55.219
Fourth, for inference questions,
think about the implied meaning,

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:57.950
and finally match and verify.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.239
Choose the option that is most
directly supported by the text

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.370
and avoid using your outside know.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.250
For a close test, first, read the
entire passage Once without looking

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.380
at the options to get the overall
theme, then focus on each blank one

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.659
by one reading the full sentence.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.400
Check the grammatical fit.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.610
Do you need a noun, a verb, an adjective?

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.800
Then check the contextual fit.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.289
Does the word make sense in the story?

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.210
You can mentally insert each option
to see which one feels right, both

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.219
grammatically and contextually.

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.400
For Para Jumbles, your first job is
to identify the opening sentence.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.380
Look for a sentence that introduces
a new topic and can stand on its own.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.840
Next look for connecting words like
pronouns, conjunctions, and transition.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.210
Words that create links between sentences.

00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:55.555
Try to form logical pairs of sentences.

00:05:55.974 --> 00:06:01.135
Then identify the concluding sentence,
which usually summarizes the whole thing.

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:05.365
Finally, arrange your sentences
and read the whole paragraph

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:07.344
to make sure it flows smoothly.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:12.115
For spotting errors or sentence
improvement, first, read the sentence

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.065
carefully to understand its meaning.

00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:16.025
Then check the basics.

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:18.275
Does the subject agree with the verb?

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:20.075
Are the tenses consistent?

00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.685
Are all parts of speech used correctly?

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:28.055
Look for parallelism in lists or
comparisons, and always keep an eye

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:32.224
out for common errors like misplaced
modifiers or redundant words.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.289
Shortcuts and smart techniques
ready for some pro-level moves.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.270
For rc, a smart technique is to read
the questions first before the passage.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.900
This makes your reading
targeted for the close test.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.320
Grasp the theme first by reading
the whole passage quickly.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.570
This helps you pick the right words.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.719
In para jumbles, look for mandatory pairs.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.020
Two sentences that
absolutely must go together.

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:02.825
This drastically reduces your
arrangement options for error spotting.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.094
Try a backwards scan after
reading the sentence.

00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:09.305
Normally read it backwards,
section by section.

00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:13.414
It sounds funny, but it breaks
the flow and makes errors pop out.

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:18.549
For vocabulary, use root word power,
break down unfamiliar words into

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:22.865
their parts, root prefix suffix
to get a clue about the meaning.

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:27.115
And for time management have a
strict time limit for each section.

00:07:27.445 --> 00:07:30.475
If a question is too
hard, mark it and move on.

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.645
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:36.645
Now, let's talk about the common traps.

00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:39.645
Please avoid overreading in rc.

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:41.715
It's a huge time waster.

00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:47.265
Another mistake is ignoring context
in close tests and just picking a

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:49.245
word because it fits grammatically.

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:51.315
Don't do blind guessing.

00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.865
Always use elimination first.

00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:59.775
A big one is just memorizing grammar
rules without knowing how to apply them.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.130
Many friends panic when they
see an unfamiliar word, which

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.450
hurts their performance.

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:06.560
Don't do that.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.330
A major problem is the lack of
timed practice, which leads to poor

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:13.520
time management in the actual exam.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.710
And finally, don't rely on what just
sounds right for grammar questions.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.575
You need to know the actual rule.

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.355
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:08:23.835 --> 00:08:26.955
So to quickly summarize this
whole thing with a W Edge

00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:29.865
framework, what is verbal ability?

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:33.015
It's the test of your
English language proficiency.

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:34.695
Why is it important?

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:39.195
It is crucial for effective
communication and clear expression

00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:40.659
in any professional job.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.549
When is it applied?

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.800
It's used in all sections of the
English test from RC to error spotting.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.450
Where is it relevant?

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.170
It's needed in daily
banking, operations, customer

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.510
interactions, and writing reports.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.560
Who needs it?

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.610
Well, every aspiring officer
and professional who needs

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.290
strong communication skills.

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:04.095
And how do you master it?

00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:09.255
By mastering grammar, building,
vocabulary, and practicing with a logical

00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:12.165
approach, fully worked out examples.

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:15.135
Let's look at an example
for spotting error.

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:20.535
Question one, identify the part of
the sentence that contains an error.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.110
The manager A, along with
his team, BR, working hard.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:34.180
C for the project D, no error E,
options A, the manager B, along

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.030
with his team CR, working hard.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.150
D for the project E. No error.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.020
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.300
Okay, let's break it down.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.750
Step one is to identify the real subject.

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:53.175
Here, the main subject is the manager.

00:09:53.565 --> 00:09:57.315
The phrase, along with his
team, is extra information.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.235
It doesn't control the verb.

00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:02.445
Step two, check, subject, verb agreement.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:07.035
The manager is singular, so
the verb must also be singular.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:10.965
Step three, locate the
verb, which is are working.

00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:13.695
Step four is to spot the mismatch.

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:18.375
R is a plural verb, but our
subject manager is singular.

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:19.335
That's the error.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.215
So step five is to correct it.

00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.725
R. Working hard should
be, is working hard?

00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:26.475
Correct?

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:27.585
Answer C.

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:30.615
Next, an example of a close test.

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:31.665
Question two.

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:35.205
Choose the most appropriate
word to fill in the blank.

00:10:35.685 --> 00:10:36.915
The company decided.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.770
Two dash its operations due to
severe financial difficulties.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:48.610
Options A, expand B Cs
C Commence D, sustain.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.210
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.590
Let's solve this.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.230
Step one, understand the context.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.800
The key phrase is severe
financial difficulties.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.935
This points to something negative.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.300
Step two, let's analyze the options.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.990
Expand means to grow, which
is the opposite of what a

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.610
company in trouble would do.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.610
CS means to stop, which makes sense.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.660
With financial problems,
commence means to start again.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.310
Illogical, sustain means to keep
going, which is what they'd want

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.570
to do, but severe difficulties
make it likely They have to take

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.940
a more drastic step like stopping.

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:35.390
So step three, the best fit given the
financial mess, the most logical action

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:41.510
is to stop operations, correct answer
B. Finally, a para jumble example.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.800
Question three, arrange the
following sentences in a coherent

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:50.959
paragraph A. This led to a
significant increase in productivity.

00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:56.150
B. The company implemented a new
training program for its employees.

00:11:56.375 --> 00:12:00.425
C. As a result, employee
morale also improved.

00:12:00.695 --> 00:12:05.735
D, the program focused on enhancing
their technical skills options.

00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:14.495
A, B. D. A. C. B. B. A. D. C. C, DA,
B. CDC, BAD understand the question

00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:16.385
before moving to explanation.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.420
Let's reassemble this puzzle.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.300
Step one, find the opening sentence.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.920
Sentence B introduces the main
topic, a new training program,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.720
so it's a perfect start.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.630
Step two, find the next logical link.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.940
After introducing the program in B, it
makes sense to explain what it was about.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.700
Sentence D does exactly that, saying
the program focused on technical skills.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.680
So we have a BD pair.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.900
Step three, look for the result.

00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:50.855
After implementing a program
focused on skills D, what happened?

00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:56.045
Sentence A tells us this led to a
significant increase in productivity.

00:12:56.345 --> 00:12:58.805
This connects directly back to bd.

00:12:58.955 --> 00:13:01.685
Now we have B, D, a. Step four.

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:06.965
Look for any further consequence after
productivity increased a sentence.

00:13:06.965 --> 00:13:10.830
C. Add that as a result,
employee morale also improved.

00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:14.605
The word also shows it's
an additional outcome.

00:13:14.725 --> 00:13:19.045
So the final logical sequence is BDAC.

00:13:19.345 --> 00:13:21.745
Correct answer A. Thank you.

00:13:21.805 --> 00:13:22.195
See.
