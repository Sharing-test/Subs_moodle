Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on active and passive voice.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.900
We are about to make the
complicated, ridiculously clear on

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.090
this concept with this tutorial.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.100
All right, my friends.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.340
Let's talk about active and passive voice.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
These are two fundamental
ways to structure sentences in

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
English, distinguishing whether
the subject performs the action.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.260
Active or receives it.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.930
Passive understanding and correctly
using both voices is crucial for

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
clarity, emphasis, and stylistic
variation in your writing and speaking,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.450
especially in competitive exams,
like your exam concept, explanation

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.220
in the active voice, the subject of
the sentence performs the action.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.150
The structure is typically
subject plus verb, plus object.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.090
For example, the friend wrote the
essay Here, friend is the subject

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.610
performing wrote on the object.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.239
Essay.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.905
Simple direct, no confusion in the passive
voice, the subject receives the action.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:17.434
The structure is typically object
plus form of to be plus past

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:20.884
participant of verb plus by plus agent.

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:25.595
For example, the essay was
written by the friend here.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.304
Essay is the subject.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:32.884
Receiving was written and friend
is the agent introduced by buy.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:37.054
The choice between active and
passive voice often depends

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:38.945
on what you want to emphasize.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:43.935
Active voice is generally more
direct, clear and concise.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:48.405
It's usually preferred for most
academic and professional writing.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.785
Passive voice is used when the
doer of the action is unknown,

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:57.690
unimportant, or when the action itself
is more important than the doer.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.479
It's like, who cares who did it?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.490
Just that it was done.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.560
Real world relevance.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.589
Now, why is this important for you?

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.210
For officers, clear and precise
communication is paramount.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.950
Understanding, active and passive
voice helps you draft unambiguous

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.799
reports, emails, and legal documents.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.709
This ensures crystal clarity in financial
transactions and client interactions.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.799
Think of it as avoiding any lost
in translation moments with money,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.290
breakdown of question types.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.780
Questions on active and passive voice in
your competitive exams, primarily test

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.329
your ability to transform sentences.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.590
Identify the correct voice
or correct related errors.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.105
Here's the typical breakdown you'll see.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.019
Voice transformation, 60 to 70%.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.209
This is the most common type.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.649
A sentence is given in one voice
and you convert it to the other.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.690
This involves changing subject
object, verb form, and sometimes

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.570
adding or removing by plus agent.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.454
It's a sentence makeover Really.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.730
Error detection or correction, 15 to
20% sentences come with errors related

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.220
to incorrect or awkward voice usage.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.440
You need to identify the error or
choose the correctly rephrased option.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.870
Be a grammar detective, my friend.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.580
Fill in the blanks, 10 to
15% sentences with a blank.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.130
You must choose the correct verb
form, active or passive that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.990
fits the context and grammar.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.350
Sentence improvement or replacement five
to 10% a part of a sentence is underlined.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.720
You choose the best alternative from
options often involving a voice change

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.090
for better clarity or conciseness.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.310
Make your sentences shine.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.470
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.800
No complex math here, my friend, but
definite rules and clever tricks for

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.140
active and passive voice for active
to passive transformation rules.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.830
One.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.740
Identify SVO, subject verb
object in the active sentence.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.900
Two, swap positions.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.420
Object becomes the passive subject.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.570
Active subject becomes the passive object.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.010
Often with buy.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.460
Three change verb form.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.010
Use the correct auxiliary
verb to be is MR was.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.490
Were be being plus past
participant V three, always four.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.590
Remove agent optional.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.355
If the doer agent is unknown.

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.955
Unimportant or obvious, you can omit it.

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:50.755
Less clutter, sometimes 10
specific auxiliary verbs.

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:52.645
This is your cheat sheet.

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:53.545
Simple.

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:54.085
Present.

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:55.555
Is or Am.

00:04:55.555 --> 00:04:56.125
Or are.

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.385
Plus we three.

00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:58.690
Example is written.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.380
Simple past was, or plus we
three Example was written Simple

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.870
Future will be plus we three.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.290
Example will be written,
present, continuous.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.640
Is or Am.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.350
Or are plus being.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.610
Plus we three.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.135
Example is being written
past, continuous was or were.

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:22.495
Plus being, plus V three.

00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:25.974
Example was being
written, present Perfect.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:29.484
Has or have plus been plus V three.

00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:35.365
Example has been written past
Perfect, had plus been plus V three.

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:41.485
Example had been written Future Perfect
will have plus Bean plus V three.

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.465
Example will have been written.

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:47.495
Modals Modal plus B plus we three.

00:05:47.585 --> 00:05:49.294
Example can be written.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.474
Remember these, they
are your best friends.

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:56.075
Tricks for quick
identification or conversion.

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:57.544
Look for buy.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:01.085
Passive voice often has the
agent introduced by buy.

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:06.835
It's a clue, but not always
present form of to be plus V three.

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:12.565
This is the absolute signature of
passive voice, if you see is amr,

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:15.414
et cetera, followed by a V three.

00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:19.674
It's passive guaranteed
subject, action, relationship.

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:24.775
Ask yourself, is the subject doing
the action active or receiving it?

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.164
Simple logic.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.174
Transitive verbs only.

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:30.604
Only verbs that take an object.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:36.305
Transitive verbs can become passive
in transitive verbs like sleep, arrive

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:39.005
cannot, don't even try my friend.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:41.195
It's a grammar no-go zone.

00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:42.515
Methods of solving.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.770
Here are your step-by-step methods to
ace active and passive voice questions.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.880
One, identify the voice first.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.420
Determine if the sentence
is active or passive.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.315
Check the subject, action, relationship,
and words structure form of two B.

00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:06.015
Plus past participant for passive.

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:07.065
Two.

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:10.695
Identify SVO for active to passive.

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:17.445
If converting active to passive, clearly
identify subject, verb, and object.

00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:18.525
Three.

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:19.395
Identify.

00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:22.025
OVS for passive to active.

00:07:22.534 --> 00:07:28.205
If converting passive to active, pinpoint
the object, which is the passive subject,

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:34.114
the verb, and the agent if present,
as it becomes the new active subject.

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:35.075
Four.

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.354
Apply transformation rules.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:42.825
Based on identified voice and target
voice, apply rules for subject

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:47.475
object positions and verb form
paying close attention to tens.

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:48.405
Five.

00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:50.445
Check for auxiliary verbs.

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:55.035
Ensure the correct to be form
is used according to original

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:57.765
tens and new subject six.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.625
Use past participant.

00:08:00.075 --> 00:08:04.095
Always use the V three form of
the main verb in passive voice.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.415
No excuses.

00:08:05.664 --> 00:08:07.735
Seven, handle the agent.

00:08:08.215 --> 00:08:11.065
Include bi plus agent if important.

00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:16.765
In passive, if converting passive to
active, make the agent the new subject.

00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:17.485
Eight.

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:22.255
Review for grammatical correctness
and meaning after conversion.

00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:23.784
Read the new sentence.

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:25.465
Does it sound correct?

00:08:25.765 --> 00:08:29.425
Does it keep the original meaning
and does it flow naturally?

00:08:29.784 --> 00:08:31.729
A quick check can save your day.

00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:37.305
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be super efficient.

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:37.845
My friend.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.585
Here are some quick tricks.

00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:41.145
Quick voice check.

00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:46.785
See a form of two b isr, et
cetera, immediately followed

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:48.855
by a past participant V three.

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:50.535
It's almost certainly passive.

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:58.030
If not, probably active Subject action
test is the subject, doing the action

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.790
or receiving it, active or passive.

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:04.239
That's your answer,
transitive verb requirement.

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:06.910
Remember, only transitive verbs.

00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:11.650
Verbs with a direct object can be
converted to passive int transitive

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.995
verbs are off limits for passive voice.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.260
Eliminate options in multi-choice.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:22.390
Quickly remove options that have wrong
verb forms or change the original meaning.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.650
Smart thinking.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.630
Focus on the main verb, identify
the main verb and its stents.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.990
This guides your choice of auxiliary to
be and the past participant by home test.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:41.230
Can you logically add by whom or by what
after the verb, and get a sensible answer.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.090
If yes, it's likely passive
or can be made passive.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.870
Try it.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.220
It's a fun trick.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.250
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.370
All right, let's learn from other slipups.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.060
My friends.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.920
Beware of these common mistakes.

00:09:57.345 --> 00:09:59.895
Confusing, passive with past tense.

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:02.835
Passive voice doesn't mean past tense.

00:10:03.195 --> 00:10:05.835
The two B word can be in any tense.

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.955
Example is being built is present.

00:10:08.955 --> 00:10:10.155
Continuous passive.

00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:11.240
Don't get confused.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.699
Incorrect auxiliary verb usage.

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:20.939
Using the wrong to be form for tense
or subject example, the book is wrote

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:26.910
instead of The book is written, small
mistakes, big impact, missing or

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.189
incorrect, past participant forgetting
V three or using V two instead.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.050
Example, the door was broke
instead of the door was broken.

00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:43.095
Unnecessary use of passive voice,
overusing passive voice when active would

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:48.975
be clearer and more concise, especially
when the doer is known and important.

00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:50.510
Be direct when you can.

00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:56.055
Changing meaning during conversion
never alter the original meaning

00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:57.795
or emphasis of the sentence.

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:03.225
During conversion, the essence must
remain attempting to pacify int

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:07.935
transitive verbs, trying to convert
sentences with int transitive verbs.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.495
No direct object.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:14.740
Example sleep arrive into passive
voice is grammatically incorrect.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.540
It simply doesn't work.

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:21.395
Incorrect placement of
by plus agent misplacing.

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:25.295
This phrase can make your
sentence sound awkward or unclear.

00:11:25.564 --> 00:11:26.495
Keep it neat.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.135
W Framework summary.

00:11:29.525 --> 00:11:32.435
Let's wrap up with our quick W framework.

00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:38.140
What active voice subject performs
passive voice subject receives?
