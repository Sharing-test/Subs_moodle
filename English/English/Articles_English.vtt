Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on articles.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.990
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.485
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.265
All right, so what exactly are articles?

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:22.845
Well, my friends, they are those
tiny, yet undeniably mighty words

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.575
that define a noun as specific or a.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.390
Unspecific in English.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.540
We've got a neat trio of these
helpers A and and the their main

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.790
job to pop up right before nouns and
give us a clear hint whether that

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.700
noun is general or super specific.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.150
Think of them like miniature linguistic
detectives, always giving us crucial clues

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.550
about the noun that's coming up next.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.675
Pretty smart for tiny words, eh?

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.280
Indefinite articles a and an first up.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.230
We have a dynamic duo of
indefinite articles, A and an.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.630
Now A is your trusty go-to for
singular countable nouns that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.610
begin with a consonant sound.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.110
Yes, my friends.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.910
The sound is the absolute key
here, not just the letter itself.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.910
For instance, you'd correctly
say a book, a cat, and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.669
interestingly enough, a university.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.919
Why a university?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.949
Because university cunningly kicks off
with a U sound, which is distinctly

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.139
a consonant sound not a vowel.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.360
Tricky little devils, aren't they?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.179
Then there's an, this one's reserved
for singular countable nouns that

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.460
properly begin with a vowel sound.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.560
You know, the good old A-E-I-O-U
sounds that roll off the tongue,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.110
so it's logically an apple, an
elephant, and another one to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.600
always watch out for an hour.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.230
Why?

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:08.585
Because the edge in our is delightfully
silent, making the word start with an

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:11.765
sound, which is clearly a vowel sound.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:15.785
See, it's all about the
sound, not just the letter.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.885
A real ear opener, isn't it?

00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:24.045
These articles are affectionately called
indefinite for a very good reason.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:28.575
They specifically refer to a
general or unspecific noun.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:34.334
For instance, if I casually tell
you I want a pen, it simply means

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:39.075
any pen from the universe of pens,
not some particular Parker Pen.

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:40.935
I've been eyeing for ages.

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:41.685
Got it.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:48.885
Definite article the Now let's turn our
attention to the big boss of articles.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:54.255
The this incredibly versatile
article can be confidently used

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:59.025
before singular or plural nouns,
and remarkably even whether they're

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:01.755
countable or gloriously uncountable.

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:07.225
The secret sauce, it's employed
when the noun is specific or quite

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.975
conveniently has already been
mentioned in the conversation.

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:16.495
For instance, you'd instinctively
say the sun because there's only

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:18.355
one shining brightly, right?

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:22.285
The Eiffel Tower, a truly unique landmark.

00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:26.424
The books on the table, we are
talking about specific books,

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:28.375
not just any random books.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.315
Or the water in the glass, that particular
water, not just water in general, a. The

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:42.105
is perfectly named the definite article
because it precisely points to a specific

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:47.145
noun that both the speaker and the
listener are already perfectly aware of.

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:53.565
Imagine I say with a knowing wink,
please pass me the book you immediately

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:57.435
without a second thought know
exactly which book I'm talking about.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.250
Perhaps the one sitting right next
to you, because its identity is

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.710
mutually understood by both parties.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.340
It's like a secret
code, but not so secret.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.230
More like an open secret, truly.

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:16.185
Understanding the correct
usage of a and and the isn't

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:17.954
merely a trivial grammar rule.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:22.425
It's absolutely fundamental to
constructing grammatically correct

00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:27.105
and crystal clear sentences in
English, and who doesn't love clarity,

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:31.065
especially when those precious
marks are at stake in your exam.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.720
Real world relevance.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.080
Now, why should you, my friend, genuinely
care about these seemingly tiny articles?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.780
Well, their precise use ensures
absolute clarity in official

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.820
communication, which let me tell you,
is super crucial for professionals.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:56.055
It helps them meticulously avoid
any misinterpretation in those

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:58.034
intricate financial documents.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:02.805
And of course, during vital
customer interactions, think of

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:07.560
it, a tiny misplaced, uh, or the
could potentially cost millions.

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:14.135
It also reflects a keen attention to
detail, which is undoubtedly a key

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:18.785
trait for accurate record keeping
and highly effective communication.

00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:21.635
No room for her attitude here.

00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:26.135
Every comma, every article
counts like cold cash.

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:28.595
Breakdown of question types.

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:33.365
You might be thinking, professor,
do I get a dedicated section

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:35.405
solely for articles in my exam?

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:42.005
Well, not exactly, but fret not the
correct usage of articles is implicitly

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:46.865
tested across various question types
that you will definitely encounter.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.260
Based on past exam patterns for your
exam, you'll frequently find your rock

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.180
solid understanding of articles being
assessed in these popular formats.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.800
First, there's error spotting 40 to
50%, a significant chunk, almost half.

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:08.674
Of error spotting questions
involve identifying grammatical

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:10.234
errors, and guess what?

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:14.794
Incorrect or missing article
usage is often a prime suspect.

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:19.955
Candidates need to pinpoint sentences
where articles are used improperly

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:24.844
or gasp, completely omitted when
they were desperately required.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.170
Next we have sentence improvement
slash correction, 25 to 30%.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.610
These questions present a sentence
with a highlighted part that

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.680
practically screams for correction.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.180
More often than not, the required
correction involves rectifying

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.170
article related errors to make
the sentence grammatically sound.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.500
It's like being a grammar doctor,
diagnosing and curing, and trust me,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.780
your sentences will thank you for it.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.600
Then comes fill in the blanks.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.430
20 to 25%.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.440
These single or double blank fillers
frequently demand that you choose

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.930
the most appropriate article A
and the or sometimes very wisely.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.370
No article at all to complete the
sentence, making it meaningful

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.140
and grammatically impeccable.

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:20.185
It's like a word puzzle, but with
articles, a bit like finding that

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:22.585
last elusive piece of a jigsaw.

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:26.664
And finally, the close test, five to 10%.

00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:31.555
Although a tad less direct close
tests may occasionally include

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:35.905
blanks that require the clever
insertion of an appropriate article.

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:39.615
This helps in maintaining the
passage's overall coherence

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:41.445
and grammatical accuracy.

00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:46.305
It's truly like filling in the missing
pieces of a grand linguistic jigsaw

00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:51.405
where articles are often the tiny but
absolutely essential corner pieces.

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:56.145
Understanding these article rules,
my friends, is absolutely crucial

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:59.925
for excelling in these sections
because let's be brutally honest.

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:05.375
Errors in article usage can effortlessly
lead to incorrect answers, and we

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:07.445
certainly don't want that, do we?

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:13.205
Every single mark is precious,
like gold dust formulas and tricks.

00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:17.224
Now, articles aren't like
your typical math problems.

00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:19.955
They don't come with traditional formulas.

00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:25.715
But their usage follows some pretty
specific rules which we can cleverly

00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:31.265
memorize as super handy tricks for quick
application in your competitive exam.

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:34.475
These are your secret weapons if you will.

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.049
First trick the vowel sound rule.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:44.170
Remember it's all, and I mean all about
the sound, not just the letter itself.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.710
Always use an before words that genuinely
start with a vowel sound, for example.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.965
It's correctly an our and
an honest man trying to say.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.660
Our just sounds totally wrong, doesn't it?

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.150
A bit like nails on a blackboard.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.510
Then we have the consonant sound rule
use, uh, before words that start with

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.699
a consonant sound, even if the first
letter visually appears to be a vowel.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.240
Case in point, a university, a
European, once again, the sound is

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.550
truly your best friend here guiding you.

00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:27.925
Perfectly next, the golden rule
of specific versus general.

00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:30.715
This is absolutely fundamental.

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:36.385
Use the for specific nouns, those
that have already been mentioned are

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:42.689
inherently unique or are commonly
known to everyone and use A or N

00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:45.235
for general or unspecific nouns.

00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:46.495
Simple as that.

00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:50.155
No rocket science
involved for unique nouns.

00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:54.715
Always, and I mean, always
use the, think about it.

00:09:54.895 --> 00:10:00.205
There's only one, the sun, one the
moon, and one glorious the earth.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:03.175
Don't you dare mess with uniqueness.

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:05.095
It deserves its definite.

00:10:05.095 --> 00:10:12.745
Article with superlatives always, always
use the before superlative adjectives like

00:10:12.865 --> 00:10:16.225
the best, the tallest, the most beautiful.

00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:20.105
Because, well, they are the
most of something, aren't they?

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:23.945
They're top tier when it
comes to musical instruments.

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:27.905
Also use the, so it's
the piano, the guitar.

00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:30.785
This is about the instrument itself.

00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:35.555
For geographical features,
definitely use the before names of

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:40.385
rivers, oceans, deserts, mountain
ranges, and groups of islands.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.690
Examples Abound, the Nile, the
Pacific Ocean, the Sahara, the

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.670
Himalayas, the Philippines.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:53.310
It's like giving them a proper
regal title, isn't it Now, countries

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.410
or states special cases, this my
friends, is a super common pitfall.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:04.020
Use the for countries that proudly
include words like kingdom states

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.325
or republic in their names.

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:07.825
Think the United States.

00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:12.685
The United Kingdom, but for most
other countries, like our very own

00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:15.625
India or France, no, the is needed.

00:11:15.955 --> 00:11:18.625
Please don't add the before India.

00:11:18.655 --> 00:11:19.015
Okay?

00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:20.575
We are not that special.

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:28.185
For professions, always use her or an
so he's a doctor, she's an engineer.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.125
Easy peasy, like making a cup of chai.

00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:35.625
Regarding meals, generally
speaking, no article is used.

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:41.925
We simply say we had dinner, but if
it's a specific meal, a memorable one,

00:11:42.074 --> 00:11:44.745
then the gracefully comes into play.

00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:49.400
For instance, the dinner we had
last night was absolutely delicious.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:55.350
Ah, that specific delicious dinner
etched in memory For diseases,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.449
mostly no article is used.

00:11:57.689 --> 00:11:59.790
You'd say he has measles.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:06.090
However, there are indeed a few sneaky
exceptions like the flu or the mumps.

00:12:06.364 --> 00:12:09.005
Just make sure to
remember those exceptions.

00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:14.675
They pop up often and for languages,
absolutely no article is used.

00:12:14.854 --> 00:12:17.435
You simply state, she speaks English.

00:12:17.614 --> 00:12:19.474
No need for the English.

00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:20.944
It just sounds odd.

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:22.925
Same goes for spots.

00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:24.454
No article is needed.

00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:30.185
You confidently say he plays football,
not the football, unless you mean the

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:33.214
specific ball itself when referring to.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:38.475
Plural nouns generally in a general
sense, typically no article is used.

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:41.564
For example, dogs are loyal animals.

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:44.415
We're talking about all
dogs in general here.

00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:47.295
Write not just one specific canine.

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:52.635
Similarly for abstract nouns, in a
general sense, no article is used.

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:54.944
Honesty is the best policy.

00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:56.594
Pure wisdom, isn't it?

00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:59.204
As old as the hills finally.

00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:05.895
Generally, no article is used before
proper nouns, names of people, specific

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:10.905
places or organizations, unless of
course they are part of a specific

00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:17.150
title or a truly unique entity like the
Times of India or the United Nations.

00:13:17.885 --> 00:13:21.785
These are the exceptional cases
you'll master with practice.

00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:26.824
These tricks, my friends, are your quick
reference guide for common article usage

00:13:26.824 --> 00:13:29.285
scenarios in your competitive exams.

00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:33.275
They're like your super handy
cheat sheet, but for real, your

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:35.435
brain's secret weapon, if you will.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.295
Methods of solving.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.140
When you are tackling questions related
to articles in the English section

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.630
of your exam, having a systematic and
disciplined approach is absolutely key.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.400
Here are the step-by-step methods for
solving these problems, covering the

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.069
most important and distinct approaches.

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:59.895
First up, let's talk about
contextual analysis for fill

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:01.605
in the blanks or close test.

00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:06.885
Step one, read the entire sentence
or the whole passage carefully.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.655
Your first goal is to understand
the overall meaning and context.

00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:16.755
This crucial step helps you determine
if the noun you are dealing with is

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.665
specific or more general in its usage.

00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:20.835
Step two.

00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:25.605
Next, identify the noun or
nouns immediately proceeding

00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:26.865
or following the blank.

00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:31.605
You need to quickly figure out
if the noun is singular, plural,

00:14:31.935 --> 00:14:33.795
countable, or uncountable.

00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:34.995
Step three.

00:14:35.295 --> 00:14:37.335
Now, check for specificity.

00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:40.515
Has this noun been mentioned
before in the text?

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:45.945
Is it inherently unique in some way,
or is it something that's commonly

00:14:45.945 --> 00:14:47.775
known to both the speaker and the.

00:14:48.775 --> 00:14:53.185
If the answer is yes to any of these
questions, then you should definitely

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:55.735
consider using the step four.

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:57.475
Time to check for sound.

00:14:57.955 --> 00:15:02.125
If the noun is singular and
countable, quickly determine if it

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:06.745
starts with a vowel sound, and if
so, use an or a consonant sound.

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:12.870
In which case, use a, remember sound
is the real decider here, my friends.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.260
It's your ears, not just
your eyes doing the work.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.310
Step five, don't forget to
consider general statements.

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:26.099
If the noun refers to something in a
broad general sense, for example, dogs

00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:30.935
are loyal, then surprise, surprise,
no article might be needed at all.

00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:32.540
Step six.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.930
This is where your elimination
strategy comes in handy.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:40.609
Based on all the rules you've
meticulously learned, start eliminating

00:15:40.609 --> 00:15:44.510
the clearly incorrect article
choices from the given options.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:45.650
Step seven.

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:50.239
Finally insert your chosen
article into the blank and reread

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:52.250
the entire sentence or passage.

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.810
Make absolutely sure it flows
grammatically and logically.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.910
If it sounds right, it probably is
right like a. Perfectly balanced curry.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.890
Next, we move to the error spotting
or sentence improvement approach.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.910
Step one, read the sentence
very, very carefully.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.590
Your first task is to identify all
the different parts of the sentence.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.915
Step two, focus your attention
like a laser beam on nouns and

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.880
the words directly preceding them.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.990
Pay extra close attention
to where articles or their

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.880
absence are currently used.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:34.520
Step three Now apply your article
rules systematically and without fail.

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:40.099
Check each instance of an article, or
its lack thereof against all the rules of

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:46.640
definite, indefinite, and zero articles
is A or and used correctly with singular

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.709
countable nouns and their specific sounds
is the used correctly for specific,

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.349
unique, or previously mentioned nouns.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.910
And most importantly is a zero article,
meaning no article at all correctly

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:06.040
applied for general, plural or uncountable
nouns, proper nouns or those special

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.560
categories like languages or sports.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.470
Do a thorough, meticulous
check, my friend.

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:16.944
Step four, identify the error if any
of your cherished rules is violated.

00:17:17.155 --> 00:17:18.265
Congratulations.

00:17:18.444 --> 00:17:23.605
That part of the sentence unmistakably
contains the error you found the culprit.

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:24.745
Step five.

00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:29.785
If it's a sentence improvement question,
then it's time to suggest the correction,

00:17:30.085 --> 00:17:31.705
determine the correct article.

00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:35.525
Or the precise absence of an
article that would make the sentence

00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:37.505
grammatically sound and perfect.

00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:40.925
Step six, finally verify your correction.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:45.425
We read the corrected sentence to
ensure it is grammatically flawless

00:17:45.635 --> 00:17:50.195
and crucially that it retains its
original meaning, no changes in

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.295
meaning only grammar improvement.

00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:54.545
We are polishing gems here, folks.

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:59.105
These methods, my friends, emphasize
a rule-based and contextual

00:17:59.105 --> 00:18:00.995
understanding of article usage.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.310
This is absolutely crucial for
solving related questions in your

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:10.139
exam, so practice them diligently
and success will surely follow

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.810
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.450
Mastering articles for your exam involves
not just knowing the rules by heart,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.909
but also cleverly applying some super
smart techniques to save your precious

00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:29.855
time, and more importantly, avoid those
pesky common pitfalls that trap many.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.910
First up, the mighty sound, not letter.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.920
This my friends, is the golden rule
for choosing between, uh and Anne.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:44.440
It's always about the sound of the
very next word, not just the letter.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.640
It starts with quickly pronounce
the word in your head to determine

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.810
if it starts with a vowel.

00:18:50.585 --> 00:18:53.435
Then it's an or a consonant sound.

00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:58.775
Then it's, uh, this lightning fast
check prevents those classic errors

00:18:58.895 --> 00:19:01.595
with words like r or university.

00:19:01.985 --> 00:19:06.125
It's like a quick mental
pronunciation test that never fails.

00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:11.710
Next, understand the concept of first
mention versus subsequent mention.

00:19:12.405 --> 00:19:16.695
When you introduce a noun for the
very first time, in a general sense,

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:20.325
use a or an but listen carefully.

00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:25.035
When that very same noun is
mentioned again, it immediately

00:19:25.035 --> 00:19:27.285
transforms into something specific.

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:32.715
So you absolutely must use the,
this is a super common pattern.

00:19:32.835 --> 00:19:35.685
You'll spot frequently
in reading comprehension.

00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:36.975
And close tests.

00:19:37.334 --> 00:19:39.074
Keep a keen eye out for it.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:46.245
Remember this mantra, unique or known,
the if the noun is one of a kind, truly

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:52.364
unique, like the sun or the moon, or
if it's identity is already perfectly

00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:57.614
clear to both the speaker and listener
like the door or the principle, then.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:03.570
Always, always use the, this shortcut
helps you quickly identify when

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.230
to pull out that definite article
without a moment's hesitation.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.640
For general plurals or
uncountable, no article.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.920
This one's a realtime saver.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:19.530
Trust me, for plural nouns or uncountable
nouns used in a general sense, you

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.990
typically don't need any article at all.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.560
For example, you say water is essential.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.610
General versus the water in
this glass is cold specific.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.960
This neat trick saves you
time by elegantly eliminating

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.460
unnecessary articles.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.470
Think smart, not hard.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.100
My friends.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:45.790
Now, for categorize exceptions, instead
of trying to memorize every single rule in

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.745
isolation like a parrot, try intelligently
grouping common exceptions together.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:56.055
For instance, remember that there is
used with certain countries like the

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:59.475
USA, the uk, but not with most others.

00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:05.325
Similarly, recall those common phrases
that just omit articles like Go to school

00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:12.195
or by bus categorizing makes learning
much, much easier and more efficient when

00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:14.205
faced with multiple choice questions.

00:21:14.445 --> 00:21:17.175
Employ the clever elimination strategy.

00:21:17.555 --> 00:21:22.415
If you are ever unsure, just try to knock
out options that are clearly incorrect

00:21:22.595 --> 00:21:24.575
based on your basic article rules.

00:21:24.905 --> 00:21:29.675
For example, if a singular countable
noun starts with a vowel sound, you can

00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:32.315
instantly eliminate any option that has.

00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:37.145
Uh, it's like being a detective,
ruling out suspects and catching

00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:38.700
the grammatical culprits.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.725
And here's a subtle but
surprisingly powerful technique.

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:44.285
Read aloud subtly.

00:21:44.754 --> 00:21:49.284
Sometimes just reading the sentence
aloud, even silently in your head

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.564
during the exam, please don't disturb.

00:21:51.564 --> 00:21:56.665
Your neighbors can help you catch awkward
phrasing or incorrect article usage.

00:21:56.845 --> 00:21:58.585
That just doesn't sound right.

00:21:58.975 --> 00:22:03.504
This intuitive check beautifully
compliments your rule-based application.

00:22:03.745 --> 00:22:04.540
Trust your ears.

00:22:04.585 --> 00:22:08.304
Sometimes they have a good
sense of rhythm even in grammar.

00:22:08.685 --> 00:22:11.775
Finally, practice with context, please.

00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:17.355
My friends, don't just memorize rules in
isolation, like reciting poetry, practice,

00:22:17.355 --> 00:22:22.575
applying them relentlessly in context,
especially by solving past year papers.

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:27.285
This is how you truly understand
the nuances of article usage in

00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:29.475
realistic exam like scenarios.

00:22:29.835 --> 00:22:33.585
The more you practice, the more
confident and swift you'll become.

00:22:33.705 --> 00:22:34.845
So go on.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.770
Apply them.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.900
Your scores will surely thank you.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.400
Later, I promise common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.440
All right, my friends.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.840
Let's delve into those sneaky common
pitfalls that can cost you marks.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.910
Understanding these mistakes can
seriously help you avoid losing

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.390
those precious points in the
English section of your exam.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.560
Mistake one using, uh, before words
that start with a vowel letter,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:10.740
but deceptively have a consonant
sound Example, uh, university.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.730
Incorrect and university explanation.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.649
C, the choice between, uh,
and an is fundamentally a

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:22.050
sound game, not a letter game.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.659
University starts with a U sound,
which is distinctly a consonant

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:30.600
sound, so uh, is the correct choice.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.480
Don't fall for the Ulet trick.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:39.600
It's a classic trap mistake two,
using an before words that start

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.040
with a consonant letter, but
surprisingly have a vowel sound.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:51.590
Example, an R. Incorrect or R
explanation, similar to the above.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.330
R starts with an O sound,
which is a clear vowel sound.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:02.090
Hence Anne is absolutely correct
in this scenario, that silent

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.310
edge is the cunning culprit here.

00:24:04.855 --> 00:24:05.815
Mistake three.

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:10.735
Overusing the with general
plural or uncountable nouns.

00:24:11.065 --> 00:24:14.514
Example, the honesty is the best policy.

00:24:14.815 --> 00:24:20.695
Incorrect honesty is the best policy
explanation when you are talking about

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:23.305
general concepts or broad categories.

00:24:23.575 --> 00:24:27.175
Articles are often and
quite correctly omitted.

00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:30.325
Honesty in this sentence refers to the.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.990
Concept in its general sense, not
some specific brand of honesty.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.630
So know the needed here, my friend.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.070
Mistake four.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:45.070
Forgetting to use the, when referring
to unique or truly specific entities.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.970
Example.

00:24:46.335 --> 00:24:49.155
Sunrises in East incorrect.

00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:52.815
The sunrises in the East explanation.

00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:59.085
Both sun and east are either unique
like the sun itself or refer to

00:24:59.085 --> 00:25:01.725
specific directions or celestial bodies.

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:06.395
Therefore they unequivocally
require the definite article.

00:25:06.485 --> 00:25:11.555
The there's only one sun, isn't
there shining brightly on us?

00:25:11.555 --> 00:25:17.010
All mistake five unnecessarily
using articles with proper nouns.

00:25:17.605 --> 00:25:20.335
Example, I live in the India.

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:21.385
Incorrect.

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:23.215
I live in India.

00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:24.504
Explanation.

00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:29.665
Generally speaking, proper nouns,
which are names of countries, specific

00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:35.155
cities or individual people, do not
take articles unless of course they

00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:40.675
are part of a specific title or a
unique entity like the United States.

00:25:40.945 --> 00:25:41.335
So.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.450
Please don't say the India or the Mumbai.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.950
It sounds a bit off.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.390
Mistake six.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.650
Getting confused about article
usage with abstract nouns.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:57.240
Example, he has earned
knowledge of English incorrect.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.460
He has knowledge of English.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:05.050
Explanation knowledge is an
uncountable abstract noun unless

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.580
you are specifying it further.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.510
For instance, a vast knowledge,
it generally doesn't take

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.889
an indefinite article.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.100
Just saying knowledge is perfectly fine.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:22.120
Mistake seven, incorrect article usage
with diseases, meals, or sports example.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.975
He plays the cricket.

00:26:24.535 --> 00:26:25.195
Incorrect.

00:26:25.254 --> 00:26:26.725
He plays cricket.

00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:33.025
Generally, no article is used before the
names of sports, meals or most diseases.

00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:37.705
Yes, there are a few exceptions,
like the flu or the mumps,

00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:39.625
but remember the general rule.

00:26:39.935 --> 00:26:45.034
So it's always play cricket, not
play the cricket, unless you're

00:26:45.034 --> 00:26:48.845
talking about a specific cricket
game, then the might apply.

00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:54.155
Being acutely aware of these common
errors, my friends can significantly

00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:58.835
improve your accuracy in your
exam, so keep them firmly in mind.

00:26:59.449 --> 00:27:01.580
WH framework summary.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:07.010
Let's quickly sum it all up with
our trustee, WH framework, shall we?

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.500
It's like our quick revision guide.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.169
So what are articles?

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:19.280
They are those essential little words,
like a and and the that precisely specify

00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:25.639
whether a noun is definite or indefinite,
and why do we even bother using them.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.290
Because they provide crucial
clarity and precision in our

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:35.150
communication, which is absolutely
vital for grammatical correctness.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.980
When do we deploy them?

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:42.410
They are always used before nouns
to clearly indicate specificity,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.020
generality, or uniqueness.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.790
Where are they applied?

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.220
Oh, practically everywhere.

00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:53.485
In all forms of English
communication, both written and

00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:55.885
spoken, you can't escape them.

00:27:56.215 --> 00:27:58.135
Who needs to know this thoroughly?

00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:03.805
Well, frankly, everyone who uses the
English language from friends like

00:28:03.805 --> 00:28:08.875
you, preparing for competitive exams
to seasoned professionals in any field.

00:28:09.115 --> 00:28:14.784
And finally, how do we master them by
diligently following specific rules

00:28:14.965 --> 00:28:17.034
that are based on the noun sound.

00:28:17.304 --> 00:28:22.254
Its inherent specificity and the
overall context in which it's used.

00:28:22.615 --> 00:28:26.695
It's like learning the secret
handshake of English grammar, truly.

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.595
Fully worked out examples.

00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:31.455
All right, my friends.

00:28:31.725 --> 00:28:35.625
Time to see all these
fantastic rules in action.

00:28:35.835 --> 00:28:40.905
Here are some fully worked out
examples to beautifully illustrate

00:28:40.905 --> 00:28:43.365
the application of article rules.

00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:46.905
Just like what you might
encounter in your exam.

00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:48.645
Pay close attention.

00:28:49.425 --> 00:28:51.645
Example, one question.

00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:56.895
Choose the most appropriate article
to complete the sentence she

00:28:56.895 --> 00:29:00.255
is, dash, honest Woman Options.

00:29:00.495 --> 00:29:06.585
A, uh, B, and C. The
D No article required.

00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:10.425
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.895
Solution, step one.

00:29:13.165 --> 00:29:18.235
First, carefully analyze the word
that immediately follows the blank,

00:29:18.504 --> 00:29:21.054
that word my friend is honest.

00:29:21.294 --> 00:29:26.814
Step two, now determine the sound
of the first letter of honest.

00:29:27.205 --> 00:29:31.375
Although honest visually starts
with the letter edge, that

00:29:31.465 --> 00:29:33.595
edge is completely silent.

00:29:33.935 --> 00:29:40.145
The word actually begins with a clear
vowel sound just like the O in Ont.

00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:46.835
Step three, apply the correct rule
for indefinite articles since the word

00:29:46.835 --> 00:29:53.345
begins with a vowel sound, the indefinite
article and is the perfect undisputed fit.

00:29:53.675 --> 00:29:58.955
Step four, form the complete sentence
by inserting a chosen article.

00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:00.245
There you have it.

00:30:00.514 --> 00:30:02.554
She is an honest woman.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.840
Sounds just right, doesn't it?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.260
As smooth as butter on toast, correct?

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.730
Answer B. An example two question.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.760
Identify the part of the sentence that
contains an error regarding article usage.

00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:23.034
He went to a hospital for
treatment after the accident.

00:30:23.544 --> 00:30:24.034
Options.

00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:29.679
A. He went to B. A
hospital C for treatment.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.360
D after the accident.

00:30:32.055 --> 00:30:36.465
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:42.405
Step one, let's meticulously examine
each part of the sentence for any

00:30:42.435 --> 00:30:45.525
instance of article usage or its absence.

00:30:45.765 --> 00:30:49.155
Step two, focus
specifically on the phrase.

00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:50.355
A hospital.

00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:55.784
Now, remember when we talk about
visiting general institutions like

00:30:55.784 --> 00:31:00.225
hospitals, schools, or churches,
if the purpose of your visit is

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:04.995
general, for example, to receive
treatment, to study, or to worship,

00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:08.024
then typically no article is needed.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.679
However, if you are referring to a
very specific building of a hospital,

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:15.020
then there would be appropriate.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.490
Step three, analyze the context
of this particular sentence.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:25.639
It clearly implies a general visit to
a hospital for treatment, not a trip to

00:31:25.639 --> 00:31:27.574
a particular named hospital building.

00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:30.304
The intention is general care.

00:31:30.574 --> 00:31:33.185
Step four, identify the error.

00:31:33.365 --> 00:31:33.995
Aha.

00:31:34.175 --> 00:31:39.395
The use of a before hospital is
incorrect in this general context.

00:31:39.635 --> 00:31:45.385
This is precisely where the error lies,
like a misplaced brick in a. Perfect wall.

00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:48.084
Step five suggests the correction.

00:31:48.354 --> 00:31:52.314
The grammatically correct phrase
for this general purpose should

00:31:52.314 --> 00:31:54.594
simply be went to hospital.

00:31:54.804 --> 00:31:55.824
Simple as that.

00:31:55.975 --> 00:31:58.554
Like solving a basic arithmetic problem.

00:31:58.764 --> 00:32:02.574
Correct answer be a hospital example.

00:32:02.574 --> 00:32:03.955
Three question.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.314
Fill in the blanks with
the most suitable articles.

00:32:08.125 --> 00:32:17.585
Sun Rises in East Options a. And
B, the the C and uh D no article,

00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:20.285
the understand the question before.

00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:25.145
Moving to explanation solution,
step one, let's look at the

00:32:25.145 --> 00:32:27.575
first blank, which precedes sun.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:33.695
Sun is, as we all know, a truly
unique celestial body and for unique

00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:38.765
objects like this, the definite
article, there is always used, no

00:32:38.765 --> 00:32:41.405
debate there, clear as daylight like.

00:32:41.515 --> 00:32:42.925
Perfectly brood chai.

00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:43.915
Step two.

00:32:44.185 --> 00:32:49.915
Now let's analyze the second blank,
which is before East East refers

00:32:49.915 --> 00:32:54.625
to a very specific direction for
directions, especially when they're

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:59.305
used in conjunction with celestial
bodies or as a specific location.

00:32:59.515 --> 00:33:03.235
The definite article there
is again, the correct choice.

00:33:03.385 --> 00:33:04.735
It points directly.

00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:05.955
To that direction.

00:33:06.195 --> 00:33:11.925
Step three, combine both articles
since both blanks unambiguously require

00:33:11.925 --> 00:33:14.265
the, that's a definitive answer.

00:33:14.505 --> 00:33:20.025
Step four, form the complete sentence
by putting everything together so the

00:33:20.025 --> 00:33:22.635
complete grammatically sound sentences.

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:25.635
The sun rises in the east.

00:33:25.905 --> 00:33:26.475
Perfect.

00:33:26.565 --> 00:33:28.275
Like a well-oiled machine.

00:33:28.545 --> 00:33:29.565
Correct answer.

00:33:29.715 --> 00:33:32.145
Be the thank you.

00:33:32.235 --> 00:33:34.035
See you in the next lecture.
