Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on preposition.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.020
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.320
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.070
All right, so what
exactly is a preposition?

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.259
Think of it like this, my friend.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.320
A preposition is a small but very
powerful word, or sometimes a group

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.320
of words that we use right before a
noun, a pronoun, or even a noun phrase.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.330
Its main job to show you directions,
tell you about time, pinpoint a place,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.360
or even describe spatial relationships.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.570
Sometimes it just introduces an object.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.260
Simple.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.290
They are truly the
bridges of your sentence.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.599
Connecting one part to another and setting
up a clear relationship between them.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.700
Think of them as small but mighty
words that tell you precisely where.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:01.695
When or how something is
connected to something else.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:05.775
It's like finding the exact
pin on Google Maps for your

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.515
sentence structure, isn't it?

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.815
These little guys, they
make all the difference.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:11.625
Trust me.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.360
For instance, consider these examples.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.280
The book is on the table here
on tells us the location.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.410
She arrived at 3:00 PM at specifies the
time he walked into the room into shows.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.900
The direction I am interested in
music, in highlights the relationship.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.539
Real world relevance.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.240
Now, why is understanding these little
linguistic gems so critical, especially

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.520
for someone aiming to be a professional?

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:50.009
Well, my friend, precise communication
is not just important, it's paramount.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.600
Using the correct preposition
ensures crystal clear understanding

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.009
in all your official documents
during customer interactions and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.229
in those crucial financial reports.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.920
Imagine a small misunderstanding
due to a wrong on or in.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.200
It could have significant implications
like getting a loan approved in

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.480
Tuesday instead of on Tuesday.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.130
Accuracy in language, just like
accuracy in numbers, builds

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.730
trust and helps maintain those
high professional standards.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.185
No confusion, no re What
did they mean moments?

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.430
Just clear communication.

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:32.805
Breakdown of question types
based on past English language

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.665
exam patterns for your exam.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:39.555
Questions related to prepositions
mainly pop up in a few common formats,

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.015
so let's break them down, shall we?

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:46.905
First up, we have fill in the
blanks, which can be single or double

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:51.195
blanks, making up approximately
30 to 40% of the questions.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.320
Here, my friend.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.430
You just need to pick the
absolutely correct preposition or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.770
prepositions to complete a sentence.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.420
It's like finding the missing piece
of a jigsaw puzzle, but with words.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.700
Next, we have error spotting
usually around 30 to 35%.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.310
This is where you play detective.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.140
You identify the part of a sentence
that has a grammatical error, and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.940
more often than not, it's that sneaky,
incorrect, or missing preposition.

00:03:21.015 --> 00:03:22.184
Playing hide and seek.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.535
Then comes sentence improvement
of phrase replacement accounting

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:28.904
for approximately 15 to 20%.

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:33.434
In these questions, you'll see an
underlined part of a sentence, and

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:38.385
your job is to replace it with a more
grammatically sound or appropriate option.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:40.274
Guess what's frequently tested here?

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:42.619
Tested yes are Dear prepositions.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.780
Finally, there's the close test,
which is about 10 to 15% of the pie.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.269
This is a passage with multiple blanks,
and you have to select the most suitable

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.609
words, including prepositions from the
given options to complete the entire text.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.910
It's like filling in the
blanks, but on a grander scale.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.290
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.670
Now, don't expect any
complicated algebraic formulas

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.170
for prepositions, my friend.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.090
They aren't numbers after all,
but they certainly follow rules

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.399
and common patterns, which if you
memorize are like your secret weapons.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.450
Here are some key tricks and
rules to lock into your brain.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.450
Let's talk about prepositions of time.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.130
First, you use.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:35.685
At for a very specific time, like at
6:00 PM at midnight, or even at dawn.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.505
Think of it as a precise clock hand.

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:45.885
Then there's on for days and dates,
such as on Monday on October 26th, or

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:53.474
on my birthday, easy Write and in is for
months, years, seasons, or longer periods.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.895
So it's in July in 2023.

00:04:57.075 --> 00:05:01.125
In winter or in the morning
or evening, simple as chi.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:04.094
Moving on to prepositions of place.

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:09.825
Opposition again at is for a specific
point or address, like at the

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.795
bus stop or at 24 B Main Street.

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:18.495
It's very particular on is for a
surface or a line such as on the

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:21.224
table, on the wall, or on the road.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:24.855
Picture it resting
directly on something and.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:30.414
In is for an enclosed space or
a large area, so it's in the

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:33.175
room in India or in the box.

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:34.615
Think inside.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:39.445
Next up, prepositions of
movement or direction use.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:39.865
Two.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:45.414
When you are going towards a destination,
like go to school or travel to Paris,

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:52.045
it's about reaching a point into means
entering an enclosed space, such as jump

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:54.685
into the pool or put it into the bag.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.880
It shows movement inside and onto is
for moving to a surface, like step onto

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.219
the stage or throw it onto the roof.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.880
Think of placing something
on top with movement.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.700
Now this is a big one.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.229
Fixed prepositions.

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.765
These are like best friends
that never leave each other.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:20.745
Many verbs and a objectives are just
followed by specific prepositions.

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:22.575
No ifs, ands, or buts.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:26.685
You just have to memorize these
combinations like you memorize

00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:28.395
your favorite biani recipe.

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:36.284
Common ones include accused of afraid
of approved, of belong to believe in,

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.335
benefit from, depend on or upon deal with.

00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:47.885
Familiar with Fond of Full Off, good
at grateful to, or four interested

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:54.875
in, insist on, listen to look at,
look for, or look after proud of,

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:58.445
prevent From Responsible for rely on.

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:04.530
Succeed in suffering from talk
to or about, think of or about.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.409
Don't forget prepositional phrases.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.239
These are common phrases that actually
work like prepositions themselves.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.640
Things like according to because
of in front of, or due to, they

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.890
function as a single unit, my friend.

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:22.725
And here's a super important trick.

00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:25.875
Sometimes no preposition is required.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:27.765
Yes, you heard that right?

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:30.855
Some verbs just don't need a preposition.

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:35.355
When they are followed by an object,
for example, you discuss something,

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:41.115
not discuss about something, you enter
somewhere, not enter into somewhere.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.020
You accompany someone, not
accompany with someone.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.060
Remember these and you'll save
marks and your brain cells too, from

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.820
unnecessary confusion because who
needs that stress methods of solving?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.650
All right, my friend.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.000
Let's get down to the brass tacks
of how to tackle these questions.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.040
Here are some step-by-step methods
for approaching the common question

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.290
types involving prepositions.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.800
Four, fill in the blanks questions.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.830
Step one, read the sentence carefully
First, understand the overall

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.200
meaning and context of the sentence.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.530
What's the story the sentence
is trying to tell you?

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.980
Step two, identify the relationship.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.720
Determine what kind of relationship
the blank needs to express.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.659
Is it time, place, direction, a
cause possession, or something else?

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:42.225
Step three, consider the word
before or after the blank.

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:48.585
Look for words, adjectives, or nouns that
often pair up with a specific preposition.

00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:52.005
Remember those fixed prepositions
we just talked about?

00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:56.115
Step four, test each option mentally.

00:08:56.145 --> 00:09:00.825
Insert each given preposition option
into the blank and see which one

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:05.085
sounds grammatically correct and
makes perfect sense in the context.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:06.945
It's like a trial run.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.520
Step five, eliminate incorrect options.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.680
Ruthlessly rule out the options that
clearly do not fit the grammatical

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.020
rules or the meaning of the sentence.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.660
Now for error spotting questions,
step one, read the entire

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.069
sentence, get a complete holistic
understanding of the sentence.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.210
Don't rush.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.420
Step two, scan for prepositions.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.260
Identify all the prepositions
used in the sentence.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.000
Circle them if you like.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.449
Step three, check prepositional usage.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.220
For each preposition you found,
ask yourself a few questions.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.660
Is this the correct preposition
for the word preceding it like

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.910
a verb, adjective, or noun.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:59.060
Does it accurately convey the intended
relationship, time, place, or direction?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.890
And most importantly, is the
preposition even needed here,

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:06.290
or is it just being redundant?

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:09.140
Step four, verify context.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.340
Make sure the preposition fits
the overall meaning and the

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.079
logical flow of the sentence.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.430
Know out of place.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.300
Words please.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.110
Step five, identify the erroneous segment.

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:26.775
Pinpoint the exact part of the sentence
where the preposition is used incorrectly

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:29.145
or perhaps is completely missing.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.349
And for sentence improvement or
phrase replacement questions.

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:38.790
Step one, read the original
sentence and the underlined part,

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:43.020
understand the specific phrase
or part that's being tested.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.640
What's the problem, child here?

00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:49.625
Step two, analyze the underlined
part for preposition errors.

00:10:50.075 --> 00:10:54.005
Figure out if the preposition in
the original sentence is wrong,

00:10:54.215 --> 00:10:56.975
extra, or just sounds a bit awkward.

00:10:57.395 --> 00:11:00.185
Step three, evaluate each option.

00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:05.945
Go through the given options, A,
B, C, D one by one, and compare

00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:07.290
them carefully with the original.

00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:11.715
Step four, check for grammatical
correctness and meaning.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:17.564
For each option, assess if it corrects
any errors in the original sentence and

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:22.965
if it maintains or actually improves
the sentences, meaning pay super close

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:27.825
attention to fixed prepositions and how
appropriate they are in the context.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:30.555
Step five, choose the best fit.

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:34.455
Select the option that makes
the sentence grammatically sound

00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:36.975
concise and absolutely clear.

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:42.104
If the original sentence is already
perfect, then by all means, choose

00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:44.204
the no improvement required option.

00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:45.944
Don't fix what isn't broken.

00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:46.035
Right.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.290
Shortcuts and smart techniques,
my friend in the exam hall.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.420
Every second counts, right?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.190
So these techniques are like your
express lane to solving preposition

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.890
questions and saving precious time.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.950
First, use contextual clues.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.750
Always, always read the
sentence in its entirety before.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.330
Even glancing at the options, the
words surrounding the blank or

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.890
the preposition often drops strong
hints about the relationship needed.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.960
For example, if it's a specific
time at is probably your best

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.880
bet if it's a surface, if.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:31.020
On is a strong candidate, like a
good friend you can always rely on.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.410
Then there's fixed
preposition recognition.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.719
A significant chunk of these questions
truly depends solely on knowing

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.439
which preposition consistently
follows a particular verb.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.230
Adjective or noun.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.480
If you recognize a common fixed
preposition combination, you can quickly

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.099
choose the answer without needing
to do a deep philosophical analysis.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.540
It's like knowing the answer even
before the question is fully asked.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:05.780
Employ the elimination strategy if
you are a bit unsure, first, eliminate

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.300
the most obviously incorrect options.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.640
This dramatically boosts your
chances of picking the right answer

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.380
from the choices that are left.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.640
For instance, if a blank clearly
needs a preposition of time,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.020
immediately cross out any options
that are prepositions of place.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.460
Smart, isn't it?

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:30.880
You can also listen to your ear, but
with caution while not foolproof.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.090
Sometimes a preposition just sounds right.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.910
You can use this as a. Quick initial
check, but always, and I mean always

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.460
back it up with proper grammatical
rules, especially for less common usages.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.410
This trick works better for those with
a strong, intuitive grasp of English

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.170
or who are practically native speakers.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.960
A parallelism check is also
useful in sentences that have

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.640
multiple clauses or phrases.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.510
Always check if prepositions
are used consistently, when

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.250
similar structures are involved.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:11.070
Maintain that rhythm, my friend, and
finally have no preposition awareness.

00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:15.865
Be very mindful of verbs that
simply do not require prepositions.

00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:22.375
Examples include verbs like comprise,
discuss, emphasize, accompany approach.

00:14:22.525 --> 00:14:23.875
Enter, or lack.

00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:28.824
A common mistake in exams is adding
a completely redundant preposition.

00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.645
When none is needed,
don't fall for that trap.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:34.735
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:39.505
All right, let's talk about the potholes
on the road to preposition mastery.

00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:44.625
Being aware of these common errors can
literally save you marks in your exam.

00:14:45.074 --> 00:14:49.844
One biggie is confusing in,
on and at for place and time.

00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:55.005
The mistake often is using in
for a very specific point or at

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.405
for a large area the correction.

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:02.359
Remember the size rule like a traffic
signal at for a specific point.

00:15:02.815 --> 00:15:09.265
On for a line or surface and in for a
larger area or volume for time, it's

00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:14.815
at, for a specific time on for a day
or date and in for a longer period.

00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:15.535
Simple.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:20.605
Then there's misusing, fixed
prepositions saying Depend off

00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:23.485
instead of depend on or interested on.

00:15:23.605 --> 00:15:26.695
Instead of interested
in are classic blunders.

00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:27.735
The fix.

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:31.065
This absolutely requires
memorization, my friend.

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:35.385
When you learn new verbs or
adjectives, make it a habit to note

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:36.855
down the preposition they take.

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:42.945
Adding redundant prepositions is another
trap like saying, discussed about the

00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:45.420
matter when it should just be discussed.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.535
The matter, the correction, is to learn
verbs that are transitive, meaning they

00:15:50.535 --> 00:15:55.605
directly take an object and therefore do
not need a preposition before that object.

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:56.655
Verbs like this.

00:15:56.745 --> 00:16:00.645
Discuss, enter, comprise or
approach fall into this category.

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:03.135
Confusing between and among.

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:09.045
Also trips up many using between for more
than two items or among for exactly two.

00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:15.555
The rule is use between for two distinct
items or clearly defined individual items.

00:16:15.765 --> 00:16:17.145
Even if there are more than two.

00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:20.685
Use a monk when you are
referring to a group or more

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:22.755
than two undifferentiated items.

00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:27.485
It's about distinctness, not
just number and oh, incorrect.

00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:31.625
Prepositions after arrive,
many say arrive to a place.

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:32.555
No, no, no.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:37.805
The correction is to use arrive at
for specific places or points, like

00:16:37.865 --> 00:16:43.415
arrive at the airport and arrive in
for larger entities like cities or

00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:45.875
countries, such as arrive in Mumbai.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:49.600
Lastly, using prepositions
with passive voice errors.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:55.930
Often friends confuse by and with
the simple mantra is by indicates

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.240
the agent, meaning who did the action
while with indicates the instrument,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.640
meaning what was used to do the action.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.690
For instance, the door was
opened by the boy with a key.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.950
See the difference?

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.170
W framework summary.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.760
Let's quickly sum it up with our
classic W framework, shall we?

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.389
So what are prepositions?

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.790
They are those crucial words that
connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.770
to other words in a sentence.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.720
Beautifully showing relationships
like time, place, direction, or.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.300
Even Cause why are they so important?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:34.810
You ask?

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:40.120
Because my friend, they are absolutely
crucial for clarity, precision,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.770
and grammatical correctness,
ensuring that your communication

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.020
is accurate in all contexts.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.760
No room for guesswork.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.440
When do we apply them?

00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:54.875
We apply them precisely when we
are establishing relationships

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:56.435
between different elements.

00:17:56.435 --> 00:18:02.405
In a sentence indicating time, location,
direction, or any other association

00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:04.925
you can think of, where are they used?

00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:06.635
Everywhere, boss.

00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:11.345
They are used extensively in
everyday conversation, in academic

00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:16.445
writing, in official documents, and
especially in workplace communication.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:17.535
Who uses them?

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:23.340
Well, every single speaker and
writer of English uses prepositions

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:28.050
and professionals like yourselves
benefit immensely from their correct

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.449
application for utmost clarity.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.189
And how are they applied?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.929
They are applied by understanding
their specific functions, whether

00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:39.294
it's time, place, or direction.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.070
And of course, by diligently
memorizing those common fixed

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.540
preposition combinations.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.300
Practice, practice.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.199
Practice.

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:49.699
Fully worked out.

00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:50.510
Examples.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.120
All right, enough theory, my friend.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.290
Let's dive into some practical,
fully worked out examples to

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.179
solidify our understanding.

00:18:59.419 --> 00:19:03.560
Ready Example one, fill
in the blanks question.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.834
The manager will preside
the meeting tomorrow.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:15.850
Options, A on B over C at D in
understand the question before

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.890
moving to explanation, step-by-step
solution with detailed explanation.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.920
Step one, analyze the verb, my friend.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.930
The verb here is preside.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:31.450
Step two, understand the meaning of
preside to preside means to be in the

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.860
position of authority, essentially to
be in charge of a meeting or a ceremony.

00:19:36.755 --> 00:19:39.845
Step three, recall your
fixed prepositions.

00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:43.115
Ah, this is where your
memory comes in handy.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:48.725
The word preside is always, and I mean
always followed by the preposition

00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:53.165
over when it means overseeing
a meeting or any formal event.

00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:55.955
Step four, evaluate the options.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:00.305
A on simply does not fit
the context of presiding.

00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:02.915
It sounds off like a flat tire.

00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:08.150
B. Over correctly forms the
phrasal verb preside over, which

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.430
perfectly means to be in charge.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.160
This one sounds like music to the ears.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.220
C at is generally used for specific
locations or times, again, not for

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.715
the act of presiding d. In is for
enclosed spaces or longer periods.

00:20:24.775 --> 00:20:27.175
Again, not for the act of presiding.

00:20:27.415 --> 00:20:30.085
Step five, select the correct option.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:35.395
So my friend, option B is the
only grammatically correct and

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.525
contextually appropriate choice here.

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:40.735
See how straightforward it
is once you know the rule.

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:47.925
Correct answer is option B over
example two error spotting question.

00:20:48.285 --> 00:20:53.595
The new policy will be effective
from first April and everyone must

00:20:53.595 --> 00:20:56.595
adhere with its guidelines options.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:04.010
A, the new policy B will be effective
from first April C, and everyone

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.290
must adhere with its guidelines.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.910
D, no error.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.570
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:21:14.115 --> 00:21:17.205
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:21.435
Step one, read the entire
sentence carefully, my friend.

00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:26.715
The new policy will be effective
from first April and everyone

00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:28.785
must adhere with its guidelines.

00:21:29.325 --> 00:21:33.105
Step two, scan for
prepositions and their usage.

00:21:33.405 --> 00:21:39.705
We have effective from first April, where
from is absolutely correct, indicating

00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:41.895
the starting point of effectiveness.

00:21:42.254 --> 00:21:45.254
Then we have adhere with its guidelines.

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.415
Hmm, a red flag perhaps.

00:21:47.775 --> 00:21:50.415
Step three, check for fixed prepositions.

00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:51.665
Aha.

00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:57.995
The verb adhere commonly takes the
preposition to not with, adhere to

00:21:58.175 --> 00:22:02.945
literally means to stick firmly to
something like rules or guidelines.

00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:04.595
It's like glue my friend.

00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:07.175
Step four, identify the error.

00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:12.665
The error as expected is in the
phrase adhere with its guidelines.

00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:14.165
It should be adhere.

00:22:14.445 --> 00:22:15.764
To its guidelines.

00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:21.465
This erroneous part is clearly in
segment C. Step five, conclude.

00:22:21.645 --> 00:22:24.645
So segment C contains the big error.

00:22:24.825 --> 00:22:25.365
Got it.

00:22:25.695 --> 00:22:31.575
Correct answer is option C. And everyone
must adhere with its guide guidelines.

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:35.415
Example, three sentence
improvement question.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:38.475
She is confident in
winning the competition.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.520
Options.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.649
A. Confident for winning.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.540
B. Confident of winning
C. Confident about to win.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.030
D. No improvement required.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.659
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.020
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.550
Step one, analyze the original
sentence and the underlined part.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.500
The original sentence is she is
confident in winning the competition.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.600
The preposition used here is in
step two, check the prepositional

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.280
usage with the adjective.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.760
Confident, my friend, the a confident.

00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:21.745
Typically demands the preposition
off when it's followed by ager,

00:23:22.344 --> 00:23:24.564
like winning or a noun phrase.

00:23:24.895 --> 00:23:29.455
Confident off conveys having
a strong belief in oneself or

00:23:29.635 --> 00:23:31.435
the certainty of an outcome.

00:23:31.614 --> 00:23:33.834
It's like saying, I'm sure of it.

00:23:34.104 --> 00:23:35.935
Step three, evaluate.

00:23:35.995 --> 00:23:41.064
Each option let's C. A
confident for winning four is

00:23:41.064 --> 00:23:42.655
just incorrect with confident.

00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:45.685
In this context, it's
like mixing oil and water.

00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:48.024
B, confident of winning.

00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:48.925
Aha.

00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:49.705
This is it.

00:23:50.034 --> 00:23:54.655
Off is the correct and most natural
preposition to use with confident

00:23:54.804 --> 00:23:58.645
when you are expressing belief in
the successful outcome of an action.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.370
Perfect fit like a custom made suit.

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:03.919
C. Confident about to win.

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:09.290
Now about to win implies that something
is going to happen very, very soon.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.790
This completely changes the meaning
from her belief in winning to the

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.590
immediate closeness of her win.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:21.590
Plus, it sounds grammatically awkward
with confident D. No improvement required.

00:24:21.965 --> 00:24:28.115
The original sentence uses in which while
not entirely disastrous, is less common

00:24:28.115 --> 00:24:33.155
and definitely less precise than off
with confident in this specific context.

00:24:33.245 --> 00:24:35.254
So improvement is needed.

00:24:35.524 --> 00:24:37.835
Step four, select the best option.

00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:41.764
Option B, without a doubt makes
the sentence grammatically

00:24:41.764 --> 00:24:43.925
correct and perfectly idiomatic.

00:24:44.195 --> 00:24:49.295
Perfect correct answer is
option B. Confident of winning.

00:24:49.685 --> 00:24:50.285
Thank you.

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:51.905
See you in the next lecture.
