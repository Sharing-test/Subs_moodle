Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on one word substitution.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
We're about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.930
with this tutorial concept.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.860
Explanation.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.720
One word substitution is a
linguistic concept where a single

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.270
word is used to replace a phrase.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.620
Or a clause making the sentence
more concise and impactful without

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.300
losing its original meaning.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.430
It's about expressing a lengthy
idea in a single precise term.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.290
This skill, my friend, is crucial
for effective communication and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.065
understanding vocabulary nuances.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:46.715
It enhances clarity and brevity in
both written and spoken language, and

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:52.175
demonstrates a command over language
and vocabulary, real world relevance.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:57.185
As a professional, clear and
concise communication is vital for

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.965
drafting reports and interacting
with clients effectively.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.390
Mastering one word substitutions
enhances your ability to articulate

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.179
complex financial concepts succinctly,
improving efficiency and professionalism

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.950
in all your communications.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.410
Clarity in communication is a
must, using precise terms to avoid

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.630
ambiguity in official documents.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.500
You get efficiency in reporting
by condensing lengthy descriptions

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.900
into brief, understandable phrases.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.580
It elevates your professional
correspondence, helps you quickly grasp

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.470
official jargon, enables effective
client interaction with clear and

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.270
concise explanations to customers,
and very importantly, improves your

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.475
time management by reducing the
time spent on reading and writing.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.300
Breakdown of question types
based on typical English

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.130
section patterns in your exam.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.630
One word substitution questions
usually appear in a few formats.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.880
The most common with a 60% frequency
is phrase to word conversion.

00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:08.215
Here a phrase or a detailed
description is given, and you need

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:12.295
to choose the single word that best
represents it from the options.

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.925
For example, a person who
is skilled in many different

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:18.685
areas, the answer is versatile.

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:23.215
Then at 25%, frequency
is sentence completion.

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:27.625
A sentence with a blank is provided,
and the blank needs to be filled with

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.885
a one word substitute that fits the
context of the surrounding phrase.

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:36.855
For instance, the study of ancient
societies is known as Dash.

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:42.255
The answer is archeology less
directly, maybe 10% of the time.

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:47.355
A question might test your understanding
of a one word substitute by asking for its

00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.025
synonym or antonym within a given context.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.135
And finally, in a less common
format, maybe 5% of the

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:55.935
time you might get a match.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:03:00.255
The following question, requiring
you to match phrases and words

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.845
from two columns correctly.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:03.965
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:09.485
Now, there are no mathematical formulas
for this, but here are some excellent

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.615
linguistic tricks and strategies.

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:14.225
Try root word analysis.

00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:18.095
Many English words share
Latin or Greek roots.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:24.275
Understanding roots like mal, bad or
fellow can help you deduce the meaning.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:30.725
Learn common prefixes and suffixes
like UN or ology to understand

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:32.705
how they modify word meanings.

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:37.745
Always pay close attention to
contextual close from surrounding words.

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:41.525
For strong hints, use
the elimination strategy.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.725
If unsure, eliminate options
that are clearly irrelevant.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.210
You can also try categorization.

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:53.685
Mentally grouping the phrase by
type people, places, actions,

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.205
studies to narrow down choices.

00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:01.815
And a great trick is to practice
with themes, grouping words by common

00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.675
topics for easier memorization.

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:05.885
Methods of solving.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.235
Here are the step-by-step methods
for approaching these questions.

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:12.815
First, read the phrase carefully.

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:16.954
Begin by thoroughly reading
the given phrase or clause, and

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:18.755
understand its complete meaning.

00:04:19.084 --> 00:04:24.785
Second, identify keywords, pinpoint
the most important words or concepts

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.915
within the phrase that will guide you.

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:31.435
Third, brainstorm possible
words based on the key words.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:35.875
Try to recall any single words
that could replace the phrase even

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.495
before looking at the options.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:39.925
Fourth, analyze the options.

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:44.245
Now look at the given multiple
choice options and evaluate each

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:47.155
one fifth, check for an exact fit.

00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:50.815
Determine which option most
accurately expresses the

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.405
entire meaning of the phrase.

00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:53.215
Sixth.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.400
Consider nuances.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.760
Pay attention to the subtle differences
in meaning between similar sounding words.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
The correct answer will
be the most precise fit.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.360
And finally, verify with elimination.

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.830
If you are still unsure, eliminate
the options that are definitely wrong.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.030
Shortcuts and smart techniques
for some smart shortcuts.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.505
Focus on the core idea.

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:20.295
Quickly grasp the central theme
of the phrase, rather than

00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:22.215
getting lost in minor details.

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:27.255
Use negative elimination if you can't
find the right answer immediately,

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:29.865
quickly rule out the irrelevant options.

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:35.115
Do a prefix or suffix scan if the
phrase describes a person or an

00:05:35.115 --> 00:05:40.340
action quickly scan options for
common endings like ISD or DION.

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:46.284
When practicing, try thematic grouping to
recall other words from the same theme.

00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:52.284
A mental pronunciation check can also help
sometimes seeing the options can connect

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:58.164
them to familiar words and finally,
prioritize common categories in exams.

00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:03.205
Certain categories like fear study
or killing appear more frequently,

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:07.849
so prioritize learning these
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:10.975
Let's talk about common mistakes.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:15.355
A big one is choosing a
synonym, not a substitute.

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:20.515
This is picking a word that is a
synonym for just one word in the phrase

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:22.975
rather than a word for the whole thing.

00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:28.585
The correction is to ensure the chosen
word encapsulates the full meaning.

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:31.585
Another is ignoring context.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:36.445
Selecting a word that might be
correct in isolation, but doesn't fit.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.719
The specific scenario correction,
read the phrase carefully.

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:47.229
Also overlooking nuances, confusing
words with similar meanings, but distinct

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:53.020
connotations to fix this, develop a strong
sense of the precise meaning of words.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.750
Avoid guessing without elimination.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.730
Always try to eliminate at least
one or two incorrect options first,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.380
and please avoid just memorizing
lists without understanding.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.225
Focus on understanding word formation
and context for better retention.

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:12.945
WH framework summary.

00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:18.885
So to summarize this whole topic,
what is it, a single word replacing a

00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:21.495
phrase to convey its meaning concisely.

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:26.655
Why do we use it to enhance clarity
and impact in communication?

00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:32.025
When is it applied in situations
requiring brevity and precision?

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:36.405
Where is it used in formal
writing, competitive exams,

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:38.295
and professional communication?

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:42.515
Who benefits any friend,
writer, or professional?

00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:44.165
And how is it done?

00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:48.725
By understanding the phrase and
finding the most accurate single word

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:51.785
equivalent, fully worked out examples.

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.095
Example, one question.

00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:59.465
A person who believes that war and
violence are unjustifiable options.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:04.805
A pacifist B, militant
C, nationalist D, rebel.

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:10.715
Understand the question before moving
to explanation First, understand the

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:15.305
core, meaning the phrase describes
someone against war and violence.

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:18.215
The key idea is opposition to conflict.

00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.735
Second, evaluate the options.

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:25.745
A pacifist, a person who
believes war is unjustifiable.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:32.050
This is a. Perfect match, be militant,
someone combative, which is the opposite.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.770
C, nationalist, someone
advocating political

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.960
independence, which is unrelated.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.780
D Rebel, someone who resists a
government, not specifically all violence.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.030
So the best fit is pacifist.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.040
The most accurate substitute.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.710
The answer is a pacifist.

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:53.515
Example two question.

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:59.275
A place where coins, metals,
or tokens are made options.

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:07.915
A mint, B foundry, C Factory, D
workshop understand the question

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.805
before moving to explanation.

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:16.260
First, understand the core, meaning
The phrase refers to a place where

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.360
metallic currency is produced.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.560
The key is creating
coins, metals, or tokens.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.350
Second, evaluate the options.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.370
A mint, a place where
coins are manufactured.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.350
This aligns perfectly.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.455
B Foundry for general metal
casting, not specifically coins.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.060
C Factory, this is too general.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.770
D Workshop.

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:43.300
Also too general.

00:09:43.569 --> 00:09:46.180
Therefore, the best fit is Mint.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.180
The precise term for a place where
coins are made, the answer is a mint.

00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:55.455
Example three question.

00:09:55.665 --> 00:10:00.105
The study of the origin and
history of words, options.

00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:07.215
A, philology, B, etymology
C, lexicography, D Semantics.

00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:10.439
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:13.935
First, understand the meaning.

00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:18.615
The phrase describes a discipline
focused on the background of words.

00:10:18.944 --> 00:10:22.485
The key elements are origin
and history of words.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:25.125
Second, evaluate the options.

00:10:25.485 --> 00:10:30.074
A philology, the study of
literary texts, which is broader.

00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:36.295
B, etymology the study of the origin of
words and how their meanings have changed.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.245
This precisely matches.

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:42.595
C lexicography the practice
of writing dictionaries.

00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:48.535
D semantics, the branch of linguistics,
concerned with meaning not history.

00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:51.475
So the best fit is etymology.

00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:54.385
It is the exact one word substitute.

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:57.265
The answer is B etymology.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:58.194
Thank you.

00:10:58.345 --> 00:10:59.995
See you in the next lecture.
