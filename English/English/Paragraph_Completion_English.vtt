Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on paragraph completion.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.125
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.255
Paragraph completion is a crucial
section in the English language paper

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.195
of competitive exams like your exam.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:27.225
This section assesses a friend's ability
to understand the context coherence

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.924
and logical flow of a given paragraph.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.860
The task typically involves filling in
a blank or blanks within a paragraph

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.500
with the most appropriate sentence or
phrase From a given set of options, the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.480
chosen option must seamlessly integrate
with the proceeding and succeeding

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.330
sentences, maintaining the overall theme.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.040
And dawn of the paragraph.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.775
To excel in paragraph completion.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:59.535
A strong grasp of vocabulary, grammar,
and logical reasoning is essential.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:03.824
Friends need to identify the
central idea of the paragraph,

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:08.295
understand the relationships
between sentences, and recognize

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:11.175
any shifts in topic or perspective.

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.735
It's not just about finding a
grammatically correct sentence, but

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:20.685
one that makes the paragraph complete
and meaningful in its entirety.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:22.815
Real world relevance.

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:26.384
Clear and concise
communication is paramount.

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:31.485
Paragraph completion skills enhance
one's ability to quickly grasp the

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:36.884
essence of complex documents, such as
financial reports, legal agreements,

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.835
and customer correspondence.

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:43.725
This ensures accurate interpretation
and effective decision making,

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.774
directly impacting client relations
and operational efficiency.

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:50.714
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.074
Analyzing past exam
patterns for your exam's.

00:01:54.074 --> 00:01:58.185
English section, particularly
for paragraph completion, reveals

00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.835
recurring question formats.

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:04.395
While exact percentages can
fluctuate year to year, the general

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:06.044
trends indicate the following.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.859
Sentence insertion replacement, 40 to 50%.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.079
This is the most common type where a
blank is provided, and friends must choose

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.690
the sentence that best fits the context.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.030
Sometimes an existing sentence needs to
be replaced with a more suitable one.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.610
Paragraph completion with
theme tone, 25 to 35%.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.280
These questions require understanding
the overall theme tone or argument

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.440
of the paragraph to select an option
that maintains consistency, logical

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.250
connectors or transitions, 15 to 20%
questions focusing on words or phrases

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.780
that establish logical connections
between sentences such as, however.

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:58.054
Therefore, in addition, et cetera,
concluding sentence five to 10%,

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:02.255
identifying the most appropriate
sentence to conclude a given

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:07.204
paragraph, summarizing the main
idea or providing a logical wrap up.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:09.424
Formulas plus tricks.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:14.285
While there are no mathematical formulas
in English, here are some tricks or

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.625
strategies for paragraph completion.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:18.155
Concept clues.

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:22.505
Always read the sentences before
and after the blank carefully.

00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:28.989
They provide vital clues about the missing
information keywords, identify keywords

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:34.565
or phrases that indicate the topic tone
or logical direction of the paragraph.

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:36.685
Cohesion and coherence.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:40.825
The chosen sentence must
create a smooth flow of ideas.

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:44.875
Look for pronouns, conjunctions,
and repeated words that

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.395
link sentences, elimination.

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:52.255
Rule out options that are grammatically
incorrect, irrelevant to the topic,

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.445
or disrupt the paragraphs flow.

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:58.875
Theme and tone ensure the
selected sentence aligns with

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:00.795
the overall theme and tone.

00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:07.065
Eeg, formal, informal, argumentative,
descriptive practice, consistent

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:11.295
practice with various types of paragraph
completion questions is the most

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.424
effective formula for improvement.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:15.355
Methods of solving.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:18.865
Here are step-by-step methods
for approaching paragraph

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:20.125
completion questions.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:22.345
Read the entire paragraph.

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:26.305
Begin by reading the complete
paragraph, including the blank,

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:31.165
to grasp the overall context, main
idea, and flow of information.

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.715
Do not jump directly to the options.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.920
Identify the central theme.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.550
Determine the core subject
or argument of the paragraph.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.960
This will help you eliminate options
that deviate from the main topic.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.610
Analyze sentences around the
blank, pay close attention to the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.060
sentences, immediately proceeding
and succeeding the blank.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.090
Look for logical connections, transitional
words, pronouns, and repeated ideas that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.430
provide clues about the missing sentence.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.110
Predict the missing content,
optional but recommended.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.420
Before looking at the options, try to
anticipate what kind of information or

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.060
idea would logically fit into the blank.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.670
This helps in pre-filtering options.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.460
Evaluate each option, read each given
option Carefully consider how each

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.200
option would fit into the blank.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.530
Checking for logical coherence,
grammatical correctness.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.260
Themic consistency, flow and transition.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.480
Eliminate unsuitable options.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.590
Discard options that are
irrelevant, grammatically incorrect.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.240
Introduce new, unrelated ideas or
disrupt the flow of the paragraph.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.890
Select the best fit.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.060
Choose the option that most
logically and coherently completes

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.780
the paragraph, maintaining its
original meaning and structure.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.520
Reread the completed paragraph
after inserting your chosen option.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.170
Read the entire paragraph.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.310
Again to ensure it reads smoothly
and makes complete sense.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.220
Shortcuts and smart techniques to save
time and improve accuracy during the exam.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.100
Consider these shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.800
Look for pronoun and decedent agreement.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.330
If the blank is followed by a pronoun,
he, she, it, they, this, that, these,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.890
those, the preceding sentence or the
one you are inserting must contain

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.960
the noun or idea to which the pronoun
refers, identify, cause and effect.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.490
Look for words like, because
since, as a result, therefore.

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:36.395
Consequently, these indicate a
cause and effect relationship,

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:40.145
and the missing sentence should
either be the cause or the effect.

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:47.105
Recognize, contrast and comparison words
like however, but although in contrast

00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:52.565
similarly, likewise signal a contrast
or comparison, the missing sentence

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.425
should align with this relationship.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.550
Spot chronological order.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.469
If the paragraph describes events in a
sequence, ensure the inserted sentence

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.539
maintains the chronological flow.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.539
Look for time markers, eg first.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.419
Then after finally parallelism,
sometimes sentences in a paragraph.

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.960
Follow a. Parallel structure.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.410
The missing sentence might
need to complete this pattern.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.140
Topic sentence, concluding sentence clues.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.010
If the blank is at the beginning,
it's likely a topic sentence.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.630
Introducing the main idea.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.460
If at the end it's probably a concluding
sentence, summarizing the paragraph,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.290
grammar and syntax check a quick scan
for grammatical errors or awkward

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.250
phrasing in the options can help
eliminate incorrect choices quickly.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.600
Don't overthink.

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:44.385
Trust your initial gut feeling
if the option logically fits

00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:45.765
and maintains coherence.

00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:48.795
Avoid spending too much
time on a single question.

00:07:49.245 --> 00:07:51.555
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:53.775
Ignoring context.

00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:59.835
Many friends focus solely on the blank
and fail to read the entire paragraph,

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:05.594
leading to choices that are grammatically
correct, but contextually irrelevant.

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:11.835
Grammatical fit, only selecting an
option just because it is grammatically

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:16.935
correct without considering its logical
and thematic fit within the paragraph.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.560
Introducing new ideas.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.620
Choosing an option that introduces a
completely new idea or shifts the topic

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.110
abruptly, disrupting the paragraph's.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.770
Unity.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.720
Misinterpreting tone.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.870
Failing to recognize the
tone of the paragraph.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:39.809
Example, sarcastic, formal, informal,
and selecting an option that clashes

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:45.480
with it, overlooking transitional words,
not paying attention to conjunctions.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:51.245
Adverbs and other transitional words that
signal relationships between sentences,

00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:57.785
rushing reading too quickly and missing
subtle clues or logical inconsistencies.

00:08:58.235 --> 00:09:04.325
Fixating on one option, spending too much
time trying to make one option fit instead

00:09:04.325 --> 00:09:07.145
of objectively evaluating all choices.

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.605
WH framework summary.

00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:16.275
What paragraph completion assesses
the ability to logically complete a

00:09:16.275 --> 00:09:22.065
given paragraph by choosing the most
appropriate sentence or phrase why it

00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:27.285
is important for evaluating a friend's
comprehension logical reasoning and

00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:29.205
command over the English language.

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:32.775
Crucial for effective communication
in professional settings.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:32.895
When.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.229
Applied in competitive exams
like your exam to test language

00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:43.300
proficiency and analytical skills
were primarily found in the English

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.160
language section of banking and other
government competitive examinations.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.540
Who friends?

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.469
Aspiring for government and
banking jobs and anyone looking to

00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:57.520
improve their English comprehension
and logical reasoning skills.

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:58.150
How?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.610
By understanding context, identifying
logical connections, analyzing sentence.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.780
Structure and maintaining thematic
consistency within a paragraph.

00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:10.900
Fully worked out Examples.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.830
Example, one question.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.860
Many scientists believe that the universe
is expanding at an accelerating rate.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.530
This expansion is driven by a
mysterious force called dark energy.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.760
While dark energy constitutes about 68%
of the universe's total energy density,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.880
its nature remains largely unknown.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:36.685
Dash.

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:43.194
This makes it one of the most significant
puzzles in modern cosmology options.

00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:49.074
A therefore, understanding dark
energy is crucial for comprehending

00:10:49.194 --> 00:10:51.324
the ultimate fate of the universe.

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:56.665
B, scientists are conducting
experiments to detect dark matter,

00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.760
which is different from dark energy.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:05.720
C, the universe's expansion was initially
thought to be slowing down due to gravity.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:11.330
D. Dark energy is a hypothetical
form of energy that exerts a

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.310
negative repulsive pressure.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.110
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.080
Step one, understand the context.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.880
The paragraph discusses the.

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:28.655
Accelerating expansion of the universe
driven by dark energy and highlights

00:11:28.805 --> 00:11:31.295
that its nature is largely unknown.

00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:35.944
The blank is at the end of the
paragraph suggesting a concluding

00:11:35.944 --> 00:11:39.574
statement that logically follows
the proceeding information.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:45.575
Step two, analyze the sentences around
the blank, the sentence before the blank.

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:46.115
States.

00:11:46.295 --> 00:11:52.895
While dark energy constitutes about 68%
of the universe's total energy density,

00:11:53.105 --> 00:11:55.865
its nature remains largely unknown.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:00.725
The sentence after the blank says,
this makes it one of the most

00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:03.635
significant puzzles in modern cosmology.

00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:06.505
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:12.204
A therefore, understanding dark
energy is crucial for comprehending

00:12:12.204 --> 00:12:14.185
the ultimate fate of the universe.

00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:19.435
This option logically connects the
unknown nature of dark energy to

00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:24.084
its importance in understanding the
universe's fate, which aligns with the

00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:26.994
idea of it being a significant puzzle.

00:12:27.325 --> 00:12:32.215
B. Scientists are conducting
experiments to detect dark matter,

00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:34.435
which is different from dark energy.

00:12:34.765 --> 00:12:40.825
This option introduces a new concept, dark
matter, and deviates from the main topic

00:12:40.945 --> 00:12:43.525
of dark energy and its unknown nature.

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:49.645
C, the universe's expansion was initially
thought to be slowing down due to gravity.

00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:54.505
While true, this statement provides
historical context about the

00:12:54.505 --> 00:12:59.064
universe's expansion and doesn't
directly follow the discussion about

00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:01.104
the unknown nature of dark energy.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:06.474
D. Dark energy is a hypothetical
form of energy that exerts a

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:08.365
negative repulsive pressure.

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:13.344
This option defines dark energy,
but the preceding sentence already

00:13:13.344 --> 00:13:15.324
established its mysterious nature.

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:19.925
The blank requires a consequence
or implication of its unknown

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:21.844
nature, not a definition.

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:27.995
Step four, select the best fit option
A provides a logical conclusion that

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:32.525
directly follows from the mysterious
and unknown nature of dark energy,

00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:37.415
linking it to its significance in
cosmology, it seamlessly connects

00:13:37.474 --> 00:13:42.245
with the idea of dark energy being
a significant puzzle, correct?

00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:45.395
Answer a example two question.

00:13:45.795 --> 00:13:50.955

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.845
make predictions with remarkable accuracy.

00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:07.425
This capability has led to significant
advancements such as improved

00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:12.195
diagnostic tools in medicine, and more
efficient fraud detection in banking.

00:14:13.145 --> 00:14:18.485
However, ethical considerations and
potential job displacement remain key

00:14:18.485 --> 00:14:20.675
challenges that need to be addressed.

00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:25.925
Options A, the development of
AI has been a continuous process

00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:27.329
since the mid 20th century.

00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:33.275
B. AI's ability to automate
repetitive tasks has also boosted

00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:35.345
productivity across sectors.

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:41.075
C. Many fear that AI will eventually
surpass human intelligence leading

00:14:41.075 --> 00:14:42.935
to unforeseen consequences.

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:48.725
D governments worldwide are investing
heavily in AI research and development.

00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:52.265
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:53.239
Solution.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.910
Step one, understand the context.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.709
The paragraph discusses the positive
impacts of AI across various

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:04.880
industries, highlighting its
analytical and predictive capabilities.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:09.589
The blank is followed by a sentence
that introduces challenges associated

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:13.670
with ai, suggesting that the
missing sentence should continue the

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.589
positive aspects before the shift.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.580
Step two, analyze the sentences
around the blank, the sentence

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.990
before the blank states.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:27.210

advancements such as improved

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.860
diagnostic tools in medicine, and more
efficient fraud detection in banking.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.010
The sentence after the
blank says, however.

00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:39.605
Ethical considerations and potential
job displacement remain key

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.765
challenges that need to be addressed.

00:15:41.945 --> 00:15:44.375
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:48.575
A. The development of AI has
been a continuous process

00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:50.435
since the mid 20th century.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:54.635
This is a historical fact about
AI development and doesn't

00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:56.285
fit the flow of discussing.

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.325
AI's aren't positive impacts.

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:03.555
B. AI's ability to automate
repetitive tasks has also boosted

00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:05.594
productivity across sectors.

00:16:05.954 --> 00:16:10.844
This option continues the discussion of
AI's positive contributions, boosting

00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:16.185
productivity, and logically proceeds the
introduction of challenges with however.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:21.855
C, many fear that AI will eventually
surpass human intelligence leading

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.685
to unforeseen consequences.

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:29.445
This option introduces a negative aspect,
but the transition word, however, after

00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:33.885
the blank, indicates that the blank
itself should be a positive aspect,

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.805
contrasting with the challenges.

00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:40.564
D. Governments worldwide are
investing heavily in AI research

00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:43.055
and development while related to ai.

00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:47.135
This statement about government
investment doesn't directly follow

00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:51.454
the discussion of AI's capabilities
and advancements in industries.

00:16:51.685 --> 00:16:53.905
Step four, select the best fit.

00:16:54.175 --> 00:17:00.055
Option B seamlessly continues the positive
narrative about AI's impact specifically

00:17:00.204 --> 00:17:02.155
its role in boosting productivity.

00:17:02.484 --> 00:17:06.054
This creates a smooth transition
to the subsequent sentence,

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:09.895
which introduces the contrasting
challenges with the word however.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:13.714
Correct answer B example three question.

00:17:14.044 --> 00:17:17.885
Climate change is a pressing
global issue, primarily driven

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:22.474
by human activities that release
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

00:17:22.895 --> 00:17:27.905
These gases trap heat leading to a
gradual increase in global temperatures.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:33.060
The consequences are far reaching,
including rising sea levels, more

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.110
frequent extreme weather events
and disruptions to ecosystems.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.920
Dash.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.540
Addressing this crisis requires a
concerted effort from governments,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.090
industries, and individuals worldwide.

00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:46.075
Options.

00:17:46.285 --> 00:17:50.754
A historically earth's climate
has undergone natural cycles

00:17:50.754 --> 00:17:51.925
of warming and cooling.

00:17:52.165 --> 00:17:57.264
B, renewable energy sources like
solar and wind power offer viable

00:17:57.264 --> 00:17:59.004
alternatives to fossil fuels.

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:03.595
C, the impact of climate change
is not uniformly distributed

00:18:03.745 --> 00:18:07.435
with some regions experiencing
more severe effects than others.

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:11.335
D. International agreements
such as the Paris Agreement,

00:18:11.514 --> 00:18:12.775
aim to limit global warming.

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:17.530
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:20.139
Step one, understand the context.

00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:24.669
The paragraph discusses the causes
and consequences of climate change.

00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:29.020
The blank is positioned after a
list of consequences and before

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.469
a sentence that talks about the
need for a concerted effort.

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:36.040
Step two, analyze the
sentences around the blank.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:40.595
The sentence before the blank states,
the consequences are far reaching,

00:18:40.805 --> 00:18:45.125
including rising sea levels, more
frequent extreme weather events

00:18:45.275 --> 00:18:47.315
and disruptions to ecosystems.

00:18:47.675 --> 00:18:52.085
The sentence after the blank says,
addressing this crisis requires a

00:18:52.085 --> 00:18:55.805
concerted effort from governments,
industries, and individuals worldwide.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.165
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:18:59.435 --> 00:19:03.814
A historically earth's climate
has undergone natural cycles

00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:04.955
of warming and cooling.

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:09.784
This statement is true, but shifts the
focus to historical climate patterns

00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:14.165
deviating from the current human
induced crisis and its consequences.

00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:19.149
B, renewable energy sources like
solar and wind power offer viable

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.750
alternatives to fossil fuels.

00:19:21.449 --> 00:19:25.830
This option introduces a solution,
but the paragraph is still detailing

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.419
the problem and its impacts.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.020
The sentence after the blank
is about addressing the crisis.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.270
So this option would be premature.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.800
C. The impact of climate change
is not uniformly distributed

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:41.340
with some regions experiencing
more severe effects than others.

00:19:41.845 --> 00:19:46.045
This option continues to elaborate on
the consequences of climate change,

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:50.455
providing another important detail
about its varied impact it logically

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.735
fits before the call for global effort.

00:19:53.004 --> 00:19:56.605
D. International agreements
such as the Paris Agreement,

00:19:56.784 --> 00:19:58.254
aim to limit global warming.

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:03.929
This option, like B discusses solutions
or actions which comes after the blank.

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:07.350
The blank should further describe
the problem or its effects.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.689
Step four, select the best fit.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.240
Option C provides an additional relevant
consequence of climate change emphasizing

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.580
the uneven distribution of its impact.

00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:21.929
This logically extends the discussion
of the problem before the paragraph

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.620
transitions to the need for global
action to address the crisis.

00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:28.129
Correct answer c. Thank you.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.689
See you in the next lecture.
