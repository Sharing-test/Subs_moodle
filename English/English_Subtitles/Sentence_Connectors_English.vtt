Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on sentence connectors.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.790
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.150
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.080
Explanation.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
All right, so what exactly
are these sentence connectors?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
Think of them like the railway
tracks that connect different

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.490
compartments of a train or.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.780
Perfect chai that brings people together,
their words or phrases, my friend, that

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.500
elegantly link ideas, sentences, or even
entire paragraphs, their job to create

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.960
a smooth, logical flow of information.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.950
Without them, your writing
would be like a broken signal.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.700
Totally incoherent.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
They help establish relationships between
different parts of a text, making it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.650
coherent and super easy to understand.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.860
Imagine trying to talk without any
and but or so quite a task, isn't it?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.140
They act as bridges, connecting separate
thoughts, guiding the reader through

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.150
your intended meaning, much like a good
GPS guides you through city traffic.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.340
They can indicate addition.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:15.395
Contrast cause and effect
sequence and a whole lot more.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.765
Mastering sentence connectors, my
friends, is absolutely crucial for both

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:25.955
comprehending complex texts and of course
for effective communication in English.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:31.805
It's like learning the secret handshake
of good writing, real world relevance.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.250
Now, why should you, my brilliant
friend, bother with these connectors,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.610
especially when you are aiming
for those high flying careers?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.390
Well, clear communication
isn't just important.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.620
It's paramount, like having your
balance sheet tally up perfectly

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.750
sentence connectors, ensure your
reports, your emails, and especially

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.040
those crucial customer interactions
are coherent, professional, and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.600
reflect the precision that's absolutely
vital for any financial role.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.449
Imagine explaining a L terms
without clear connections.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.820
It would be chaos, pure, and simple.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.560
So let's talk about the specific
areas where these linguistic

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.269
superheroes come in handy.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.549
First up, report writing.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280
This is where you structure financial
reports logically, ensuring every number

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.410
tells a story, and every paragraph builds
on the previous one, not just jumping

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.299
around like a kangaroo on caffeine.

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:34.615
Next customer communication,
explaining complex financial products.

00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.165
You can't just throw terms at a customer.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:40.765
You need to connect the dots for
them, making it sound simple,

00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:44.905
even if the underlying product
is as complicated as a multi led

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.845
biani, then we have internal memos.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.600
Ensuring directives are
understood without ambiguity.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Nobody wants a memo that
sounds like it was written in

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.580
a hurry on a Tuesday morning.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.340
And of course, policy interpretation
connecting various clauses and conditions.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.830
Legal documents are already tricky.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.740
Your understanding shouldn't
add to the confusion.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.800
Don't forget loan applications, detailing
terms and conditions precisely here.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.260
Every and, and but matters sometimes
literally saving or costing money.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.420
Finally, presentation skills, delivering
coherent and persuasive pitches.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.019
Whether you are pitching a new
product or an idea, you need

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.790
your points to flow seamlessly.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.089
Keeping your audience hooked
like a good Bollywood movie.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.750
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.320
All right, let's get
down to the brass tacks.

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:44.390
How do these mischievous little
connectors appear in your English exam?

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:50.549
Primarily, they test your ability to
logically combine sentences using the

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.984
appropriate connecting words or phrases.

00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:58.975
Based on past exam patterns, which
by the way are more predictable

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:00.625
than a typical Indian wedding.

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:06.085
The reoccurring question formats
include first, and this is the

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:10.915
big one, combining two sentences
appro, 50 to 60% of questions.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.660
This is the most common type where you
are given two sentences, innocent and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.120
separate, and then a set of connectors.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.640
Your task to choose the connector that
correctly combines these two sentences

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.860
into a single grammatically sound
and logically coherent masterpiece.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.245
It's like matchmaking for sentences.

00:04:34.265 --> 00:04:40.895
Then we have sentence starters or
fillers, appro 20 to 30% in this format.

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:45.515
A sentence or two are provided, and
you need to select the appropriate

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:49.925
connector from the options to
either start the sentence or fill

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:51.255
in a blank somewhere in the middle.

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:56.075
The goal here is to ensure the
overall meaning and flow are

00:04:56.075 --> 00:05:00.515
maintained, like ensuring your
sari pleats are perfectly aligned.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:03.935
Next up, identifying incorrect usage.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.035
Appro 10 to 15%.

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:09.695
These questions are a bit
like being a detective.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:12.365
They present sentences where connect.

00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:17.485
Does are already used and you,
my friend, need to identify if

00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:21.685
the connector is used correctly
or if it's creating a grammatical

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:24.265
error or logical inconsistency.

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:29.755
Sometimes they're just trying to
trick you, so be sharp and while less

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:34.675
frequent, sometimes you might encounter
paragraph completion or coherence.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.565
Appro five to 10%.

00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:41.354
Here, you might need to choose a
connector to complete a paragraph

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:45.945
or to improve the coherence between
sentences within a larger text.

00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:50.534
It's about making the whole
story flow, not just individual

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.385
sentences, formulas and tricks.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.510
Now before you ask for a debunk formula
for sentence connectors, let me clarify.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.090
There are no mathematical formulas here.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.539
This isn't calculus my friend, but there
are key principles and tricks like secret.

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.460
They see hacks to master them.

00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:15.385
The first and most important is
to understand the relationship.

00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:20.395
Before you even think about choosing
a connector, you need to identify

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:24.474
the logical relationship between
the two clauses or sentences.

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:29.155
Are they showing cause and effect, like
eating too much burani and then needing

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:35.515
a nap, or is it contrast addition
sequence or something else Entirely get.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.340
This right, and half your battle is one.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.760
Then remember, context is king.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.020
Always read the sentences in
their entirety and understand

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.400
the overall context.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.260
A connector that might seem
appropriate in isolation might not

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.880
fit the broader meaning at all.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.500
It's like wearing a tuxedo to a beach
party looks good on its own, but.

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:00.235
Totally out of place.

00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:02.215
Don't forget the grammar check.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:05.455
Ensure the chosen connector
fits grammatically.

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:10.255
Some connectors, like although are
followed by a full clause, while

00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:14.455
others like despite are followed
by a noun phrase or a gernt.

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:19.975
It's a small detail, but crucial like
adding the correct spices to your curry.

00:07:20.515 --> 00:07:22.525
Use the elimination strategy.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.070
If you are unsure, eliminate options
that clearly don't fit the meaning

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.200
or are grammatically incorrect.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.880
This simple trick dramatically
increases your chances of selecting

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.410
the right answer, much like weeding
out the bad apples from a fruit basket.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.940
And finally.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.860
Common connector categories.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.840
Familiarize yourself with these.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.000
It's like knowing your family tree.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.210
You know who's related to whom for
addition, think, and also moreover.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.930
Furthermore, in addition,
besides they're all saying,

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.970
Hey, there's more to this story.

00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:04.615
For contrast we have, but however,
although though, even though despite

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:09.294
in spite of, nevertheless, on the
other hand, these are your, but

00:08:09.294 --> 00:08:11.034
wait, there's more to this side.

00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:16.914
Connectors for cause and effect
use because since, as therefore,

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:18.955
consequently as a result.

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:24.265
So these show why something happened or
what happened because of something else.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.260
For sequence simple ones like first, next.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:34.230
Then after that, finally they tell
a story step by step for condition.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:40.289
If unless provided that as long as
these are your, if this, then that

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:46.050
kind of connectors and for purpose
two, in order to, so that they tell

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.060
you why something is being done.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.980
Methods of solving.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.705
All right, my friends.

00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:57.495
Let's talk about the modus operandi,
the step-by-step process for tackling

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.355
these sentence connector questions.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:05.085
It's not rocket science, but it does
require a bit of discipline, like

00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:07.545
following a recipe for your favorite dish.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:09.195
First things first.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.560
Read both sentences carefully.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.730
Don't be in a hurry, like catching
a local train during peak hours.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.260
Understand the individual meaning
of each sentence before you

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.120
even attempt to connect them.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.110
Pay attention to keywords,
subjects, and verbs.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.080
What are they trying
to tell you separately?

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.080
Next, identify the relationship.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.790
This is the core.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.140
Ask yourself is the second
sentence, adding more information.

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:43.775
Contrasting with the first showing
a cause, indicating an effect,

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.234
or perhaps providing a sequence.

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:50.854
It's like figuring out if your
friend is agreeing with you, arguing

00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:53.104
with you, or just narrating events.

00:09:53.464 --> 00:09:55.415
Then analyze the options.

00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:58.354
Look at the given sentence
connectors in the options.

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:03.725
Consider what kind of relationship
each connector typically expresses.

00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:09.125
If an option says however you
immediately think, contrast, if it

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:11.435
says, therefore you think, result.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:17.435
Now for a bit of trial and error,
mental application, mentally insert

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:21.665
each option into the blank or
use it to combine the sentences.

00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:26.175
Read the combined sentence aloud,
if possible, without annoying

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:29.685
your neighbors to check for flow
and grammatical correctness.

00:10:30.075 --> 00:10:32.025
Does it sound right to your ear?

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:37.125
Crucially, check for grammatical
consistency ensure that the chosen

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:40.995
connector fits the grammatical
structure of the combined sentence.

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:46.185
For instance, some connectors require a
comma before them, while others do not.

00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:48.555
Some are followed by a full clause.

00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:50.150
Others by just a phrase.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.170
It's like making sure your
KTA is tucked in correctly.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.090
The most vital step.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.310
Verify logical coherence.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.910
The combined sentence
must make logical sense.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.390
The connector should accurately
reflect the relationship

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.490
you identified in step two.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.420
If it doesn't, then you've got
a beautiful sounding sentence

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.760
that means absolutely nothing.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.030
Don't be afraid to eliminate distractors.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.340
Rule out options that create an illogical
meaning are grammatically incorrect,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.770
or simply do not fit the context.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.810
Sometimes finding the wrong answers
is faster than finding the right one.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.600
And finally, focus on nuance.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.950
Some connectors might seem similar,
like however, and nevertheless, but they

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.320
can have subtle differences in nuance.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.300
Choose the one that best captures the
precise relationship you are aiming for.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.230
It's about finding the perfect
word, not just a good one.

00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:51.724
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:11:52.115 --> 00:11:55.625
Okay, my friends, for those of
you who appreciate smart work

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.495
over just hard work, here are some
shortcuts and clever techniques.

00:11:59.915 --> 00:12:03.214
Think of them as your secret
mantra for these questions.

00:12:03.574 --> 00:12:04.775
First keyword matching.

00:12:05.655 --> 00:12:09.645
Look for keywords in both sentences
that hint at a relationship.

00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:14.325
For instance, if one sentence talks
about a problem and the next talks

00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:18.555
about a solution, you are looking for
a cause and effect or result connector.

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:22.815
If there's a negative vibe in one
and a positive counter in the other,

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:27.195
think contrast, this can quickly
narrow down your connector options.

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:31.305
Saving your precious time like
knowing a shortcut through traffic.

00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:33.555
Next punctuation clues.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.189
Pay attention to punctuation around
the blank or between sentences.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.500
A semicolon often precedes a conjunctive
adverb, like however, therefore,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.939
moreover, while a comma might
proceed, a coordinating conjunction

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.860
like and but or punctuation is
like the signboards on the road.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.320
They tell you what kind of turn to expect.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.930
Then sentence structure awareness.

00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:02.564
Some connectors demand specific
grammatical structures, for instance,

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:07.695
despite and in spite of are followed
by a noun or a gerand, the ING

00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:12.345
form of a verb used as a noun while
although, and even though are followed

00:13:12.345 --> 00:13:14.805
by a full clause subject plus verb.

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:19.005
Quickly identify if the structure
after the blank matches the

00:13:19.005 --> 00:13:20.235
connector's requirement.

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:24.105
This is like knowing the difference
between a car that needs petrol

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:25.485
and one that needs diesel.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.365
Consider the positive or negative flow.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:32.325
Determine if the two sentences have
a positive, positive relationship,

00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:36.165
a negative, negative relationship,
or a positive negative one.

00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:39.465
This helps immensely in
choosing connectors that

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:41.565
express agreement or contrast.

00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:45.620
For instance, if both sentences
are positive, in addition works.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.120
If one is positive and the other negative,
however, or although might be your go-to

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.250
practice with common pairs, regularly
practice questions involving commonly

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.020
confused connector pairs, like while
versus whereas or since versus form.

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:03.329
This builds intuition and speed.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.660
The more you practice, the
faster your brain processes.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.370
These distinctions, almost like second
nature, and if you are ever stuck

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.560
in a bind, try reverse engineering.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.790
If you are completely lost, try
to think of a connector that would

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.710
logically connect the two sentences.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.050
If there were no options given, then see
if that type of connector, for example,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.670
a contrast connector, a cause and effect
connector, is available in the choices.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.500
Sometimes working backward gives
you the forward solution, common

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.540
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.330
All right, my friends, it's time for the.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.570
Common pitfalls, the traps that can
snag even the smartest among you.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.760
Avoiding these mistakes is half
the battle won, like knowing which

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.140
gully to avoid during monsoon.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.959
First up, ignoring context.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.750
A classic blunder a common mistake is
choosing a connector based solely on

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.520
its general meaning without considering
the specific context and nuance

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.439
of the sentences being connected.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.760
Always read the entire
passage or both sentences.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.880
Don't just pick a connector
because it sounds good.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.040
It must fit the story.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.370
Next, confusing similar connectors.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.930
Many connectors have similar
meanings but are not interchangeable.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.000
Think although versus despite,
or because versus due to.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.670
These are often used incorrectly.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.560
Understand the precise grammatical
rules and subtle differences for each.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.900
It's like confusing pan, which.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.360
Tofu similar, but definitely not the same.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.270
Then overlooking punctuation.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.940
This is a silent killer, my friends.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.150
Incorrect punctuation, like missing commas
or using a comma instead of a semicolon

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.700
can make an otherwise correct connector.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.050
Usage grammatically wrong.

00:15:59.945 --> 00:16:04.415
Pay meticulous attention to the
punctuation required by each connector.

00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:09.185
It's a small dot or a tiny
curve, but it changes everything.

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:12.725
A big one is assuming cause and effect.

00:16:13.085 --> 00:16:18.155
Not every sequence of events implies a
direct cause and effect relationship.

00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:22.925
Sometimes events simply happen
one after another without one

00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.335
directly causing the other.

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:26.545
For example, it rained.

00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:27.745
I went home.

00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:30.625
Doesn't mean the rain
caused you to go home.

00:16:30.775 --> 00:16:32.575
You might have planned to go anyway.

00:16:32.995 --> 00:16:37.645
Choose connectors carefully to reflect
the true relationship, not just

00:16:37.645 --> 00:16:39.835
what seems obvious at first glance.

00:16:40.285 --> 00:16:41.935
Beware of redundancy.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:46.435
Using two connectors that express
the same relationship can lead to

00:16:46.435 --> 00:16:48.595
redundancy and awkward phrasing.

00:16:48.895 --> 00:16:50.605
For example, never.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.290
Ever use, although, but together,
it's like saying hot Guam,

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.570
chai Guam already means hot.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.960
And finally, misinterpreting contrast.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.630
This happens when friends confuse direct
opposition with concession, however

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.970
indicates a direct contrast or a different
point, although, on the other hand,

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.100
introduces a concession, something that
might seem to contradict the main clause,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.170
but doesn't prevent it from happening.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.390
Although it was raining, I went
out, the rain didn't stop me.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.620
It was raining.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.870
However, I carried an umbrella.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:32.270
The umbrella is a contrast to the
Rains effect WH framework summary.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:38.270
Let's quickly summarize what we've learned
using our trustee WH framework, almost

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.490
like a quick revision before the exam.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.330
So what are sentence connectors?

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.580
They are simply words or phrases
that link ideas, sentences, or even

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.070
paragraphs, creating a smooth flow.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.110
And why do we use them to create
coherence, logical flow, and to

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.830
establish clear relationships
between different parts of a text.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.570
They make your writing easy to understand,
like a well explained cricket match.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.220
When are they applied?

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.230
Oh, pretty much everywhere.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.060
When you are combining sentences,
introducing new ideas, or just showing

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.040
how one thought connects to another,
where are they used in all forms of

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.080
written and spoken English, my friend.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.760
But they're especially important in
formal writing, like essays, reports,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.010
and of course your competitive exams.

00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:28.774
Who needs to master them?

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:33.605
Anyone aiming for clear and effective
communication, particularly you

00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:35.825
my competitive exam aspirants.

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:39.815
And how do you master them by
understanding their meaning, their

00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:44.165
grammatical function, and most
importantly, the logical relationship

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.935
they express between ideas.

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.750
It's all about connection.

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:50.764
My friend fully worked out examples.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.139
All right.

00:18:52.439 --> 00:18:56.639
Theory is good, but practice is
where the real magic happens.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.935
Let's walk through some examples
step by step, like a guided.

00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:04.905
Example, one question.

00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:08.415
The company faced severe financial losses.

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:13.274
They decided to lay off a significant
portion of their workforce.

00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:17.804
Which of the following connectors
can be used to combine the above

00:19:17.804 --> 00:19:24.645
two sentences into one options
A, although B, in addition, C.

00:19:24.855 --> 00:19:31.125
Consequently D, despite understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:32.820
Solution.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.139
Step one, understand the
relationship between the sentences.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.939
Sentence one tells us the
company faced financial losses.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.960
Sentence two says they
decided to lay off employees.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.260
Now think why would
they lay off employees?

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.389
It's a direct outcome, a result of
those financial losses, isn't it?

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.620
So we are looking for a connector
that expresses cause and effect.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.910
It's like you don't study,
consequently, you don't pass.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.180
Step two, analyze the given options.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.820
A, although this one says even though
this happened, something else happened,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.640
it expresses contrast or concession.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.020
Not a good fit here.

00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:23.949
B. In addition, this just adds more
information like saying, I had samosas,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.760
in addition, I had jy not showing cause.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.550
C, consequently, aha.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.030
This word screams result or consequence.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.669
Exactly what we need for cause and effect.

00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:42.699
D, despite, again, this is for
contrast or concession, like although.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.590
Step three, choose the best
fit based on our analysis.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.650
Consequently is the most
appropriate connector.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.420
It clearly indicates that the layoffs
were a direct consequence of the

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.180
financial losses combined sentence.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.120
The company faced severe financial losses.

00:21:01.435 --> 00:21:06.865
Consequently, they decided to lay off a
significant portion of their workforce.

00:21:07.195 --> 00:21:09.145
Example, two question.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:12.054
She studied diligently for the exam.

00:21:12.415 --> 00:21:14.965
She still found some
questions challenging.

00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:18.865
Which of the following connectors
can be used to combine the

00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:21.085
above two sentences into one?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.760
Options A, moreover B, however,
C, therefore D, because

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.440
understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.200
Step one, understand the relationship
between the sentences sentence one

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.445
tells us she studied very hard.

00:21:41.015 --> 00:21:44.795
Sentence two tells us that
despite studying hard, she

00:21:44.795 --> 00:21:46.565
still found things challenging.

00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:49.085
There's a clear contrast here, isn't it?

00:21:49.535 --> 00:21:54.665
It's like preparing for a sunny day, but
still getting drenched in a sudden shower.

00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:58.325
We need a connector that
expresses this contrast.

00:21:58.565 --> 00:22:01.295
Step two, analyze the given options.

00:22:01.565 --> 00:22:06.905
A. Moreover, this means in addition,
or furthermore, no contrast here.

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:07.895
B however.

00:22:08.764 --> 00:22:13.385
This is our go-to for contrast
indicating something unexpected or

00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:15.215
opposite to what was just stated.

00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:21.574
C. Therefore, this is for showing a result
or consequence, like consequently not

00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:25.415
fitting D because this indicates a cause.

00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:29.189
She found questions challenging
because she studied diligently.

00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:30.465
No way.

00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:36.375
Step three, choose the best fit,
however, is the most suitable connector.

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:40.605
It perfectly highlights the
contrast between her diligent study

00:22:40.815 --> 00:22:45.435
and the unexpected difficulty of
some questions combined sentence.

00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:50.025
She studied diligently for the
exam, however, she still found

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.585
some questions, challenging.

00:22:51.915 --> 00:22:53.835
Example three question.

00:22:54.255 --> 00:22:57.375
The government implemented
new economic policies.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.890
The inflation rate began
to decline steadily.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.020
Which of the following connectors can be
used to combine the above two sentences

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.560
into one options A, in contrast?

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.180
B as a result?

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:16.070
C. Furthermore, D, unless
understand the question before

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.530
moving to explanation solution.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.810
Step one, understand the
relationship between the sentences.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.090
Sentence one describes the government
putting new policies into action.

00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:31.360
Sentence two describes
inflation going down.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.610
Common sense tells us that decline
in inflation is an outcome, a direct

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.220
result of those new policies, right?

00:23:39.699 --> 00:23:43.419
We need a connector that shows
this cause and effect relationship,

00:23:43.629 --> 00:23:45.189
like pressing the doorbell.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.350
As a result, the bell rings.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.350
Step two, analyze the given options.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.100
A. In contrast, this is
for showing opposition or

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.140
difference, not applicable here.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.260
B. As a result, this is perfect.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:04.240
It expresses consequence or outcome,
