Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on jumble words.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
Where about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.230
with this tutorial concept explanation.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.710
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.350
Let's start with the basics, shall we?

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.460
So what are these jumbled words you ask?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.280
Well, they are also famously, or
perhaps infamously known as sentence

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.350
rearrangement or para jumbles.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.840
Basically, someone has taken perfectly
good sentences, thrown them into a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.165
blender, and now it's your job to
put them back in the right order.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.895
The mission should you choose
to accept it, is to arrange them

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:49.425
into a coherent and grammatically
correct paragraph or sentence.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:55.005
It's all about making sure there's a
logical flow and it actually makes sense.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:01:00.975
Think of it as a test of your grammar
vocabulary, and of course your detective,

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:06.075
like logical reasoning and comprehension
skills, real world relevance.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.440
Now you might be thinking,
why am I unscramble sentences?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.450
I have better things to do, but wait
in your professional role, clear

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.700
communication is everything, right?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.320
It's vital for drafting those
important reports and interacting

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.150
with clients without confusing them.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.680
Mastering jumble words sharpens
your ability to quickly grasp and

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.120
construct logical narratives from
messy, fragmented information.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.980
Trust me, this is a superpower
for effective daily operations

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.260
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.660
Let's look at the different flavors.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.045
These questions come in
based on past exam patterns.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.009
First up with about a 40% frequency
is sentence rearrangement, where

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.410
the first or last sentence is fixed.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.399
They give you a starting or ending
point, which is quite helpful.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.669
Yeah.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.470
Then we have para jumbles with
no fixed sentences, making up

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.259
about 35% of questions here.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.760
Everything is jumbled and you are
on your own to find the entire

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.769
sequence a bit more challenging.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.040
No.

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:19.975
Next at around 15% frequency is
sentence completion with jumbled parts.

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:24.655
This is where one single sentence
is broken into pieces and you

00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:26.275
have to put it back together.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.095
Finally, there's the odd one out type.

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:35.005
About 10% of the time you get a set of
sentences and one just doesn't belong to

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.555
the group, like a pineapple on a pizza.

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:40.465
For some people, you
have to find that misfit.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.695
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:48.215
Okay, now for the secret
sauce, the formulas and tricks.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:54.095
First, always try to identify
the opening sentence, look for a

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:58.895
sentence that introduces a topic
and can stand all by itself.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:04.115
Next, do the opposite and
identify the concluding sentence.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:07.745
This one will summarize
or give a final thought.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.075
Then you must look for connectors.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:13.295
These are your best friends.

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:18.185
Words like therefore,
however, but so then.

00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:21.815
They are the glue that
holds sentences together.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:28.115
Also, keep an eye on the pronoun
noun relationship if you see it or

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:33.425
they, you must find the noun they are
referring to, which usually comes first.

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:39.455
Don't forget to check for chronological
order using clues like dates or

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:42.095
words like first then and finally.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.130
And lastly, look for cause and effect,
where one sentence describes an action

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.470
and another describes the result.

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.115
Methods of solving.

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:59.295
So what's a good method to tackle
these first read all sentences.

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.925
Just read through everything
to get a feel for the topic.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.785
Don't try to solve it yet.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:05.805
Just absorb.

00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.615
Second, identify the theme or subject.

00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:12.265
Figure out what the main idea is.

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:16.255
Is it about technology
history, a complaining cat?

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:19.315
Third, look for mandatory pairs.

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:23.605
Find two sentences that
absolutely must go together.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:25.495
This is a game changer.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.490
It could be a question and its
answer or a cause and its effect.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.240
Once you have a pair, you
can eliminate options.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.960
Look at the choices given,
and get rid of the ones that

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.730
don't have your mandatory pair.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.675
After you think you have a sequence,
check for cohesion and co. Read

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:47.655
your final paragraph out loud.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:52.485
Does it flow like a beautiful river
or does it sound like a car crash?

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.215
Make sure there are no weird jumps.

00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:59.145
Finally, always verify
grammatical consistency.

00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:04.395
Ensure that tenses and subject web
agreements are all correct throughout.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.350
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to work smarter, not harder.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.430
Of course you do.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.410
Here are some shortcuts.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.750
Use the option based approach.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.050
Instead of building the
sequence from scratch, just

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.790
look at the options provided.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.970
It's much faster to test
the given sequences.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.980
Also use the first and
last sentence strategy.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.500
If the first or last sentence is fixed,
use it as an anchor and build around it.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.170
Another trick is keyword matching.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.950
Look for repeated words
or ideas across sentences.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.885
They often signal a connection.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.155
Pay very close attention to transition.

00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:50.855
Word focus, those little words like,
but so also are powerful clues.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:55.325
If you are really stuck, use
trial and error with the options.

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:59.675
Just pick one option and see if
it makes a sensible paragraph.

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:03.965
And for the visual thinkers, the
flow chart method can be useful.

00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:07.410
Just create a mental map
of how the ideas connect.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.325
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:13.785
Now, let's talk about the traps.

00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:14.895
People fall into.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.405
A big one is ignoring grammatical links.

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:22.830
People get so focused on the meaning
that they forget about grammar.

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:25.075
Like pronoun references.

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:28.165
Another is jumping to conclusions.

00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:32.545
Just assuming a sequence is
correct without checking if

00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:34.705
all sentences fit Logically.

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:39.325
Also don't have over reliance
on the first or last sentence.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.980
Even if it's fixed, the middle part
still needs to make sense on its own.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.500
A classic mistake is not reading the
full paragraph After arranging it,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.110
you must read your final creation to
see if it's a masterpiece or a mess.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.050
And finally, be careful about confusing
general with specific statements.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.510
You should always introduce the general
idea before giving specific examples.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.260
W Edge Framework summary.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.020
So to wrap this up in a neat little
package, let's use the W Edge framework.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.000
What are we talking about?

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.310
Rearranging jumble sentences or parts
of them into something that makes sense.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.370
Why?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.539
Do we do this to test your
logical reasoning, comprehension,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.919
and language skills?

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.750
When is this applied?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.179
It's a common feature in competitive
exams to assess your language proficiency.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.979
Where will you find it?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.719
Primarily in the English language
section of other government exams.

00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:45.700
Who needs to master this?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.650
Any friend and job aspirant
appearing for such competitive exams.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:52.625
And how do we solve them?

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:57.965
By finding the logical connections,
grammatical links, and the overall flow

00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:00.755
between sentences fully worked out.

00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:01.594
Examples.

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.055
Example, one question.

00:08:04.445 --> 00:08:08.044
Arrange the following sentences
in a logical sequence to

00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:09.995
form a coherent paragraph A.

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:15.094
The government has introduced new
policies to boost the economy.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.710
B, these measures include tax cuts
and subsidies for small businesses.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.920
C. As a result, consumer spending
is expected to increase D. This

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.420
rise in demand will further
stimulate economic growth options.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:40.420
A, A, B, CD, BAC, B, D, C, B, A,
D, C, DA, D, C, B, understand the

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.340
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.810
Let's walk through this step by step.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.140
Step one, we need an opening sentence.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.010
Sentence.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.110
A introduces the main topic, new
policies, so it's a great start.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.720
Step two, now look for a link.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.579
Sentence B starts with these
measures, which directly refers

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:07.570
to the new policies from a. So
we have the pair ab, step three.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.420
Let's continue the story sentence C says,
as a result, showing up consequence.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.940
What is the consequence of tax cuts?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.380
Increased spending.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.840
So C follows B. A sequence
is now A, B, C. Step four.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.870
Time to conclude Sentence dimensions.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.240
This rise in demand, which points back to
the increase in consumer spending from c.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.385
This brings the whole
thing to a logical close.

00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:39.515
The final beautiful sequence
is A, B, C, D, correct option.

00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:44.074
A, A, B, C, D. Example, two question.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.425
Rearrange the following parts
to form a meaningful sentence.

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:54.855
A, to ensure that B, the
new system was implemented.

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:58.335
C, the team worked tirelessly.

00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:04.570
D, all objectives were
met Options A, C, B, A, D.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.260
B. CA, DB.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:15.840
CB, C-A-D-D-C-D-B-A understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.360
Let's break the sentence down.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.450
Step one, we need a subject.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.180
The team worked tirelessly from.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:31.290
C is a solid start, so the sentence
begins with C. Step two, we look for.

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:36.835
Purpose to ensure that from
a Connects perfectly, telling

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:38.635
us why they worked hard.

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:43.135
So we now have the pair ca, step three.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.475
Now what were they ensuring?

00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:51.460
They were ensuring the new system was
implemented and all objectives were met?

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.199
Following the provided logic, we
connect the parts to form a sequence.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.880
Step four, the final sentence
needs to flow correctly.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:09.230
The logical flow given is C, a, D, B as
per this, the sentence would read the.

00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:14.265
Steam worked tirelessly to ensure
that all objectives were met,

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:16.755
the new system was implemented.

00:11:17.145 --> 00:11:24.584
This is the sequence identified by the
logic provided correct option B-C-A-D-B.

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:27.314
Example, three question.

00:11:27.704 --> 00:11:31.155
Arrange the following
sentences in a logical order.

00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:36.525
A. However, the increasing population
poses a significant challenge.

00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:43.975
B India has made remarkable progress in
various sectors over the past few decades.

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:51.835
C, this puts immense pressure on resources
and D addressing this issue is crucial

00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:54.745
for sustainable development options.

00:11:55.045 --> 00:11:59.965
A, B, A C, DB, BD, CAC.

00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:07.375
A, B, C, D, D, C, BA, D understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:12:07.824 --> 00:12:09.775
Let's solve our final puzzle.

00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:16.255
Step one, we need an introduction
sentence B gives a broad, general

00:12:16.255 --> 00:12:20.635
statement about India's progress,
making it a perfect opening.

00:12:20.814 --> 00:12:24.385
Step two, now look for a twist sentence.

00:12:24.474 --> 00:12:27.234
A starts with, however, with signals.

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:32.105
Contrast to the good news in
B, it introduces a problem.

00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:34.025
So A must follow.

00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:37.265
B, we have BA step three.

00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:43.175
Let's explain this problem sentence
C starts with this referring to the.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.090
Increasing population
mentioned in A, it explains the

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.070
consequence of that challenge.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.070
So C follows A, our sequence
is now B, a c, step four.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:01.230
Let's find the conclusion sentence D.
Talks about addressing this issue, which

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.750
refers to the resource pressure from C.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.140
It gives a final thought
or a call to action.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.720
So D is our last sentence.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.060
The complete logical flow is
BACD, so the correct option

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.480
is A, B, a, c, D. Thank you.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.185
See you in the next lecture.
