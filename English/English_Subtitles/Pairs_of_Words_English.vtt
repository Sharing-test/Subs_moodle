00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on pairs of words.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.540
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.510
So what is this fuss all about?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
Pairs of words are basically
those mischievous word twins

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.509
that love to create confusion.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.520
Think of them as homophones that sound
the same homographs that are s spelled

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
the same, or just confus symbols with
meanings so close they could be neighbors.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.880
Getting them right is super important
because using the wrong one can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
flip your sentences, meaning upside
down, or just make it sound well.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:40.485
Wrong.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:45.345
Our focus today is to become masters
at spotting and using these words

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.535
correctly based on the situation.

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:49.905
Real world relevance.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.455
Now you might ask, why should I care?

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:53.685
Oh, you should.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:58.455
Understanding these word pairs is key
for sharp and professional communication.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:02.355
It ensures clarity in your
official reports, so you are always

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:03.974
conveying the right information.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.035
It leads to effective
correspondence, making your

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:08.940
emails and letters crystal clear.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.975
When you are giving professional
presentations, you'll speak with precision

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:15.555
and avoid any awkward misunderstandings.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.730
It's also vital for policy
interpretation, so you can correctly

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.220
explain rules in team collaboration.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.820
It makes sure everyone understands
instructions the same way.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.990
And finally, in public interaction,
it helps you communicate clearly

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.490
with all kinds of people.

00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:36.435
Breakdown of question types based
on what we've seen in the exam.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.075
Questions on this topic
come in a few flavors.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:43.725
About 40% of the time you'll face a fill
in the blanks question where you pick

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.585
the right word to complete a sentence.

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:51.015
Then with a 30% frequency comes sentence
correction or error identification,

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:56.140
where your job is to be a. The sentence
where a word has been used incorrectly.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.760
About 20% of questions will ask you
to choose an option where both words

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.690
from a pair are used correctly in
two separate sentences, and the final

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.220
10% is reserved for analogy questions
where you find a relationship between

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.669
one pair and match it with another.

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.485
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:14.295
All right.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:18.615
While there's no magic A plus B whole
squared formula here, we do have some

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:20.895
clever linguistic tricks and memory aids.

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:22.905
First is the part of speech rule.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:25.995
Many confused pairs are
different parts of speech.

00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:30.705
For instance, effect is usually a
verb while effect is typically a noun.

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:33.105
Just figure out what the sentence needs.

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:36.715
Next up mnemonics creates
silly little memory hooks.

00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:41.185
For example, a vice is a noun and
has ice in it, which is a thing.

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:41.815
A noun.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:44.545
Advice is a verb and has is in it.

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:45.715
Suggesting action.

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:49.525
Always use contextual clues
by reading the whole sentence.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:53.755
The surrounding words are your best
friends, and if you're really stuck, try

00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:56.965
substitution Test, swap in a synonym word.

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.760
The one that makes sense is winner.

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.185
Methods of solving.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.465
Here is your step-by-step battle plan.

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:07.125
First, read the sentence carefully
to grasp the full context.

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:11.835
Second, identify the confusing pair in
question and recall their unique meanings.

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.255
Third, analyze the sentence
structure to determine if you need

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:17.655
a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.830
Fourth, evaluate each option and see
how each word from the pair would

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.540
fit grammatically and logically.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.110
Fifth, test for logical flow by
putting your chosen word in the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.640
sentence and reading it aloud.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.220
If it sounds natural, you
are on the right track.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.860
And finally, eliminate
the incorrect options.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:34.465
Be ruthless.

00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:39.555
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to work smarter, not harder.

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:42.765
Of course, you do focus on the
core difference for each pair.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.585
Is it verb versus noun
or cause versus result?

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:48.075
Get familiar with common pair recognition.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:49.785
Practice is your best friend here.

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:53.445
Sometimes prefix or self-exclusion
can help you like other for

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:55.040
adjectives or titian for nouns.

00:03:55.665 --> 00:04:00.015
Also trust your first instinct, but with a
bit of caution if you've practiced enough.

00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:03.675
Your gut feeling is often right,
but always double check and the

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:05.805
ultimate shortcut practice regularly.

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:09.240
The more you see these pairs in different
contexts, the faster you'll become.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.420
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.340
Let's talk about the common traps.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.440
A big one is ignoring context.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.959
Just picking a word because
you know its general meaning.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.490
Another is confusing.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.380
Homophones, please don't mix up.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.790
There, there and there.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.790
Many friends overlook subtle
meaning differences like

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.350
between imply and in firm.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.390
Don't just rely on spelling either.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.640
Similar spellings don't mean similar uses.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.180
And a classic mistake is not
checking the part of speech, like

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.010
using a noun where a verb is needed.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.520
This is common with words like practice
and practice in British English.

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.070
W Edge Framework summary.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.979
So to wrap this up quickly,
what are we dealing with?

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.070
Words that sound alike, look
alike, or have similar meanings

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.240
but are used differently.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.500
Why is this important?

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.169
It's essential for clear,
precise communication.

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.620
When do we apply this in all
communication, especially in

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.150
formal and professional settings.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.289
Where is it relevant in reports,
emails, presentations, and daily chats.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.239
Who needs this?

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.060
Every professional, every
friend, and anyone who wants

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.349
to communicate with impact.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.250
And how do we master it by learning
their specific definitions, parts of

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.200
speech, and how they're used in context.

00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:17.895
Fully worked out examples.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:19.905
Let's solve some examples together.

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:22.125
Example, one question.

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.435
Choose the correct word
to complete the sentence.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:30.255
The new policy will dash a significant
change in operations A, effect B, effect

00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:35.415
C, effectivity D, effective understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.470
Okay, let's break it down.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.650
The sentence needs a verb to
say what the policy will do.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.320
Effect is usually a
noun, meaning a result.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.600
Effect is a verb meaning to influence.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.570
Effectivity is a noun, and
effective is an adjective.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.900
The policy will influence or
have an impact on the operations.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.530
While effect can be a verb, meaning
to bring about effect is the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.940
more common and fitting choice.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.090
Here, the policy will affect
the operations, correct.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.479
Answer B. Example two question.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.000
Which word correctly completes
the following sentence?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.110
Her kind words were A, his A compliment.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.469
B, complement C.
Complimentary D, compliance.

00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:20.055
Here the sentence implies, her words
added something to his efforts.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:23.865
Making them better or complete a
compliment with an I is praise.

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:27.615
A compliment with an E is something
that completes or makes perfect.

00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:31.155
Complimentary is an adjective,
and compliance is about yielding.

00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:34.485
The words didn't just praise his
efforts, they complimented them.

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:40.245
So compliment is the perfect fit, correct
answer, B. Example three question.

00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:42.795
Choose the correct pair of
words to fill in the blanks.

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.945
The school dash decided to teach
the students the importance

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:47.985
of moral dash A principle.

00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:52.035
Principle B, principle principles,
C principles principles,

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.745
D principle principles.

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:56.475
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:58.179
Okay, let's tackle this.

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.090
The first blank needs the person
in charge of a school, which

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.710
is the principal with an el.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.820
This immediately knocks out options
B and B. The second blank refers to

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.710
fundamental moral truths or rules.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.609
This is the definition of principle
with an so we need principle

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:14.109
first and principle Second.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:15.789
Option A. Fits perfectly.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.940
The school principal decided to
teach the importance of moral

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.760
principle, correct answer a Thank you.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.260
See you in the next lecture.
