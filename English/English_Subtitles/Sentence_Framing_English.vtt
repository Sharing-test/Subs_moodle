Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on sentence framing.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.440
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:13.635
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:17.505
So what is this fancy sounding sentence?

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:17.985
Framing.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.005
Think of it as the art
and science of cooking.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:28.185
A perfect ani, you can have all the
best ingredients, words, phrases,

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:32.850
clauses, but if you just throw them
in the pot randomly, you get a mess.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.739
Sentence framing is arranging those
ingredients in a logical order to

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.110
create a delicious, complete thought.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.970
A well framed sentence is like
a perfectly layered burani.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.300
The intended meaning is easily understood
with no ambiguity or confusion.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:59.290
The key masala here are proper subject web
agreement, correct tense usage, the right

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.530
punctuation, and a logical flow of ideas.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.125
It's not just about being
grammatically correct, my friend.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:11.240
It's about making your sentences
impactful and super easy to digest.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.890
Real world relevance.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.050
Now, you might think this is just
for scoring marks, but effective

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.880
sentence framing is crucial for
clear communication in every sector

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.400
of life in official documents.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.430
It ensures precision and clarity in things
like reports, contracts, and proposals.

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:38.515
One misplaced comma could mean a world
of difference during client interactions.

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:42.955
It seriously enhances your
communication effectiveness and makes

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.235
you sound like a true professional.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.315
It also helps in minimizing
misunderstandings, which

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:53.515
prevents all that confusion and
misinterpretation of information

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:55.795
saving you from future headaches.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:59.575
Ultimately, it builds your
professional credibility.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:04.795
It shows you are competent and builds
trust in any professional setting.

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:10.435
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam,

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:12.865
let's look at the usual suspects.

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:13.495
You will encount.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.640
First, the big boss of this topic is
sentence correction or improvement, which

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.450
makes up about 40 to 45% of the questions.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.370
Here you'll spot grammatical
errors or just awkward phrasing

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.440
and pick the best alternative.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.710
Next up we have sentence rearrangement.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:39.605
Also known as para jumbles,
covering 25 to 30%.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:45.815
This is like solving a puzzle, arranging
jumbled parts to make a coherent sentence.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:52.295
Then comes fill in the blanks, or
sentence completion, taking up 15 to 20%.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:56.940
You choose the most fitting word
or phrase to complete a sentence.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.030
And finally, the smaller players
are error, spotting and phrase

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.320
replacement, each making up
five to 10% of the questions.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.000
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
All right, let's get to the
secret formulas and tricks

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.030
for async sentence framing.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.590
Pay close attention.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.470
First is subject web agreement.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.399
A singular hero needs a
singular action and plural.

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.530
Heroes need a plural action.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.250
Simple.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.230
Then there's parallelism.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.180
Keep your lists consistent.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.300
If you start with ING
words, stick with them.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.430
For example, say reading, writing,
and speaking, not reading,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.830
writing, and to speak next.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:42.404
Pronoun agreement.

00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:47.385
Make sure your pronouns agree in
number, gender and person with

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.005
the nouns they are replacing.

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:50.415
Don't be lazy here.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.445
Also, maintain tense consistency.

00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:58.214
Don't jump between past, present
and future, like a time traveler

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.075
unless the story demands it.

00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:06.344
Use correct conjunctions like and
but or so to connect ideas logically.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.980
Modify a placement is crucial.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.720
Place adjectives and adverbs right
next to the words they are describing.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.850
To avoid hilarious confusion.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.370
Remember to avoid redundancy.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.160
Don't use 10 words when five will do.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.660
Be a master of punctuation
rules, especially for commerce,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.520
semicolons and colons.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.960
And finally, prefer the active
voice over the passive voice for

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.160
clear, direct sentences, unless
you have a good reason not to.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.395
Methods of solving.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:44.065
Here are some step-by-step methods
for tackling these questions for

00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.315
sentence correction or improvement.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:51.685
First, read the original sentence
carefully to understand its core meaning

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:58.045
identify the underlined part and hunt
for any potential errors or awkwardness.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.440
Scan all the options immediately.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.020
Eliminate any options that create new
errors, or completely change the meaning.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.450
Compare the good ones left and choose
the one that is grammatically perfect,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.480
concise, and keeps the original intent.

00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:18.734
For sentence rearrangement
or para jumbles.

00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:22.635
Read all the jumbled parts
to get a feel for the topic.

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:25.784
Look for the sentence
that can kick things off.

00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:31.305
Then find connecting words like however,
or therefore that create a chain.

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:35.294
Look for cause and effect
links or a sequence in time.

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:38.234
Try to form pairs that flow logically.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.465
Finally, arrange everything
into a sensible paragraph.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.239
For fill in the blanks, read the
sentence and focus on the context.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.729
Figure out what kind of word is
missing a noun, word or adjective.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.679
Consider the tone of the sentence,
then audition each option in the

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:02.450
blank to see which one fits best,
both grammatically and logically.

00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:07.015
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some ninja techniques.

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:10.555
First, always scan for
subject verb agreement.

00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:12.625
It's the most common mistake.

00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:15.055
Next, look for parallelism.

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:19.885
If you see a list or conjunctions
like and or, or check if the

00:06:19.885 --> 00:06:25.345
structure is consistent, always check
pronoun references to ensure every

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:27.685
pronoun has a clear parent noun.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:32.835
In long, complicated sentences,
try to identify the main clause.

00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:36.794
This helps you understand the
core idea and spot errors.

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:41.085
Eliminate options with obvious
grammatical errors right away.

00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:45.375
To save time, you can also try
the sound test with caution.

00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:47.325
Read the sentence in your head.

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:53.145
An awkward phrase often sounds wrong, but
always double check with grammar rules.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.930
Focus on concision.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.430
The shortest, most direct answer
is often the correct one, as

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.410
long as it's grammatically sound.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.590
And be careful with prepositional phrases.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.130
Their wrong placement can
create a lot of ambiguity.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.370
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.909
Let's talk about the common
traps people fall into.

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:20.310
A big one is subject verb disagreement,
especially when phrases come

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.960
between the subject and the verb.

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.360
For instance, the list of
items is long, not r long.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.750
Another is creating run-on sentences
and comma splices by joining two main

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.940
ideas without the right punctuation.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.460
Watch out for dangling
or misplaced modifiers.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.490
A sentence like walking through the park.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.900
The trees were beautiful.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.170
Hilariously implies the
trees were taking a stroll.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:53.770
Also be wary of incorrect tense usage
where you shift tenses for no reason.

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:58.120
Faulty parallelism is another
classic mistake where listed

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.280
items don't match grammatically.

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:04.545
Then there's pronoun ambiguity
using a pronoun that could

00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:06.135
refer to multiple nouns.

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:10.485
And please learn the difference
between effect, which is a verb

00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:12.765
and effect, which is a noun.

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:19.125
Finally, don't misuse apostrophes
for plurals, WH framework Summary.

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:22.845
So to wrap it all up,
what is sentence framing?

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:28.245
It is simply the process of constructing
grammatically correct and clear sentences.

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:30.015
Why is it so important?

00:08:30.255 --> 00:08:34.185
Because it is absolutely essential
for effective communication

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.255
and conveying precise meaning.

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:37.815
When is it applied?

00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:43.424
It's applied whenever we write or speak,
especially in formal situations like your

00:08:43.424 --> 00:08:46.485
exam reports and official communication.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.000
Where is it relevant?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.079
It is relevant everywhere from
academic writing and professional

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:54.390
settings to everyday conversations.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.400
Who uses it well?

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.420
Anyone who communicates through
written or spoken language benefits

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.890
from proper sentence framing.

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:03.660
And how is it applied?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.860
It is applied by following
grammar rules, ensuring a logical

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.060
flow, and practicing clarity and
conciseness in your expression.

00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:14.555
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:19.265
All right, let's put this theory
into practice with some examples.

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:21.905
Example, one question.

00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:26.704
Choose the option that best replaces
the underlined part of the sentence.

00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:31.685
The committee decided to postpone the
meeting, which was scheduled for next

00:09:31.685 --> 00:09:34.400
Tuesday due to unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.910
Options A, which was scheduled
for next Tuesday because of

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.710
unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.810
B. Scheduled for next Tuesday
due to unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.420
C. That was scheduled for next Tuesday
due to unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.520
D, which was scheduled for next Tuesday
due to unforeseen circumstances.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.620
Let's analyze this.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.790
The original sentence is
grammatically okay, but the phrase

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:06.280
which was scheduled is a bit wordy.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.310
We are looking for an improvement option.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.230
A just changes due to to, because
of which doesn't fix the wordiness.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.930
Option C uses that which is incorrect for
a non-essential clause set off by commas.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.630
Option D is just no change.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.470
Now look at option B
scheduled for next Tuesday.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.079
This is a reduced relative clause.

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:34.670
It's more concise, sounds more
professional, and improves the sentence

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.340
flow without changing the meaning one bit.

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:38.865
It's the sharpest choice.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.470
Correct answer B. Example two question.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.040
Select the most appropriate
word to fill in the blank.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.440
The manager's decision to implement
the new policy was met with dash

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.130
from the employees options A, apathy.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.815
B, enthusiasm, C,
resistance D, compliance.

00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:03.245
Understand the question before.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:07.445
Moving to explanation here, we
need a word that describes the

00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:09.875
employee's reaction to a new policy.

00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:11.705
Let's look at the options.

00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:16.535
Apathy means they didn't care
possible, but not the strongest fit.

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:16.715
For.

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.955
Met with enthusiasm means they loved it.

00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:22.630
Also possible, but maybe less common.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.645
Compliance means they followed
the rule, which is more of an

00:11:26.705 --> 00:11:28.565
outcome than an initial reaction.

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:33.295
But resistance, which means
they refuse to accept it fits

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:35.425
the phrase, met with perfectly.

00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:40.555
It suggests a direct opposing reaction,
which is a very common scenario.

00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:42.595
When new policies are introduced.

00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:46.525
It's the most logical and
powerful fit for the sentence

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:49.795
correct answer, C example three.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:57.070
Question, rearrange the following
parts, PQRS to form a meaningful

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.040
sentence, P, to ensure that.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.210
Q, the new security measures
are the company implemented

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.180
as all data was protected.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.380
Options.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:22.200
A-R-P-Q-S-B-Q-R-P-S-C-R-Q-P-S-D-S-P
QR understand the question

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.240
before moving to explanation.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.915
Let's solve this puzzle.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.220
We need a starting point.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.400
Part R, the company implemented.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.750
Looks like a great start because
it has a subject and a verb.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.060
What did the company implement?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.300
Part Q, the new security measures.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.100
So we have RQ.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.870
Why did they do this?

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:52.850
The purpose is given in Part P to ensure
that now we have R QP to ensure what?

00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:57.964
Part S, all data was protected,
completes the entire thought,

00:12:58.234 --> 00:13:00.964
so the full logical sentences.

00:13:01.234 --> 00:13:06.035
The company implemented the
new security measures to ensure

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.344
that all data was protected.

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:10.714
This perfectly matches the order.

00:13:10.984 --> 00:13:15.275
RQPS, correct answer C. Thank you.

00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:17.135
See you in the next lecture.
