Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on adjective.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.480
We're about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
with this tutorial concept explanation.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.155
All right, my friends.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.265
Let's dive straight into what
an adjective actually is.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:25.215
Think of it as a super helpful
word, a description expert, if

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:29.775
you will, that loves to tell us
more about a noun or a pronoun.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:31.605
It's not just sitting there.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.564
No, no.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.995
It provides extra information.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.940
Painting a clearer picture by telling
us about its quality, quantity number,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.730
or simply what kind of thing it is.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.620
When you are trying to figure out
if a word is an adjective, just

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.600
ask yourself these questions.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.350
What kind?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.670
How many.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.870
Which one or whose, for instance, when
we say big house, big is busy telling

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.850
us the size of the house, right?

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.150
Five friends tells us
the number of friends.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.530
Quite precisely.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.430
A beautiful flower describes
its lovely quality and.

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:15.655
Indian cuisine straight up tells you
the origin of that delicious food.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:20.755
Now, these clever adjectives can either
chill out before the noun they're

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:23.545
describing like big in big house.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:29.635
We call them attribute adjectives, or
they can show up after a linking verb.

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:36.115
Becoming a predicated adjective as in the
flour, is beautiful, simple, isn't it?

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:40.645
Just like adding a dash of extra
masala to your regular dish.

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.514
Real world relevance.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:49.125
Now, why is understanding adjectives
so important, especially for

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.285
those of you aiming for a career?

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:55.245
Well, my friends, it's not
just about passing your exam.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.385
It's about clear and precise
communication, and that, my

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.360
dear, is absolutely vital.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.869
First off for clear communication.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.150
Using precise adjectives helps you
convey accurate information about

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.829
all those complex financial products
and services to your clients.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.690
No room for confusion there.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.420
A. Imagine trying to sell a loan versus
a flexible low interest home loan.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.860
Big difference.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.550
Then we have report writing adjectives,
enable precise descriptions in all your

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.440
financial reports, risk assessments,
and those crucial market analysis You.

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:38.424
Can't just say market.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:42.265
You need volatile market or stable market.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:43.975
Precision is key.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:49.375
And finally, in client interaction,
knowing your adjectives helps in

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:54.265
effectively describing client needs
or even their account statuses.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.060
This naturally leads to
much, much better service.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.700
It's like knowing exactly which
button to press to get the perfect.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:06.585
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.385
All right, my friends.

00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:12.975
Let's talk strategy for your exam
in the English language section.

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:17.235
Questions related to adjectives
pop up primarily in a few

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:19.275
common formats, roughly.

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.515
Error spotting takes about 40% of the pie.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.000
Here you'll be identifying grammatical
errors related to adjective usage,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.930
like getting the degree of comparison
all wrong, picking the wrong

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.359
adjective, or even misplacing One
then comes sentence improvement or

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.459
correction, which accounts for about.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.190
30%. Here you'll be choosing the
correct option to replace an underlined

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.420
art of a sentence that you guessed
it contains an adjective error.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.210
Next, fill in the blanks covers
20%, where you simply select the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.140
most appropriate adjective from
the given options to complete a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.870
sentence logically and grammatically.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.800
And finally, phrase replacement
or sentence completion

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.870
makes up the remaining 10%.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.430
This is quite similar to sentence
improvement, but it specifically

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.470
focuses on replacing a phrase
with an adjective or an a phrase.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.150
So you see, knowing your adjectives
is like having a secret weapon.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.690
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.400
Now for the LY formulas and
tricks, pay close attention.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.650
This is where the magic happens.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.710
First up, degrees of comparison for
adjectives with one or two syllables.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.580
It's simple.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.260
Just add, uh, for the comparative
and s for the superlative.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.260
Think small, smaller, smallest.

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.400
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.289
But when you hit adjectives with
three or more syllables, you switch

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.210
to using more for comparative and
most for superlative, for example.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.260
Important.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.570
More important, most important.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:04.165
No, uh, or est there, mind you.

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:07.915
And then we have those
irregular adjectives.

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:09.625
These are the rebels.

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:13.825
They don't follow the rules, so you
just have to memorize their forms,

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:20.485
like, good, better, best or bad,
worse, worst, and much, many more.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:22.705
Most just mug them up.

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:23.995
No shortcut there.

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:26.075
Now this is a gem.

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:27.725
Absolute adjectives.

00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:32.525
Some adjectives like perfect,
unique, complete, excellent,

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:34.715
or excellent or impossible.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.755
Denote an absolute state.

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:38.555
They are what they are.

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:41.525
They can't be more perfect or most unique.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:42.665
Think about it.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.095
How can something be more unique?

00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:47.855
It's either unique or it's not right?

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:49.175
These words are.

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:56.125
O-S-A-S-C-O-M-P.

00:05:56.485 --> 00:06:00.565
When you have a bunch of adjectives
trying to describe a single noun,

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:02.695
they can't just line up anywhere.

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:05.905
There's a proper cue,
a h rocking my friends.

00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:11.545
It generally follows this order opinion
like beautiful, lovely, then size.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:18.955
Big, small age old, new shape, round
square color, red, blue origin,

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:22.135
Indian French material, wooden silk.

00:06:22.255 --> 00:06:25.795
And finally, purpose
sleeping bag, running shoes.

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:31.945
So if you say a beautiful, small, old
round red Indian wooden writing table,

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:34.165
you are following the perfect order.

00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:34.915
Wow.

00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:38.515
Don't get confusion between
adjectives and adverbs.

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:42.045
Remember an adjective
is a nouns best friend.

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:47.625
It describes a noun or pronoun, an
adverb on the other hand, is for verbs,

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:50.295
adjectives, or even other adverbs.

00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:52.695
Make sure you use the correct form.

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.034
He is a quick runner here.

00:06:55.305 --> 00:07:00.135
Quick is an adjective modifying
runner, but he runs quickly.

00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:00.675
Here.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.375
Quickly is an adverb modifying runs.

00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:04.665
See the difference.

00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:09.225
One is describing him, the
other is describing how he runs.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:13.095
Then the classic confusion,
fewer versus less.

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:17.295
This one trips up many fewer
is for countable amounts.

00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:22.485
Things you can count individually,
like fewer books or fewer friends.

00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:24.915
Less is for uncountable nouns.

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:26.925
Things you can't count individually.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.895
Think less water, less time or less drama.

00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:32.695
Simple once you get it.

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:39.174
And finally, elder or eldest versus
older or oldest elder and eldest

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:41.484
are specifically for family members.

00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:42.445
You'd say?

00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:45.565
My elder brother, not my older brother.

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:47.215
If you're talking about your sibling.

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:50.845
Older and oldest are for
general age comparison.

00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:54.985
So this building is older than
that one is perfectly fine.

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:59.155
It's all about context, my
friends methods of solving.

00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:00.675
All right.

00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:06.015
Let's talk about the practical methods for
tackling adjective questions in your exam.

00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.855
First, identify the word being modified.

00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:12.915
This is step one, the foundation.

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:18.135
Locate the noun or pronoun that the
adjective is supposed to describe.

00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:24.344
This helps you figure out if an adjective
is even needed, and if so, what kind.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.640
Simple right next.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:28.950
Check for degrees of comparison.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.620
If the sentence is making a comparison
between two or more items, immediately

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.470
ensure that the correct degree, positive,
comparative, or superlative is being used.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:45.155
Be on the lookout for keywords
like Dan for comparative or

00:08:45.155 --> 00:08:46.985
the before a superlative.

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:48.545
These are your clues.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.635
Then verify adjective order.

00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:56.194
If you see multiple adjectives hanging
out together, check if they are

00:08:56.194 --> 00:08:59.855
following our famous O-S-A-S-C-O-M rule.

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:04.985
If they're all jumbled up, rearrange them
in your mind for grammatical correctness.

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:07.165
It's like organizing your wardrobe.

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:11.574
A very important step is to
distinguish from adverbs.

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:16.735
Always confirm that the word
modifying a noun or pronoun is indeed

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:18.865
an adjective and not an adverb.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.574
Remember, adverbs typically
end in LY, but not always.

00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:24.714
So stay sharp.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:27.040
Always scrutinize, quantifiers.

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:32.375
For quantities, double check that fewer
and less are being used correctly,

00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:36.574
matching them with countable and
uncountable nouns, respectively.

00:09:36.814 --> 00:09:38.224
This is a common trap.

00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:41.584
Also look for absolute adjectives.

00:09:42.094 --> 00:09:47.405
Quickly identify if any of those absolute
adjectives are being used incorrectly

00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.775
with comparative or superlative forms.

00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:53.615
No, most unique or more
perfect, please, my friends.

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:56.935
And finally, don't just stop at grammar.

00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:00.055
Always consider contextual
appropriateness.

00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:03.985
Does the chosen adjective
actually make logical sense in

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:05.515
the context of the sentence?

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:09.085
Sometimes a word can be
grammatically correct, but

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:11.215
just sound odd or outta place.

00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:12.775
Use your common sense.

00:10:12.865 --> 00:10:18.055
It's your best friend, shortcuts
and smart techniques now for some

00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:22.060
clever shortcuts and smart techniques
to save you time in the exam.

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:30.104
Scan for Dan or the, this is a golden
rule in error spotting questions.

00:10:30.314 --> 00:10:34.755
If you spot Dan immediately look
for a comparative adjective.

00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:39.645
If you see the look for a
superlative adjective, a very

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:41.505
common error is a missing.

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:44.849
The before a superlative,
so keep an eye out for it.

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:48.165
Count syllables for degree.

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:54.525
A quick trick rapidly count the syllables
for adjectives to quickly determine if you

00:10:54.525 --> 00:11:01.005
should use uh, or S or more or most for
their comparative and superlative forms.

00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:03.135
It's a quick mental check.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.630
Identify common confusions.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.470
Train your eye to instantly
spot common pitfalls.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.470
Think good versus well, fewer
versus less elder versus older.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.980
These are repeat
offenders, so be vigilant.

00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:25.965
Eliminate obvious adverb options
in multiple choice questions.

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:32.145
If an option is a word ending in ly and
it's presented as an adjective choice

00:11:32.145 --> 00:11:37.365
for a noun, it's almost certainly
incorrect, unless, of course, it's

00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:42.615
one of those tricky adjectives that
also ends in LY, like friendly.

00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:48.645
But generally, if it's meant to describe
a noun and ends in LY, be suspicious.

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:55.229
Subject verb, object, adjective
flow, mentally break down sentences

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.000
into their core components.

00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:02.250
This helps you clearly see what the
adjective is actually modifying and

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.620
whether it's doing its job correctly.

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:08.310
Quick check for absolute adjectives.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.150
Have a mental checklist of
absolute adjectives ready.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.680
This way you can quickly spot
any incorrect, comparative, or

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.959
superlative usage involving them.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.079
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.390
Or, write my friends, let's shine
a light on the common pitfalls, the

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.060
traps that many candidates fall into.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.739
Don't be one of them.

00:12:32.865 --> 00:12:36.735
The biggest one is incorrect
degree of comparison.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:41.475
You'll often say more happier
instead of just happier.

00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:44.775
That's a double comparative, a big no-no.

00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:50.535
Or most best, instead of simply,
best, which is a double superlative.

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:52.785
Remember, one is enough.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.719
Next, confusion between
adjectives and adverbs.

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:04.349
This is a classic using an adjective where
an adverb is clearly needed, like saying

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.800
he sings good instead of he sings well.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.204
Remember good describes a noun well,
describes how something is done.

00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:16.665
Then misplacing adjectives.

00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:21.045
Placing an adjective in the wrong
spot can make your sentence sound

00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:24.165
utterly confusing or just plain wrong.

00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:30.045
For example, she bought a new red
car is correct, saying she bought a

00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:33.255
red new car is an incorrect order.

00:13:33.255 --> 00:13:35.840
Always keep O-S-A-C-O-M-P in mind.

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:41.204
Using absolute adjectives
with degrees is another one.

00:13:41.474 --> 00:13:42.435
Please know.

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:44.834
Most unique or more perfect.

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:48.615
These adjectives describe
absolute complete states.

00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:51.300
They can't be more or most of anything.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.780
They're already there.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.380
And the fewer, less dilemma,
incorrect usage of fewer and less

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.230
saying less people is incorrect.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.160
It should be fewer people
because people are countable

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.040
Similarly, fewer sugar is wrong.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.060
It should be less sugar
because sugar is uncountable.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.380
Get this right.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.730
It's fundamental.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.030
While not a grammatical error,
overuse of adjectives can make your

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.219
writing cumbersome and unclear.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.099
Sometimes simplicity is elegance.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.665
Don't just stuff adjectives everywhere,
like extra clothes in a suitcase.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:37.530
And finally, a common misconception,
assuming all L words are adverbs,

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.470
while many adverbs do end in LY,
remember some words that end in LY are

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.650
actually adjectives, think friendly,
lively, lovely, costly, elderly.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.970
So don't jump to conclusions
just because of an LY ending.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.810
WH framework summary.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:02.420
Let's quickly sum up this concept
using our familiar WH framework.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.969
So what is an adjective?

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.040
It's a word that describes or
modifies a noun or a pronoun.

00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:11.300
Simple as that.

00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:17.900
Why do we use them to add detail,
clarity, and specificity to nouns

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.060
and pronouns in our sentences.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.579
They give life to our descriptions.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.400
When do we use them?

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:29.650
We use them when we want to provide
more information about a noun,

00:15:29.739 --> 00:15:32.680
quality, quantity, or characteristic.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.449
Where are they found?

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:39.219
You'll typically find them in
sentences, usually before nouns

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.900
or after linking verbs patiently
waiting to describe something.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.580
Who uses them?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.670
Well, speakers, writers, and frankly,
all learners of a language, use

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.630
them to enrich their descriptions
and make things more vivid.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.940
And how are they applied By placing
them appropriately in a sentence

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.890
to modify the intended word.

00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:07.595
Often following specific
rules of order and comparison.

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:11.315
It's like placing the right
spice in the right dish.

00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:12.935
Fully worked out.

00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:13.775
Examples.

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:15.545
All right, my friends.

00:16:15.785 --> 00:16:20.465
Let's solidify our understanding
with some fully worked out examples.

00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:23.405
This is where theory meets practice.

00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:26.090
Example, one degree of comparison.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:34.390
Question, the new policy is A, more
better B, better C, most better

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.030
D, good than the previous one.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.760
Options A more better.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.090
B, better C, most better.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.380
D, good.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:50.350
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, step-by-step solution.

00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:54.475
Step one first, let's
analyze the sentence.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:17:00.475
See that word then in the sentence that
immediately tells us a comparison is

00:17:00.475 --> 00:17:06.474
happening between two things, the new
policy and the previous one, step two.

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:10.615
So we need to identify the
type of adjective needed.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:16.740
Since it's a comparison between two items,
we definitely need a comparative degree.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.490
Adjective.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.220
No positive, no superlative here.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.450
Step three.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.620
Now let's evaluate the options one by one.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.450
A more better.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.900
Better is already the
comparative form of good.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.540
Adding more makes it a double comparative,
which is grammatically incorrect.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.210
It's like seeing more, more good.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.840
B better.

00:17:41.139 --> 00:17:44.230
Ah, this is the correct
comparative form of good.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.760
It fits perfectly.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.649
C most better.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.960
Most is for the superlative degree
used when comparing three or more

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.540
things and better is comparative.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.120
So this is a confused option.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.370
Incorrect D. Good.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.110
This is the positive degree used
when no comparison is being made.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.090
Not appropriate Here is it?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.230
Step four.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.110
Finally, we select the correct option.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:17.740
The correct comparative form is simply
better correct answer is option B, better

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.670
example, two adjective adverb, confusion.

00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:23.095
Question.

00:18:23.515 --> 00:18:26.305
She sings A real good.

00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:28.285
B, really good.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:34.105
C, really well D. Good when
she's performing on stage.

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:42.415
Options A real good B, really
good C. Really well D. Good.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.050
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.350
Step-by-step solution.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.910
Step one, let's identify
the word being modified.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.960
The word we are interested
in here is the verb sings.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.800
We need a word that
tells us how she sings.

00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:07.995
Step two now, determine if an
adjective or adverb is needed.

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:13.995
Since we are describing how a verb is
performed, we absolutely need an adverb.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.215
Adjectives describe nouns.

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.225
Adverbs describe verbs.

00:19:18.465 --> 00:19:19.395
Clear, right.

00:19:20.385 --> 00:19:21.285
Step three.

00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:23.835
Time to evaluate the options.

00:19:24.255 --> 00:19:30.945
A real good here, real is an adjective,
and good is also an adjective.

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:36.555
This phrase uses two adjectives, neither
of which correctly modifies the verb.

00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:41.655
Sings real, should be really
an adverb and good should be.

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:43.395
Well, also an adverb.

00:19:43.755 --> 00:19:46.935
It's like trying to put
square pegs in round holes.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.330
B really good, really is an
adverb, which is good so far.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.910
But good is still an adjective.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.670
We need an adverb to describe the verb.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.950
Sings still not quite there.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.900
C really well.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.860
Ah, this looks promising,
really is an adverb.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.235
Modifying well and well is an adverb
that correctly modifies the verb Sings.

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:13.575
This is the perfect pair.

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:14.925
D. Good.

00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:17.325
This is purely an adjective.

00:20:17.625 --> 00:20:23.325
It would work if we were describing a
noun, like she is a good singer, but not

00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:25.395
for describing the action of singing.

00:20:25.755 --> 00:20:31.125
Step four, so we select the correct
option, the correct adverbs to

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:38.025
describe things are really well correct
answer is option C. Really well.

00:20:39.074 --> 00:20:43.034
Example, three order
of adjectives question.

00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:49.935
My grandmother bought A, a beautiful
antique wooden small, B, small, beautiful

00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:56.415
antique wooden C, small wooden antique,
beautiful D, beautiful small antique

00:20:56.415 --> 00:20:57.735
wooden box at the auction options.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.950
A beautiful antique wooden small,
B, small, beautiful antique wooden

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.830
C, small wooden antique, beautiful
D, beautiful small antique wooden.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.370
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.220
Step-by-step solution.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.420
Step one.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.060
First, let's identify the noun.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.890
The noun being described.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.360
Here is the box.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.440
Simple enough.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.090
Step two, now list the
adjectives and the categories.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.740
Let's break them down.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:32.880
Beautiful.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.680
That's an opinion, right?

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.445
Small, that tells us about size.

00:21:38.115 --> 00:21:43.125
Antique that indicates its age
wooden, and that's the material

00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:45.135
it's made of Step three.

00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:46.905
Time to apply the os.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.015
A comp rule.

00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:49.755
Order of adjectives.

00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:53.150
Remember our VIPQ opinion size.

00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:57.955
Age, shape, color,
origin, material, purpose.

00:21:58.315 --> 00:22:06.085
Following this order, opinion, beautiful
size, small age, antique material, wooden.

00:22:06.355 --> 00:22:11.305
Step four, let's formulate the
correct order based on OSAs

00:22:11.305 --> 00:22:12.925
comp, the correct sequences.

00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:15.895
Beautiful, small, antique, wooden.

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:17.065
Step five.

00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:19.764
Finally, we evaluate the options.

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:23.919
A beautiful antique wooden,
small incorrect order.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:30.010
Antique, again, age comes before wooden
material and small, which is wrong.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.695
B, small, beautiful, antique wooden,
incorrect order, small, which is size.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.300
Is before beautiful opinion.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.430
Opinion always comes first.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.310
C, small, wooden, antique, beautiful.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.230
Completely incorrect order.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.420
This one is all over the place.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.860
D. Beautiful small antique wooden, bingo.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.160
This one perfectly matches
our OSA comp order.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.410
Correct answer is option D.
Beautiful, small, antique wooden.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.340
Thank you.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.870
See you in the next lecture.
