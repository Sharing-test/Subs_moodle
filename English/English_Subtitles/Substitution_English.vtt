Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Substitution.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.440
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.160
This is it.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:16.155
Concept explanation In the competitive
world of your exam, my friend substitution

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.855
usually means one word substitution.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:22.064
Think of it as a linguistic magic trick.

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:28.035
You take a big, long phrase and poof,
it becomes a single powerful word.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:34.935
The goal you ask to make your sentences
sharp, impactful, and economical without

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.635
losing an ounce of their original meaning.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.630
For instance, instead of saying
a person who loves books,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.910
we simply say, bibliophile.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.380
Much cooler, right?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
Or a place where birds
are kept, becomes aviary.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.850
This concept isn't just for fancy talk.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.860
It's vital for supercharging your
vocabulary, refining your writing style,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
and truly understanding those complex
texts without getting a headache.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.970
These one word substitutions are a
hot favorite in the English language

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.610
sections of various competitive exams.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
They're there to check your
vocabulary, your comprehension, and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.180
your knack for expressing ideas.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
Crisply, you'll often find these
questions asking you to pick the perfect

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.350
single word from a bunch of options to
replace a given phrase or definition.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.120
It's like finding a needle in
a haystack, but with words.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:37.395
Real world relevance now for future.

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:40.935
Having a strong vocabulary,
including these one word

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.665
substitutions is absolutely crucial.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:48.015
Imagine drafting official
documents or trying to understand

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:49.845
complex financial jargon.

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:54.405
Clear communication is key,
and brevity is the soul of wit

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:56.535
and of efficient paperwork.

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:02.475
Breakdown of question types in the
English section of your exam, my friend.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:07.815
One word substitution questions usually
pop up in a few exciting formats.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.695
First up, the direct substitution.

00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:16.815
About 50% of the time here a phrase
or a sentence is given, and you, my

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:21.615
friend, must choose the single word
that replaces it best from the options

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.435
straightforward, like a good masala chai.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:31.625
Then we have sentence improvement or
correction, roughly 30% a part of the

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:36.425
sentence is underlined, and you need to
pick an option that correctly substitutes

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.795
that underlined phrase with a single word.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.015
But wait, there's a catch.

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:45.755
It also needs to be grammatically
correct and contextually spot on.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.615
No loose ends please.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:53.145
Finally, about 20% are fill in
the blanks, a sentence with a

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:55.665
gapping hole, a blank is presented.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:59.655
Your mission should you choose to
accept it, is to fill it with the

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:03.855
most suitable one word, substitution
from the options to complete the

00:03:03.855 --> 00:03:09.285
sentences, meaning it's like solving
a crossword puzzle, but for your exam.

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:11.795
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.655
All right, so no magic
mathematical formulas for one

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.545
word substitution here, my friend.

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.015
But don't fret.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:25.475
We have some super effective strategies
and tricks that can significantly

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:27.154
help you conquer this topic.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.590
First categorization groups.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.040
Similar.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.450
One word substitutions.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.940
Think words related to professions.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.670
Your biggest fears, interesting places,
deep studies, even government types.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.365
This way learning becomes systematic
and recalling them is a breeze.

00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:48.704
Next root word analysis.

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:53.144
Many English words are like a
big family, all derived from

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:55.065
Latin or Greek root words.

00:03:55.454 --> 00:04:01.035
Understanding common roots, prefixes
and suffixes can give you a superpower.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:04.214
You can deduce the meaning
of unfamiliar words.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.214
For example, file means love.

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:12.405
So Biblio file is a lover of
books and audio file love sound.

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:14.185
See, clever, isn't it?

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:17.635
Another example, sight means killing.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:24.055
Hence IDE is killing of a king and
infanticide is well, killing of an infant.

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:29.005
Morbid, but helpful for W.
Then contextual learning.

00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:33.534
Don't just mug up words from a
list like a parrot Try learning

00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:37.284
one word, substitutions within
full sentences of phrases.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.210
This helps you grasp their proper usage.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.850
It's like learning to drive You don't just
read the manual, you get behind the wheel.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.790
Flashcards are your best friends here.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.660
Phrase on one side, one word,
substitution on the other.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.310
Review them regularly.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.130
It's old school, but it works wonders.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:00.855
Regular revision is
non-negotiable, my friend.

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:05.745
Consistent revision of learned words
is crucial for long-term memory.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:10.395
Dedicate specific time slots for
reviewing those previously studied words.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.955
Consistency is key, like
making good chai every day.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.590
And finally practice with
previous year questions.

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:22.640
Solving questions from past
competitive exams is like getting

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.530
a sneak peek into the exam hall.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.150
It helps you understand the pattern
and types of one word substitutions.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.310
Frequently asked, you'll know
what to expect Methods of solving.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.159
Solving one word substitution questions
effectively is a blend of knowing

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.799
your words and thinking strategically.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.979
First, read the phrase carefully.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.330
Don't rush.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.979
Understand the exact meaning of
the given phrase or sentence.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.960
Pay attention to those little
keywords that define the core concept.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.520
It's like listening carefully to
your mom's instructions for dinner.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.490
Then analyze the options.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.880
Don't just jump to the
first one that looks good.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.480
Go through all the provided
multiple choice options.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.610
Even if you think you know the answer,
crosscheck, there might be a more

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.430
precise or appropriate word hiding there.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.940
Next, the Mighty Elimination method.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.349
If you are unsure, start knocking
off options that are clearly

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.570
wrong or don't fit the context.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.850
This little trick dramatically increases
your chances of picking the right answer.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.820
It's like filtering out the
unnecessary drama from your life.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.340
Consider the contextual fit.

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.140
How would each option blend into
the original sentence or phrase?

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.909
The word you pick must not just
convey the meaning, but also keep the

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.610
grammatical structure and flow intact.

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:56.925
It needs to fit like a glove.

00:06:57.565 --> 00:07:03.085
For longer or complex phrases, try
to break down complex phrases, chop

00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:05.544
them into smaller, digestible parts.

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:10.854
This helps in identifying the core
idea that needs to be substituted.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:17.455
Think of it as disassembling a complicated
toy to understand how it works, and

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.065
sometimes just recall related words.

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:24.545
Think of synonyms, antonyms, or
words from the same category.

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:29.105
This can sometimes magically trigger
the correct one word, substitution.

00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:32.224
It's like your brain
doing a quick keyword.

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:38.315
Search, shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart moves, my friend.

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:42.760
Here are some shortcuts and
techniques to make you a pro.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.920
Try active recall.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:51.235
Instead of passively reading lists,
actively test yourself after learning

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:55.555
a bunch of words, try to recall
them without peeking at the list.

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:57.625
It builds mental muscle.

00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:03.294
Then there's spaced repetition,
review words at increasing intervals.

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:07.905
Maybe after a day, then
three days, then a week.

00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:14.055
This method is incredibly effective for
locking words into your long-term memory.

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:17.055
It's like giving your
brain many refreshers.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.580
Monic devices are super fun.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.880
Create associations, acronyms, or even
silly visual cues to remember tricky

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.490
words, for example, to remember.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.560
Biblio file Lover of books.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.700
You can imagine biblio sounding like
Bible, a book and file like feel, love.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:39.330
See.

00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:43.395
Instant recall, daily
practice is paramount.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:48.285
Dedicate a small amount of time
each day to learning and reviewing.

00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:51.314
These words don't cram everything at once.

00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:54.344
Consistency is better than intensity.

00:08:54.614 --> 00:08:56.719
Just like eating your veggies daily.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.505
And here's a real gem.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.515
Use in sentences.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:06.165
Try to weave newly learned one
word substitutions into your daily

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:11.204
conversations or writing This
practical application solidifies your

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:14.265
understanding and makes recall effortless.

00:09:14.564 --> 00:09:16.439
Practice makes perfect my friend.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:22.064
Lastly, group by theme, learning
words that belong to a specific

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:27.015
theme, like different types of fear,
various people or unique places,

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:31.905
can make the whole process much more
organized and easier to remember.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:36.375
It's like having neatly sorted
drawers for your clothes, common

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.625
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.620
Now let's talk about the
traps to avoid my friend.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.180
One big one is confusing
similar sounding words.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.830
Many words sound alike, but have
completely different meanings

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.810
like homophones or are spelled
similarly but used differently.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.990
For example, eligible qualified
versus ill eligible unreadable.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.760
Don't let them trick you.

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:07.834
Then there's ignoring context.

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:13.385
Choosing a word that fits the literal
meaning, but completely misses the overall

00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:16.234
context of the sentence or passage.

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:21.245
Always check the bigger picture, like
when you're judging a cricket match.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.810
Be careful about overlooking
negative prefixes.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:32.979
Failing to spot prefixes like un
in M dis non, that flip the meaning

00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:35.680
of a word can lead to big blunders.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.625
Unbelievable means not believable.

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:43.535
Obviously another mistake
is lack of precision.

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:47.855
Picking a word that's too general
when there's a more specific

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:50.075
one word substitution available.

00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:54.935
Always aim for precision
like a sniper, not a shotgun.

00:10:55.385 --> 00:11:00.935
And please avoid memorizing in
isolation, learning words without

00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:05.045
truly understanding their nuances
or how they behave in sentences.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.360
This leads to incorrect application.

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:12.200
Making your vocabulary look
impressive, but sound off

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.540
understand before your parrot.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.760
Finally, the classic.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.560
Not practicing enough, just
memorizing lists isn't enough.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.330
You need consistent practice
through exercises and mock tests.

00:11:26.814 --> 00:11:28.340
It's like learning to swim.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.230
You can't just read about it.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.000
You have to jump in the water.

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:35.400
WH framework summary.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.990
Let's quickly sum up this concept
using a famous WH framework.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.569
So what is substitution?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.230
It's simply replacing a
phrase with a single word that

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.329
conveys the exact same meaning.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.010
Why do we do it?

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.140
To boost your vocabulary, make your
language more concise, and ensure

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.600
your communication is super effective.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.550
When is it important?

00:12:00.015 --> 00:12:04.785
It's frequently tested in competitive
exams, like your exam, to check your

00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:07.334
vocabulary and comprehension prowess.

00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:09.255
Where can you apply this?

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:14.175
It's super applicable in both written
and spoken English for achieving

00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:16.545
brevity and crystal clear clarity.

00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:18.314
Who benefits from this?

00:15:53.685 --> 00:16:02.055
Options A irrevocable B,
immutable C, infallible D Indel.

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:07.515
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:13.845
Step one, understand the underlined
phrase, incapable of being recalled or

00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:20.205
revoked means something that cannot be
changed or taken back like a decision

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:21.435
your parents made after saying no.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.470
Step two, analyze the options.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.480
A irrevocable.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.160
This means not able to be
changed, reversed, or recovered.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.080
Final, perfect fit.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.970
B Immutable.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.830
This also means unchanging over
time or unable to be changed.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.500
Close, but not quite the precise
meaning of recalled or revoked.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:51.949
C infallible means incapable of
making mistakes or being wrong, not

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:54.530
related to recalling or revoking.

D indelible, not able to
be forgotten or removed.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.790
Often referring to Marx or memories.

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:03.915
Again, not the right fit.

00:17:04.245 --> 00:17:07.005
Step three, identify the best fit.

00:17:07.454 --> 00:17:12.075
While immutable means unchanging,
irrevocable specifically

00:17:12.075 --> 00:17:15.795
refers to something that
cannot be recalled or revoked.

00:17:16.065 --> 00:17:19.454
This precisely matches the
meaning of the phrase in the

00:17:19.454 --> 00:17:21.405
context of a government decree.

00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:25.125
Correct answer is option A. Thank you.
