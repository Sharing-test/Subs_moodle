Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Para Jumbles.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.900
Explanation.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.150
Now, para jumbles also famously
known as sentence rearrangement

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.950
or paragraph completion.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.080
I like that one draw in your kitchen
that has everything jumbled up, right.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.365
Your task is to put it all back in order.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.250
These questions are a common
and super significant part of

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.930
the English language section.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.940
In competitive examinations.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.990
Like your exam here, you are
presented with a bunch of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.030
sentences all out of whack.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.500
And your mission should you choose
to accept it, is to arrange them in

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.170
into a coherent, logical paragraph.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.920
Imagine if you will, a beautiful story
that's been chopped up and thrown at you.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.150
When correctly arranged, these
sentences will flow smoothly.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.890
One idea, connecting to the next,
forming a truly meaningful passage.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
This whole exercise, my friend, is
designed to test your understanding

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.910
of logical connectivity, how grammar
links things, and the contextual

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.160
relationships between sentences.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
It demands that you identify the
filmy opening sentence, spot, the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.360
connecting ideas like a detective.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.570
Recognize the grand
concluding statement and.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.190
Overall theme or narrative.

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:34.600
Mastering para jumbles is not
just crucial for boosting your

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.160
score in the English section.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.530
It's like a secret superpower.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:44.020
It enhances your reading comprehension
and analytical skills, which let me

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.729
tell you are absolutely vital for
understanding complex information

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.770
in any professional setting.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.705
Think of it as brain yoga.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.030
Real world relevance.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.140
Now, why is this so important
for an officer you ask?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.820
Well, my friend proficiency in
organizing jumbled information is

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.009
absolutely crucial for someone who has
to process and present complex data

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.860
clearly, just like your chi needs to be.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:13.075
Perfectly brooded.

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:18.805
First off, for report writing, you need
to structure clear and logical reports

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:23.995
for internal and external stakeholders,
not just dump information like a subs.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:27.055
Then there's case analysis.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:31.765
You'll be arranging disparate pieces
of information to form a coherent

00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:33.685
understanding of a situation.

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:36.295
No one wants a confused detective, right?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
Policy interpretation, or definitely
you'll be deciphering complex

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.130
legal or financial documents by
understanding the flow of arguments.

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.959
It's like understanding a lawyer's
handwriting, but logically and

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.119
of course customer communication.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.630
Presenting information to
clients in an organized and.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.560
Easy to understand manner because
happy customers are loyal customers.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
Strategic planning involves
organizing thoughts and data to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.829
formulate effective strategies.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.769
No chaos, only calculated moves.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.630
Finally, problem solving,
systematically arranging facts to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.370
identify root causes and solutions,
just like finding that missing sock.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.280
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.109
All right, my friends.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.180
Let's talk about the types of para
jumbles you might encounter in your exam.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.210
They typically appear in a few recurring
formats with varying levels of complexity,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.640
like different levels in a video game.

00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:44.245
While the exact percentage frequency can
fluctuate, here's a general breakdown.

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:49.405
Based on past exam patterns,
the most common one making up

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:54.385
about 60 to 70% of the questions
is basic sentence arrangement.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.130
Here you get four to six sentences
all jumbled up and you need to arrange

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.350
them to form a coherent paragraph.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.210
These usually test your ability
to identify logical connections

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.770
and the overall theme, it's the
bread and butter of para jumbles.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.570
Next up around 10 to
15% is the odd one out.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.579
Type in this variation.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.910
You are given a set of
sentences and one of them.

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:26.544
The misfit just doesn't belong to
the theme or context of the others.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:32.815
Your task is to play detective and
identify this outlier sentence like a

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:38.965
Bollywood villain trying to blend in
another 10 to 15% fall into the fixed

00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:41.575
sentence para jumbles category Here.

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:46.735
The first and or last sentence of the
paragraph is fixed, like the starting

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.865
and ending points of a train journey.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.170
You just need to arrange the
remaining jumble sentences in between.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.060
This provides a bit of a roadmap,
making the task slightly easier,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.740
a small relief, you know.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.460
Then we have paragraph completion about
five to 10% of the time a paragraph is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.470
given with a blank space, like a missing
piece of a jigsaw puzzle, and you need

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.240
to choose the most appropriate sentence
from the given options to logically and

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.520
contextually complete the paragraph.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.830
And very rarely, but still possible
are theme-based para jumbles.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.450
Here the sentences might revolve
around a specific theme, and

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.650
understanding that theme is the golden
key to arranging them correctly.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.450
Para Jumbles usually account for
four to five questions in the English

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.440
section of your exam, making them
a significant scoring opportunity.

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:46.905
So mastering these different types
and the underlying principles of

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.845
logical flow is absolutely essential.

00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:54.345
Don't underestimate them, my
friends formulas and tricks.

00:05:54.825 --> 00:06:00.315
Now you might be thinking formulas
for English, so well, my friend,

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:05.565
while para jumbles don't involve
mathematical formulas like E is

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:10.455
equal to mc square, they definitely
have a set of logical rules.

00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:16.545
And tricks and trust me when applied
systematically, these can significantly

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:18.825
improve your accuracy and speed.

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:23.145
Consider them your DEI Jugar
for solving these problems.

00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:26.205
Key logical rules, your formulas.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.880
One, identify the opening
sentence introduction.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.690
Always look for sentences that introduce
a topic, a person, a concept, or an event.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.210
These are usually general statements,
definitions, or independent ideas

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.790
that don't need any prior context.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.830
Now, here's the trick.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.040
Avoid sentences starting
with pronouns like he.

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:59.015
She, it, they, this, that, these,
those also be wary of conjunctions.

00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:04.805
Like, and, but so therefore,
however, or transition words like

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:06.870
firstly, moreover, in addition.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.690
Unless, of course, they clearly refer
to something already established

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.710
in a previous sentence, which
would then be your actual opening.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.080
The simple trick here is a good
opening sentence can stand alone and

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.510
make perfect sense without a warmup.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.650
Two, identify connecting ideas linkages.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.080
This is where the magic happens.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.170
One.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:33.105
Pronoun links a pronoun.

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:40.605
He, she, it, they, this, that, these,
those must always refer back to a noun.

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:41.955
Introduced earlier.

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:46.635
Find the noun that the pronoun is
replacing, like connecting the dots.

00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:48.735
Two transition words.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.840
Phrases, words like, however,
therefore, moreover, in addition,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.870
consequently similarly, for example,
thus, finally, are your best friends.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.630
They tell you exactly what kind of logical
relationship exits between sentences.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.100
Is it a contrast?

00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:11.364
Cause effect and addition, a
conclusion, listen to them.

00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:12.145
Three.

00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:13.585
Keyword repetition.

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:18.474
Sometimes sentences, just keep
repeating key nouns or concepts.

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:21.294
This repetition isn't just for emphasis.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:25.104
It's a golden thread helping
you link sentences together.

00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:25.854
Four.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.099
Cause and effect.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.740
Look for sentences where one describes why
something happened the cause and another

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.080
describes what happened as a result.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:42.460
The effect like I ate too much burani
cause consequently I felt sleepy Effect.

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.350
Five time sequence.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.720
If the passage is telling a story or a
process, words indicating time first.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.850
Then next, finally.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:58.610
Later in 1990, for example, are your
chronological Compass six idea flow.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:05.090
Identify how ideas progress from general
statements to specific details or from

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.220
a problem straight to its solution.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.720
The ultimate trick here is try
to create pairs of sentences

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.610
that logically follow each other.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.745
This is often the most effective
strategy to untangle the jumble.

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:21.125
Identify the concluding sentence.

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:25.895
This is like the grand finale
of a Diwali firework show.

00:09:26.405 --> 00:09:31.205
Look for sentences that summarize,
conclude, provide a solution

00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:33.155
or offer a final thought.

00:09:33.545 --> 00:09:38.405
These often contain words like
thus, therefore, in conclusion.

00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:44.225
Finally, as a result, the trick, a
concluding sentence, gives you a sense of

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:51.635
closure, a feeling that the discussion is
wrapped up neatly exam specific tricks.

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:56.190
Now, for some pro tips specifically
for your exam, my friend.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.280
Read all sentences first.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.840
Don't jump the gun.

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:05.939
Get a general understanding of the
topic and the main idea before you

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.980
even think about arranging them.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.730
It's like sizing up your
opponent before the Kush thi.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.400
Look for mandatory pairs.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.099
This is a super powerful shortcut.

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:22.740
Identify two sentences that must
go together like chai and samosa.

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:26.579
This significantly reduces the
number of possible arrangements.

00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:28.755
Eliminate options.

00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:32.895
If your question provides
multiple choice options, use them.

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:37.785
Once you form a pair or confidently
identify the opening or closing

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:42.314
sentence, immediately eliminate
options that don't match your findings.

00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:46.215
It's like using a cheat code
to narrow down the choices.

00:10:46.935 --> 00:10:50.355
General to specific, often paragraphs.

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:55.755
Start with a broad statement and then zoom
in on more specific details or examples.

00:10:56.265 --> 00:11:01.425
Identify the general statement as a
potential opening, and then look for

00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:03.585
the details that zoom in after it.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.330
Acronyms or abbreviations.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.770
If an acronym like NASA
is used, its full form.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.170
That is National Aeronautics and Space
Administration must have been introduced

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.630
in a preceding sentence, always.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:27.180
Article usage A or an versus the A noun
introduced with a or an indefinite article

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.300
usually appears before this very same noun
is referred to with the definite article.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.560
This is a subtle but powerful
clue, like a silent nod.

00:11:38.324 --> 00:11:43.454
And finally the age old wisdom,
practice, practice, practice.

00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:47.655
The more you practice, the better
you become at recognizing patterns

00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:49.785
and logical connections quickly.

00:11:50.115 --> 00:11:52.694
It's like hitting a fixer every time.

00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:54.074
Methods of solving.

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:57.030
All right, my friends.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:02.250
Solving para jumbles effectively
requires a systematic approach.

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.920
Just like planning a perfect road trip.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.819
Here's how you tackle these
problems step by step.

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:11.505
First, read, grasp the gist.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.220
Read all the given sentences carefully
without trying to arrange them yet.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.290
Your main goal here is to understand
the general topic, the theme,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.360
or the narrative of the passage.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.860
This initial read helps you get
a sense of the context, like

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.290
understanding the main plot of a movie.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.230
Identify the opening sentence.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.190
Now start looking for that
introductory sentence.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.190
It should be a general statement that
introduces the main idea, a person, a

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.800
concept, or a situation, and it shouldn't
refer to anything mentioned previously.

00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:55.385
Remember to eliminate sentences that
start with pronouns, conjunctions, or

00:12:55.385 --> 00:13:00.575
transition words if they don't have
a clear antecedent or preceding idea.

00:13:00.575 --> 00:13:05.945
Within the given set form, mandatory
pairs, this is a crucial step.

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:10.355
My friends look for sentences
that logically and grammatically

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:12.065
must follow each other.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.795
Use those clues we just discussed.

00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:16.435
Pronoun noun link.

00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:22.824
If one sentence mentions Dr. Sharma and
the next mentions he bingo, that's a pair.

00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:24.444
Transition words.

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:29.724
Therefore, however, consequently
in addition, moreover, for

00:13:29.724 --> 00:13:34.464
example, thus, finally, these
are your signals for connections.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:35.835
Cause and effect.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:40.215
One sentence describes a cause
and another describes its effect.

00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:41.715
Question and answer.

00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:46.875
If one sentence asks a question, look for
the sentence that provides the answer.

00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:49.005
Acronyms, abbreviations.

00:13:49.275 --> 00:13:51.375
The full form is introduced first.

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:56.625
Then it's acronym article
linkage A or N before the.

00:13:57.344 --> 00:13:59.594
Identify the concluding sentence.

00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:02.685
Look for the sentence
that wraps everything up.

00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:08.235
It summarizes the discussion, provides a
conclusion, or offered a final thought.

00:14:08.685 --> 00:14:12.194
These often have words like
in conclusion, finally.

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:16.585
As a result, therefore,
thus build the sequence.

00:14:16.944 --> 00:14:20.814
Once you have identified your
opening sentence and some mandatory

00:14:20.814 --> 00:14:25.015
pairs, start building the complete
sequence around these fixed points.

00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:27.175
Ensure a smooth flow of ideas.

00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:32.935
Each sentence should logically connect to
the one before it and the one after it.

00:14:33.115 --> 00:14:37.315
Like beads on a necklace, check
for chronological order, cause

00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:40.975
and effect relationships and
general to specific progressions.

00:14:41.365 --> 00:14:42.835
Verify the sequence.

00:14:43.135 --> 00:14:44.815
This is super important.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.805
After you've arranged all the
sentences, read the entire

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.785
paragraph from beginning to end.

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:52.255
Does it make sense?

00:14:52.555 --> 00:14:53.545
Is it coherent?

00:14:53.725 --> 00:14:55.195
Does it flow naturally?

00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:56.695
Like a good conversation?

00:14:57.065 --> 00:15:00.845
This final readthrough is
essential to catch any awkward

00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:03.125
transitions or logical gaps.

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.345
Use options if provided.

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:09.155
If the question gives you multiple
choice options for the sequence,

00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:11.165
use them to your advantage.

00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:16.115
Once you form a pair or identify the
opening sentence, eliminate options

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.675
that don't match your findings.

00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:22.475
This can significantly narrow down
the possibilities and save you time.

00:15:22.974 --> 00:15:28.165
Shortcuts and smart techniques
to maximize your efficiency and

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:32.875
accuracy In para jumbles, especially
under timed exam conditions.

00:15:33.175 --> 00:15:38.275
You need to employ some smart techniques
like a cricket captain setting the field.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.240
Look for opening and
closing sentences first.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:48.030
Often just identifying the very
first and very last sentences can

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.310
significantly narrow down your options.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.960
The opening sentence sets the stage
and the closing sentence provides

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.160
a neat summary or conclusion.

00:15:57.895 --> 00:15:59.875
Identify mandatory pairs.

00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:03.835
This is hands down, the
most powerful shortcut.

00:16:04.345 --> 00:16:08.515
Always look for two sentences
that simply must go together.

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:16.165
Common indicators include pronoun
anant, a pronoun like he she it, or

00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:21.115
they in one sentence, referring to a
specific noun in a previous sentence.

00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:26.715
Cause effect one sentence states a
cause and the next immediately states

00:16:26.715 --> 00:16:29.775
its effect like he ate too much.

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:30.885
As a result.

00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:33.705
He had a stomachache question, answer.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:37.660
A question is posed, and the very
next sentence provides the answer.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.949
Transition words, words like,
however, therefore, moreover, in

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:49.589
addition, consequently similarly,
for example, thus, finally are

00:16:49.589 --> 00:16:51.839
strong indicators of logical flow.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.130
Pay attention to them.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.910
Acronyms.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:59.680
The full form of an organization
or concept is usually introduced

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.600
before its acronym is used.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.960
Scan for chronological order or sequence.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.829
If the passage describes a
process, historical events,

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.510
or a sequence of actions.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.329
Look for time markers such as
first, then next, finally, later

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.890
in 1990, or subsequently, to
establish the correct order.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.079
General to specific flow.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.880
Many paragraphs often start with a
broad statement and then move on to

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.250
more specific details or examples.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.690
Identify that general statement
as a potential opening, and

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.500
then the specific details that
naturally follow article usage.

00:17:39.294 --> 00:17:45.564
Uh, or an versus the, a noun introduced
with an indefinite article, uh, or an

00:17:45.745 --> 00:17:50.365
usually appears before the same noun
is referred to with a definite article.

00:17:50.544 --> 00:17:53.544
The, this is a subtle but effective clue.

00:17:54.085 --> 00:17:56.004
Eliminate options strategically.

00:17:56.335 --> 00:17:59.605
If you get multiple choice
options, use them wisely.

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:04.825
Once you identify an opening sentence
or a mandatory pair, immediately

00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:08.754
eliminate all the options that
do not confirm to your findings.

00:18:09.085 --> 00:18:14.034
This can quickly reduce the number
of possibilities from BA to bus doin.

00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:19.105
Read the constructed paragraph after
you have arranged the sentences.

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:22.105
Make sure to read the
entire sequence once.

00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:23.784
Does it flow logically?

00:18:24.024 --> 00:18:25.645
Does it make complete sense?

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:30.955
This final read-through is vital to
catch any awkward transitions or errors

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:35.995
in your arrangement, like a final
quality check before delivery practice.

00:18:35.995 --> 00:18:39.655
With variety, don't just
stick to one type practice.

00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:41.080
Different kinds of para jumbles.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.980
Basic fixed sentence odd one out
to become familiar with various

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.170
patterns and develop your intuition.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.280
It's like mastering different
gullies in cricket, common

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.470
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.570
My friends, even with a solid
understanding of the rules, certain

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.190
mistakes and misconceptions,
then play spoil sport and hinder

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.290
your performance in para jumbles.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.389
Let's shine a light on them.

00:19:09.675 --> 00:19:16.245
Misconception, para jumbles are too
difficult and time consuming explanation.

00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:22.485
While they can certainly be challenging
like a complex roli design with systematic

00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:27.405
practice and the right application
of rules, para jumbles can actually

00:19:27.405 --> 00:19:29.804
become a very high scoring section.

00:19:30.284 --> 00:19:34.935
Many friends avoid them thinking
they're too tough, but mastering them

00:19:35.054 --> 00:19:37.695
gives you a definite edge over others.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.490
Don't run away from them.

00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:43.245
Mistake not reading all sentences.

00:19:43.245 --> 00:19:45.075
First explanation.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.205
This is a cardinal sin.

00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:52.665
Jumping directly into arrangement without
understanding the overall theme or

00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:55.575
context is like trying to cook a biani.

00:19:55.725 --> 00:19:58.095
Without knowing what ingredients you have.

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:01.155
It often leads to incorrect sequences.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.635
A quick first read helps
you grasp the main idea.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:10.820
Mistake, focusing only on the
first sentence Explanation.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:16.580
While identifying the opening sentence is
crucial, it's equally important to look

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:22.190
for logical connections and mandatory
pairs throughout the entire paragraph.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.840
A strong opening sentence doesn't
guarantee the rest of the sequence

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.880
will magically fall into place.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.850
You need to build the
bridge piece by piece.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:38.410
Mistake, ignoring transition words,
explanation, transition words like

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:43.540
however, therefore, moreover are like
traffic signals for logical flow.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.670
Overlooking them is like driving without
paying attention to signals, it can

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:54.190
lead to misinterpreting the relationship
between sentences and well a jumbled mess.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.120
Mistake, assuming chronological
order for all passages.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.710
Not all para jumbles follow a strict
chronological order, my friends.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.500
Some might present a problem and then
a solution or a general idea, followed

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.200
by examples or even a comparison.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.145
Be flexible in your approach.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.265
Not every story starts
with once upon a time.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.630
Mistake not verifying the final sequence.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.710
After you've arranged the
sentences, always read the complete

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.510
paragraph from beginning to end.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.250
Does it flow naturally?

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.260
Does it make perfect sense?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:36.780
An awkward transition or a logical jump
indicates an error in your arrangement.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.815
It's your final quality check.

00:21:39.855 --> 00:21:45.555
Mistake over reliance on options
without understanding logic explanation.

00:21:45.885 --> 00:21:50.445
While options are there to help
eliminate choices, don't blindly pick

00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:55.455
an option just because it starts with
a sentence you identified as an opener.

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:59.835
Always ensure the entire sequence
in the option is logically

00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:02.715
sound logic first option second.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.639
Misconception.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.070
Pronouns always refer to the
immediately preceding noun explanation.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.050
While this is often true, pronouns
can refer to nouns mentioned earlier

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.590
in the passage, not necessarily
the one right before them.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.840
Always trace the pronoun back to its
clearest and most logical antecedent.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.090
Don't be fooled by proximity.

00:22:26.505 --> 00:22:30.765
By being mindful of these common
pitfalls, you can definitely refine

00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:35.055
your approach and improve your success
rate in para jumbles, turning a

00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:37.365
challenge into a scoring opportunity.

00:22:38.205 --> 00:22:40.005
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:22:40.395 --> 00:22:44.985
All right, let's do a quick filmy recap
with our W Edge framework, shall we?

00:22:45.345 --> 00:22:49.425
This gives you a concise overview
of Para Jumbles, answering those

00:22:49.425 --> 00:22:54.375
fundamental questions in a crisp one
line format, like a quick newsflash.

00:22:54.764 --> 00:22:56.175
So what is it?

00:22:56.534 --> 00:23:01.635
It's rearranging jumble sentences to
form a coherent and logical paragraph.

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:03.014
Why do we do it?

00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:07.905
To test your logical reasoning, reading
comprehension, and your ability to

00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:10.665
identify contextual and grammar links.

00:23:10.995 --> 00:23:12.044
When is it applied?

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:16.845
It's typically applied in competitive
exams, like your exam to assess

00:23:16.905 --> 00:23:18.105
English language proficiency.

00:23:18.895 --> 00:23:23.365
Where is it found primarily in the
English language section of various

00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:25.105
banking and government exams.

00:23:25.345 --> 00:23:27.685
Who needs to master this exam?

00:23:27.685 --> 00:23:32.245
Candidates, editors, writers,
and absolutely anyone needing to

00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:34.225
organize information logically.

00:23:34.585 --> 00:23:35.905
And how do you crack it?

00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:40.405
By identifying, opening and closing
sentences, forming mandatory

00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:44.275
pairs, and recognizing logical
and grammatical connections.

00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:45.475
Simple, right.

00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:47.800
Fully worked out examples.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.389
Now for the main course, my
friends, here are some fully worked

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:56.740
out examples to illustrate the
process of solving para jumbles.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.530
Let's see these theories in action.

00:24:00.129 --> 00:24:04.960
Example, one question, rearrange
the following sentences.

00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:10.399
A, B, C, and D to form a
meaningful paragraph A.

00:24:10.879 --> 00:24:15.379
This has led to a significant
increase in online transactions.

00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:21.470
B, the advent of digital technology
has transformed various sectors.

00:24:21.949 --> 00:24:27.500
C. Consequently, cybersecurity
has become a paramount concern.

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:33.095
D one such sector is banking where
traditional methods are being

00:24:33.095 --> 00:24:35.254
replaced by digital platforms.

00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:45.425
Options one B, DAC two B, A
D, C, three DB, CA four CADB.

00:24:45.965 --> 00:24:50.524
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:57.230
Step one, identify the opening
sentence, sentence B. The advent of

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.450
digital technology has transformed
various sectors, introduces a general

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.659
topic and can stand alone like a boss.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.600
Isn't it sentences A and C
start with transition words.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.310
This has led to and consequently,
which clearly indicate

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.020
they follow something else.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.660
And sentence D starts with one such
sector implying that various sectors

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.580
must have been mentioned before.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.690
So clearly B is our perfect opening act.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:33.250
Step two, form mandatory
pairs or logical connections.

00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:36.995
Sentence D one Such sector is banking.

00:25:37.145 --> 00:25:41.075
Where traditional methods are
being replaced by digital platforms

00:25:41.315 --> 00:25:45.935
directly follows B by giving
a concrete example of a sector

00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:48.095
transformed by digital technology.

00:25:48.245 --> 00:25:49.325

00:25:49.735 --> 00:25:55.044
Then sentence A. This has led to
a significant increase in online

00:25:55.044 --> 00:26:00.024
transactions, logically follows D,
because the transformation in banking

00:26:00.264 --> 00:26:04.975
moving to digital platforms directly
leads to more online transactions.

00:26:05.185 --> 00:26:06.804
It's a natural progression.

00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:11.685
And finally sentence C.
