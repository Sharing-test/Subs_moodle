Welcome my friend to today's lecture
On sentence starters, let's unpack

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.750
the mystery of this concept without
needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.084 --> 00:00:12.584
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.315
So what are these sentence starters?

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:15.765
Array?

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:16.634
It's simple.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.595
They are questions designed to
test your ability to connect

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.215
different parts of a sentence.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:27.195
Logically and grammatically, you are
given a starting phrase, the starter,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.535
and several other sentence fragments.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:35.055
Your job is to identify which fragment
correctly, follows the starter to form

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.754
a single coherent and sound sentence.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.140
The key is to understand the relationship,
like cause, effect, contrast, or a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.839
condition that the starter establishes.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.160
That's the secret sauce.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
Real world relevance and don't
think this is just for your exam.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.900
Mastering sentence structure helps you
draft clear and logical communications

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.660
a superpower in any professional role.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.400
It ensures your written work is
persuasive and easy to understand.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.800
Imagine writing clear emails to
convey your point without any

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.230
ambiguity or preparing reports.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680
By structuring findings
logically for better impact.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.390
You can use it when drafting proposals
to create persuasive arguments

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.520
by connecting ideas coherently.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:26.065
For client communication,
it ensures messages are

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.985
professional and easy to follow.

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:33.024
Even when recording meeting minutes, you
can capture discussions and action items

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.274
in a structured, understandable way.

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:40.764
Or when doing a policy explanation, you
can break down complex rules into simple

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:42.865
connected sentences for colleagues.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.540
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.710
Now, based on what we see in
exams, these questions typically

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.270
appear in a few formats.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.790
The most frequent type with a frequency
of about 60% is a single starter.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.500
With multiple clauses, you are given
one starting phrase and three or four

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.090
clauses, and you must determine which
clause can correctly follow the starter.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.610
Another common format making up about
30% is connecting two sentences.

00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:16.805
You get two separate complete sentences
and a list of starter words, like

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:21.545
although or because, and you have to
choose the starter that best combines

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:23.555
them into one logical sentence.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:29.225
The less common variation at about 10%
frequency gives you multiple starters with

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:34.085
one clause where you must pick the starter
that correctly introduces that clause.

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:36.315
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:41.385
While there are no strict formulas, these
rules and tricks are absolutely vital.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.805
First, you must identify
the starters function.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:46.515
Understand what it does.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:51.915
Does it show contrast, like although
or despite a condition like if or

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:56.390
unless a reason with because or
since, or time with when or after.

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:59.575
Second check for tense consistency.

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:03.775
The tense of the clause that follows
must be consistent with the starter.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:08.785
Also, ensure subject verb agreement is
correct when the clauses are joined.

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:12.445
Most importantly, there must
be a logical connection.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:16.345
Don't just look for grammar,
look for coherence, and

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.385
finally punctuation awareness.

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:22.225
Pay attention to commerce as a
starter phrase is often followed

00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:24.175
by one, which gives you a clue.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:29.100
Methods of solving follow this
step-by-step method to solve

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.600
these questions effectively.

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.310
First, read the starter phrase,
carefully analyze it to understand

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.730
its meaning and the type of
logical relationship it implies.

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.459
Next, read each subsequent clause.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.154
Go through each of the
given fragments one by one.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.670
Then mentally connect the starter
to each clause and check if the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.600
combined sentence is grammatically
correct and logically meaningful.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.010
Check for grammatical errors,
like issues with tense subject, VE

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.440
agreement, or incorrect pronoun usage.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.230
Ask yourself, does this make sense?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.600
The sentence must have a clear meaning.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.070
Repeat this process for all clauses,
and then select the option that

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.030
lists all the clauses that correctly
and logically follow the starter.

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.899
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.339
Here are some techniques to
increase your speed and accuracy.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.969
Focus on conjunctions words like,
but, and so because a powerful

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:32.190
clues, if the starter is, although
he is rich, the following clause

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.530
will likely contain a contrast.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.530
You can also use elimination
by contradiction.

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:43.195
Quickly eliminate any clause that
logically contradicts the starter.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:49.345
For example, if the starter is, unless
you study heart a clause, like you

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:53.980
will surely top the exam is a direct
contradiction and can be discarded.

00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:58.585
Also try positive slash
negative tone matching.

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:03.295
If the starter has a positive tone,
the connecting clause should align

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:08.335
with it unless the starter itself
indicates a contrast like despite.

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:12.164
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.825
Avoid these frequent errors
to improve your score.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:21.255
A very common mistake is ignoring
the starters, meaning focusing only

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:25.815
on grammar and failing to see that
the combined sentence is illogical.

00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:28.815
Another is mismatching tenses.

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:34.595
Combining a past tense starter with a
present tense clause incorrectly, do not

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:40.595
try forcing a connection just because a
clause seems related to the topic, even if

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:43.265
the grammatical or logical link is flawed.

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.690
And please avoid partial reading.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:47.435
Only.

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:49.985
The beginning of each
clause is a bad habit.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.865
The error is often hiding at the end.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:56.645
Finally, don't suffer from
punctuation, blindness.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.820
Ignoring the role of can change the
meaning and correctness of a sentence.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.650
WH framework summary.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.710
So here's a quick summary for you, friend.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.360
What is this topic?

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.620
It's a question type that tests
your ability to join a starting

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.420
phrase with a suitable clause.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.400
Why is it important to assess your
understanding of sentence structure?

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.495
Grammar and logical reasoning.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:24.295
When do we use this?

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:28.945
When you need to form a single
complex sentence from multiple parts.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:33.055
Where is it found in many
competitive exams and it's

00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:35.155
essential for professional writing.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:36.655
Who is this for?

00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:39.955
Anyone aiming to demonstrate
proficiency in English for

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.090
exams or professional roles?

00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:44.565
And how do you solve it?

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:49.395
By analyzing the starters function
and checking each following clause for

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:51.914
grammatical and logical compatibility.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.420
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.220
Example, one question unless
you have a clear plan.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.210
One, you are likely to
waste time and resources.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.960
Two.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.140
The project was successfully
completed ahead of schedule.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:08.445
Three.

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:12.165
Achieving your goals become
significantly more difficult.

00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:20.055
Options A only one B, only
three C. Both one and 3D.

00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:21.915
Both two and three.

00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:25.455
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:28.005
All right, let's analyze this.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.090
The starter, unless you have a clear
plan, sets up a negative condition.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.370
It means if you do not have a clear
plan, the clause that follows should

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.100
describe a negative consequence clause.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.430
One.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.390
You are likely to waste time
and resources is a negative

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.220
consequence and fits perfectly.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.310
Clause two.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.300
The project was successfully
completed is a positive outcome

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.560
which contradicts the negative
conditions set by unless it's out.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.640
Clause three, achieving your
goals become significantly more

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.780
difficult is another negative
consequence that logically follows.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.480
So both one and three work.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.690
The correct answer is C, example two.

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:11.989
Question.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:16.400
Having submitted the application
one, the next step is to

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.960
wait for the interview call.

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:18.710
Two.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.739
The documents were not
verified by the manager.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.489
Three.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.669
He felt a sense of relief
and accomplishment.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.370
Options A only one.

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:33.140
B, only three C. Both one and 2D.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.760
Both one and three.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.240
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.229
Let's break this one down.

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:45.060
The starter, having submitted the
application is a participant phrase.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.280
It describes an action completed by a
subject, the main clause that follows.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.969
Must have the same subject
who submitted the application?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:54.989
A person.

00:08:55.349 --> 00:08:56.729
Now look at clause one.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.140
The subject is the next
step, not a person.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.490
This is a dangling modifier
and is incorrect in clause two.

00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:06.829
The subject is the documents.

00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:09.589
The documents did not
submit the application.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.310
This is also a dangling
modifier in clause three.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.730
The subject is he, this works perfectly.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.030
He submitted the application
and he felt relief.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.060
The sentence is grammatically
correct and logical.

00:09:23.415 --> 00:09:27.165
Therefore only three is
correct, making B the answer.

00:09:27.675 --> 00:09:29.535
Example Three question.

00:09:29.925 --> 00:09:34.515
Although the team faced numerous
setbacks, one, but they managed

00:09:34.515 --> 00:09:36.225
to finish the project on time.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:39.075
Two, they never lost their motivation.

00:09:39.405 --> 00:09:42.825
Three, because their morale
was consistently high.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:43.870
Options.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.050
A only two B, only one C. Both one and 2D.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.970
All one, two, and three.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.360
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.260
Okay.

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:57.760
Let's look at the starter.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.630
Although is a conjunction
that introduces a contrast.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.740
The starter describes a negative
situation, setbacks, so the

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.310
following clause should present
a contrasting positive outcome

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.130
clause one uses, but they managed.

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:16.829
Using both although and but to
show the same contrast is redundant

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:18.359
and grammatically incorrect.

00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:21.689
This is a double conjunction
error clause two.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.760
They never lost their motivation.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:27.390
Presents a positive state that
contrasts with the setbacks.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.699
The sentence is correct and logical.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.010
Clause three uses because which
introduces a reason, not a contrast.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.870
It does not logically follow.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.010
Although so only clause two
correctly completes the sentence.

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:43.735
The answer is a thank you.

00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:45.190
See you in the next lecture.
