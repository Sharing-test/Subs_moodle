Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on error spotting.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.780
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.780
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.530
All right, so what
exactly is error spotting?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.360
Well, it's a super important part
of the English language section in

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.040
various competitive examinations.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.480
Especially your exam.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.860
Basically, they give you a
sentence, usually broken into

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.379
a few parts, say four or five.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.170
Your main job is to play detective and
find the part that has a grammatical,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.110
goof up, a spelling hiccup, a wrong word
choice, or any other linguistic blunder

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.364
if the sentence is clean as a whistle.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.035
No errors at all.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.735
Then you just pick the no error option.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.964
Simple right to truly ace
error spotting my friends.

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:58.474
You need to have your grammar
fundamentals rock solid.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:02.435
This means you should know your
parts of speech inside out.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:06.725
Nouns, pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, adverbs.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.070
Prepositions Conjunctions, interjections
Plus Master Your Tenses, subject Verb

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.380
agreement, articles, prepositions,
conditionals, parallelism, and those

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.810
tricky common idiomatic expressions.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.240
The errors you see are often quite
subtle, designed to test your nuanced

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.785
understanding of English rules.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:32.595
It's not just about pointing
out a mistake, but also knowing

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:36.135
why it's a mistake and what
the correct way should be.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:41.415
It's like knowing the why behind why your
mom always tells you to clean your room.

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:46.785
This section, my dear friends, aims to
equip you with the fundamental knowledge

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:52.215
and analytical skills needed to pinpoint
errors accurately and efficiently.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.045
We are going to break down the.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.860
Common types of errors you'll encounter
in these exams and provide clear,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.960
concise explanations to help you grasp
those underlying grammatical principles.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.320
So, buckle up, real world relevance.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.630
Now, why is understanding and
spotting errors in language so vital

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.735
even beyond just passing exams?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Well imagine an officer that's you in the
future, hopefully dealing with official

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.440
documents and public interactions.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.120
Clarity in communication is like
the secret ingredient for success.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.380
Think about it.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.180
Clarity in communication ensures
precise understanding in official

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.490
correspondence and verbal interactions.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.540
No room for.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.085
What did they mean by that?

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:45.175
Here, professional credibility reflects
attention to detail and professionalism.

00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:50.065
In all your written and spoken exchanges,
you don't want to look like you just woke

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.645
up and decided to write a document, right?

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.220
Accurate documentation prevents
misinterpretation in legal

00:02:57.445 --> 00:02:58.825
and financial documents.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.665
One, misplaced comma can
cost millions, literally.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.400
Effective reporting enables
concise and error-free reports for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.560
internal and external stakeholders.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.970
Nobody wants to read a report that
looks like a tangled mess of wires.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.440
Public relations maintains a
positive image of the institution

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.510
through flawless public statements.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.870
You want to impress, not depress policy.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.280
Interpretation is crucial for
correctly understanding and applying

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.500
complex policies and regulations.

00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.055
Misunderstand a policy and poof.

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:39.265
Trouble breakdown of question types based
on our deep dive into past exam patterns

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.815
in your exam and similar examinations.

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:46.015
The recurring question formats in
error spotting, mostly focus on

00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:50.905
various grammatical concepts while
the exact percentages might swing a

00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:55.225
bit year to year, the general lineup
usually looks something like this.

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:58.600
Subject verb agreement
takes a good chunk about.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.959
20 to 25% of the pie.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.700
These are errors where the verb just
isn't agreeing with its subject in

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.720
number, like a singular subject,
trying to dance with a plural verb.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.160
Tenses are old friends
account for 15 to 20%.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.779
These are mistakes in using the
right verb tenses, past, present,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.089
future, perfect continuous forms.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.034
It's like mixing up your timelines.

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:30.705
Prepositions snag about 10 to 15% think
incorrect use of on in at four with,

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:36.105
or even missing one, where it should
be they are small but mighty articles.

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:42.705
Those tiny A and and the also grab
10 to 15% errors here are about using

00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:46.395
definite the and indefinite a and wrongly.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.100
Parts of speech, specifically adjectives
and adverbs contribute 10 to 15%.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.760
This is where you misuse an
adjective instead of an adverb

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.770
or miss up comparative forms.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.410
It's about knowing who modifies whom
pronouns sneak in with five to 10%

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.780
errors in pronoun agreement number,
gender case, or when a pronoun

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.550
reference is just too confusing.

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:16.479
Conjunctions the sentence connectors
get five to 10% incorrect use of and,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.869
but or nor either or neither nor or
parallelism issues parallelism itself

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:27.400
where sentences lack parallel structure
enlists or comparisons accounts for

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.280
five to 7% conditional sentences.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:34.270
Those if then statements
make up three to 5% errors in

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.679
their structure can be tricky.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.460
And then we have miscellaneous
issues about five to 10%.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.190
Covering errors related to idiomatic
expressions, phrasal verbs, or just

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.500
plain unnecessary repetition of words.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.040
This breakdown, my friends
clearly shows you where to put

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.630
your focus during preparation.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.710
A strong grip on these grammatical
concepts will seriously boost

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.450
your accuracy in error spotting.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.150
Trust me, it's like having a map to a
hidden treasure formulas and tricks.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.850
Now don't expect actual mathematical
formulas for error spotting.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.200
We're not doing calculus here,
but we do have key grammatical

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.430
rules and some quick tricks that
act as your guiding principles.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.620
Memorizing these will seriously speed
up your error identification process.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.140
It's like having cheat codes for the game.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.750
Let's talk about the
key grammatical rules.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.550
These are your formulas,
subject verb agreement, SVA.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.130
This is fundamental singular.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.110
Subject means a singular verb.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.550
For example, he runs or
the dog barks, plural.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.590
Subject means a plural verb
like they run, or the dogs bark.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.690
Trick, always identify the
true subject, ignore all those

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.429
pesky intervening phrases.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.340
For instance, in one of the boys is
here, one is the subject, not boys.

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:00.690
So it's is.

00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:07.575
Parallelism items in a list or comparison
must be in the same grammatical form.

00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:13.365
For example, he likes to swim,
to run and to cycle, or he likes

00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:15.525
swimming, running, and cycling.

00:07:15.795 --> 00:07:18.465
You can't mix and match
like a fashion disaster.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:24.165
Trick look for conjunctions like
and or, but connecting elements.

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:25.695
They demand balance.

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:30.585
Pronoun agreement pronouns must
agree with their antecedents

00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:33.195
in number, gender and person.

00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:38.355
For instance, each friend must
bring his or her own book trick.

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:43.065
Check if the pronoun clearly refers
to a specific noun and matches it.

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:45.660
No identity crisis for pronouns, please.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.810
Tense consistency.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.670
Maintain a consistent tense throughout
a sentence or paragraph unless

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.040
there's a super clear reason to shift.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.820
Trick.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.490
Look for time indicators like yesterday.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.260
Now, next week, ensure your verbs
are playing along with the timeline.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.630
Adjective versus adverb.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.790
Adjectives modify nouns or
pronouns like he is a good singer.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.980
Adverbs, on the other hand, modify
verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.810
For example, he sings well
Trick if it describes an action.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.860
It's usually an adverb, and
many times it'll end in ly.

00:08:26.034 --> 00:08:30.174
Prepositional usage specific
prepositions are used with certain

00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:32.304
words or in specific contexts.

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:38.245
For example, you agree with a person,
but you agree to a proposal trick.

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:42.505
Pay attention to common phrasal verbs
and fixed prepositional phrases.

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.305
They are like set pairs.

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:46.015
You can't just break them up.

00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:52.285
Articles A and the A or an for
indefinite, singular countable nouns.

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.775
Remember, an is for vowel sounds.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.010
The is for specific or
already mentioned nouns.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.090
Trick check if the noun is
specific or general, and if

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.010
it's countable or uncountable.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.260
Now, for some exam specific tricks,
because we want to be smart, not just

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.080
study us, read the entire sentence.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.260
Don't just stop at the first
potential error you spot.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.250
Sometimes an error in one
part is explained or even

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.870
required by another part.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.470
It's like finding half a clue
and jumping to conclusions.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.240
Look for common traps.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.689
Examiners love to test
frequently confused words.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.939
Think, effect versus effect.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.250
Lie versus lay, than versus.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.829
Then these are like their favorite snares.

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:38.660
Eliminate no error.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.089
Last, always assume there's an error
only, and I mean only select no

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:47.959
error if you are absolutely hundred
percent certain After checking.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.950
Every single part, focus
on grammatical structure.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.580
Mentally break down the sentence
into clauses and phrases.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.940
Check their internal
consistency and how they relate.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.230
It's like dismantling a complex
machine to find the loose screw.

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:05.585
Trust your ear with caution.

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:09.455
While a sentence might sound
wrong, always back it up with

00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:10.985
a specific grammatical rule.

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:15.425
Your ear can be a good initial
hint, but it's not the final judge.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:18.995
Your ear can play tricks on
you just like that uncle who

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:20.675
always says he'll pay you back.

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:22.625
Methods of solving.

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:27.775
Solving error, spotting questions
systematically, my friends can

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.965
seriously boost your accuracy.

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:35.095
Here are some distinct approaches
to tackle these problems like a pro.

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.605
First up, read the sentence carefully.

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:39.865
First pass.

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:45.950
Start by reading the entire sentence once,
just get the overall meaning and flow.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.350
This initial read helps you spot
any glaring errors or awkward

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.540
framing that immediately jumps out.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.880
Pay close attention to the context
and what the sentence is trying to say

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.110
Next segment and analyze Second pass.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:09.199
Part by part now mentally, or if
you are allowed physically, break

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:14.870
down the sentence into its marked
parts, A, B, C, D, and so on.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.130
Examine each part individually
for potential errors.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.420
This involves a checklist,
subject word agreement.

00:11:23.814 --> 00:11:25.015
Does the word match?

00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:29.665
Its subject in number, like are
they singing in tune, tense?

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:30.535
Consistency?

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:34.975
Is the tense used correctly and
consistently throughout the sentence?

00:11:35.365 --> 00:11:39.564
No time travel without a reason,
please, pronoun agreement.

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:44.905
Do those pronouns agree with their
antecedents in number, gender and case?

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.755
Are they wearing the
right matching outfits?

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:51.625
Articles and prepositions
are the correct articles.

00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:57.895
A and the and prepositions used these
little words can make a big difference.

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:02.485
Adjectives and adverbs are
they used correctly to modify

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.555
nouns, pronouns and verbs.

00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:06.565
Adjectives, adverbs, respectively.

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:09.055
Is everyone doing their job right?

00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:13.135
Conjunctions are coordinating
and subordinating.

00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:17.005
Conjunctions used correctly to
connect clauses and phrases.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.335
Are they building bridges properly?

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:25.005
Parallelism are elements in a series
or comparison grammatically parallel,

00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:28.485
no lopsided structures, word usage.

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:33.495
Are there any commonly confused
words like effect and effect, or.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.460
Principle and principle used incorrectly.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.800
Don't fall for these classic traps.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.290
Then identify the core error.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.920
Once you spot a potential
error, confirm it.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.430
Recall the specific grammatical
rule it's violating.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.850
Don't just go by what sounds
right or sounds wrong.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.120
Always pinpoint the
grammatical rule being broken.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.485
If you find more than one potential
error, prioritize the most

00:12:59.515 --> 00:13:00.965
fundamental grammatical error.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:05.485
For example, subject word
agreement often takes precedence

00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:07.314
over subtle word choice issues.

00:13:07.645 --> 00:13:10.074
It's like finding the
biggest crack in the wall.

00:13:10.074 --> 00:13:13.555
First, consider alternatives
and corrections.

00:13:13.944 --> 00:13:17.969
Mentally rephrase the erroneous part
with the correct grammatical structure.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.010
This helps confirm your
error identification.

00:13:21.775 --> 00:13:26.695
If you just can't find a clear error,
reread the sentence this time, focusing

00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:28.645
on different grammatical aspects.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.685
Finally, final review.

00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:31.495
No error.

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:31.945
Check.

00:13:32.365 --> 00:13:37.465
If after a super thorough analysis
of all parts you truly can't find

00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:42.835
any grammatical error, then and only
then consider the no error option.

00:13:43.165 --> 00:13:47.605
This should be your last resort
because let's be honest, most questions

00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:48.835
are designed to have an error.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.950
They don't just put no
error there for fun.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.750
Now for different question formats,
if the sentence is divided into

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.770
parts, use the segment by segment
analysis we just discussed.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.220
Pay extra attention to the
transitions between parts.

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:07.314
For sentence improvement
or correction questions.

00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:10.495
First, identify the error
in the original sentence.

00:14:10.795 --> 00:14:15.444
Then look for the option that corrects
it perfectly while keeping the original

00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:17.635
meaning and grammar intact for.

00:14:17.635 --> 00:14:21.235
Fill in the blanks, grammar
based, analyze the context of the

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:24.625
blank and the surrounding words
to figure out the required part

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.814
of speech tense or agreement.

00:14:27.204 --> 00:14:31.255
Then pick the option that fits both
grammatically and contextually.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.800
Remember my friends.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.670
Consistent practice with these
methods will build your intuition

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.439
and speed In identifying errors,
you'll become error spotting ninjas,

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.960
shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.670
All right, my friends, to really
optimize your performance under

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.590
exam time pressure, let's talk about
some smart techniques and shortcuts.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.610
It's all about working
smarter, not just harder.

00:14:58.305 --> 00:15:01.604
First scan for obvious agreement issues.

00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:05.444
First, quickly check for
subject verb agreement and

00:15:05.444 --> 00:15:07.305
pronoun antecedent agreement.

00:15:07.755 --> 00:15:13.365
These errors are super common and often
easy to spot, like a bright red flag.

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:16.635
Example, the team are celebrating.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.830
Error here.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.290
Team is singular when acting as
a unit, so it should be is next.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.420
Look for prepositional phrases.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.480
Errors often hide in these little guys.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.930
If a preposition seems
a bit off, question it.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.580
Many verbs and nouns love to hang
out with specific prepositions.

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:39.850
Example, he is good in mathematics.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.760
Error should be at mathematics.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.660
We are good at.

00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:48.834
Add something not in it unless you are
literally swimming in math equations.

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:51.925
Always check for parallelism in lists.

00:15:52.314 --> 00:15:57.834
When you see a list like A, B, and
C, make sure all items are wearing

00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.724
the same grammatical uniform.

00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:02.875
All nouns, all verbs in the same tense.

00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:06.084
All gers, you get the drift example.

00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:12.025
She likes to sing, dancing, and
to paint error inconsistent forms.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:18.810
It should be to sing, to dance, and to
paint or singing, dancing and painting.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.270
Verify tense, consistency.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.020
Read through the sentence,
specifically checking the verbs.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.210
Does the timeline make sense?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.120
Are there any unnecessary jumps and tense?

00:16:30.425 --> 00:16:32.915
It's like time traveling without a permit.

00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:37.204
Example, he went to the
market and buys some fruits.

00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:37.745
Error.

00:16:38.135 --> 00:16:40.685
When is past buys is present.

00:16:41.015 --> 00:16:42.905
Pick a timeline and stick to it.

00:16:43.385 --> 00:16:45.725
Identify adjective or adverb.

00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:45.755
Mixups.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:50.175
If a word is describing a
verb, it should generally be

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.665
an adverb, often ending in LY.

00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:55.724
If it's describing a
noun, it's an adjective.

00:16:55.844 --> 00:17:01.395
Simple example, she sings
Good error should be well.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:06.464
Well, is the adverb modifying sings
unless she is a good singer, in which

00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:09.135
case good is an adjective for singer.

00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:11.355
Focus on conjunctions.

00:17:11.714 --> 00:17:14.925
Pay special attention to those
correlative conjunctions.

00:17:15.294 --> 00:17:20.784
Either or neither nor not only,
but also they demand parallel

00:17:20.784 --> 00:17:22.165
structures following them.

00:17:22.464 --> 00:17:27.175
Example, he is not only
intelligent, but also a good singer.

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:28.584
This one's correct.

00:17:28.824 --> 00:17:30.594
Intelligent is an adjective.

00:17:30.774 --> 00:17:33.205
A good singer is a noun phrase here.

00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:37.764
They function parallel as
descriptions of he the no error trap.

00:17:38.034 --> 00:17:43.044
Don't be scared to choose no error, but
make it your very last consideration.

00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:48.415
Only select it if you've really, really
checked every part and every rule.

00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:53.965
It's like finding a needle in a haystack,
but sometimes the needle just isn't there.

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:56.275
Try reading backwards mentally.

00:17:56.635 --> 00:18:01.015
Sometimes reading the sentence from
end to beginning can help you catch

00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:03.265
errors you missed during a forward read.

00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:07.585
It breaks the natural flow and
forces your brain to focus on

00:18:07.585 --> 00:18:09.475
individual words and phrases.

00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:12.295
A bit like seeing things
from a different angle.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.420
Isolate clauses for those
long complex sentences.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.110
Mentally separate the independent
and dependent clauses.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.940
Check each clause for internal grammatical
correctness, and then ensure they are

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:30.040
correctly joined, like taking apart a
complicated toy and checking each piece.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.880
And finally, practice
with timers regularly.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.835
Practice error spotting
questions under timed conditions.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.470
This will improve both
your speed and accuracy.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.940
It helps internalize the common
error patterns so you can spot them

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.310
faster than a bank robber in a vault.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.190
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.360
Even seasoned candidates, my
friends, fall prey to certain

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.520
common errors and misconceptions.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.620
Being aware of these can
help you dodge those bullets.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:07.070
First, the misconception, if it
sounds right, it's right explanation.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.840
Our spoken language, especially
in informal settings, often

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.680
takes shortcuts and deviates
from strict grammatical rules.

00:19:16.035 --> 00:19:21.795
Many phrases that sound perfectly fine in
casual chat are grammatically incorrect.

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:27.015
Always, always rely on grammatical
rules, not just your ear.

00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:29.745
Your ear can be a deceptive friend.

00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:34.095
Mistake ignoring the
subject in long sentences.

00:19:34.544 --> 00:19:39.405
Explanation in complex sentences
with lots of intervening phrases.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:43.065
It's super easy to lose
track of the actual subject.

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:46.335
This leads straight to
subject verb agreement errors.

00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:53.385
Always, always identify the main
subject, first example, the list of

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:58.185
items, including the rare artifacts
and ancient scrolls were stolen.

00:19:58.514 --> 00:19:58.965
Error.

00:19:59.205 --> 00:20:04.185
The subject here is list, which is
singular, so it should be was stolen.

00:20:04.364 --> 00:20:09.824
The stuff in between is just extra
luggage mistake, confusing, homophones,

00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:15.405
and easily confused words, explanation,
words that sound alike, but have.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.140
Different meanings, homophones
or words that are frequently

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.900
interchanged, like effect or effect.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.810
Lose or lose than, or then it's,
or it's there or there, or there

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.820
are common sources of error.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:35.850
Example, the effect of the medicine
was immediate error should be effect.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.600
Effect is usually a noun
effect is usually a verb.

00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:41.385
Misconception.

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:43.875
All collective nouns are singular.

00:20:44.145 --> 00:20:45.045
Explanation.

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:50.745
Collective nouns like team, family
committee can be singular or plural.

00:20:51.075 --> 00:20:56.505
It depends on whether the members are
acting as a single unit or as individuals.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:59.535
If they're acting individually,
they take a plural, VE.

00:21:00.455 --> 00:21:06.095
Example, the team are debating among
themselves, this is correct, as it implies

00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:11.075
the individual members of the team are
debating not the team as a single entity.

00:21:11.435 --> 00:21:12.095
Mistake.

00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:17.825
Incorrect use of articles with uncountable
nouns, explanation, uncountable

00:21:17.825 --> 00:21:20.465
nouns such as information advise.

00:21:20.555 --> 00:21:26.855
Furniture news, do not take indefinite
articles, a and and generally are not.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:32.225
Pluralized example, he gave me
an advice error, should be some

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:34.565
advice or a piece of advice.

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:38.735
You can't count advice like
you count apples, mistake,

00:21:38.975 --> 00:21:41.315
redundancy, or superfluous words.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.370
Explanation.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.510
This is about using more words
than necessary to convey meaning.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.490
It often pops up in phrases
like return back, repeat again.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.750
Final outcome.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.870
Example, he returned back to his home.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.120
Error back is redundant.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.060
If you return, you are
already coming back.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.380
Misconception, more than one
always takes a plural verb.

00:22:05.665 --> 00:22:06.534
Explanation.

00:22:06.774 --> 00:22:07.405
Nope.

00:22:07.465 --> 00:22:12.115
More than one is actually followed by
a singular noun and a singular verb.

00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:13.105
It's tricky.

00:22:13.105 --> 00:22:13.675
I know.

00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:17.185
Example, more than one friend was absent.

00:22:17.365 --> 00:22:18.355
This is correct.

00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.379
Mistake dangling modifiers.

00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:22.004
Explanation.

00:22:22.304 --> 00:22:25.935
A modifier, which is a word or
phrase that describes another

00:22:25.935 --> 00:22:27.824
word or phrase, is dangling.

00:22:27.975 --> 00:22:31.935
If it's not clearly or logically
attached to the word it's supposed

00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:35.774
to modify, it's like leaving
your car keys, hanging in midair.

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:39.885
Example, walking down the
street, the trees were beautiful.

00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:40.544
Error.

00:22:40.784 --> 00:22:42.794
This implies that trees were walking.

00:22:43.034 --> 00:22:47.564
It should be something like walking
down the street, I saw beautiful trees.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.550
By being super vigilant about these
common pitfalls, my friends, you can

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.740
significantly reduce your error rate.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.440
It's like learning
where the landmines are.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.660
W Edge framework summary.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.220
Let's quickly summarize error spotting
with our Trustee W Edge framework.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.550
Think of it as the quick
recap before the break.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.860
So what is error spotting?

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.200
It's identifying grammatical, syntactical,
or lexical errors in sentences.

00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:16.765
Why do we do it?

00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:20.995
To ensure clear, correct, and
effective communication, which is

00:23:20.995 --> 00:23:24.985
absolutely crucial for professional
roles and competitive exams.

00:23:25.285 --> 00:23:30.025
When is it applied During language
proficiency tests, editing, proofreading,

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.425
and any form of formal communication.

00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:34.995
Where is it found in the English language?

00:23:34.995 --> 00:23:39.284
Sections of competitive exams,
like your exam, and in all forms of

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:41.235
written and spoken communication.

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.615
Who needs to know this?

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:43.365
Exam?

00:23:43.365 --> 00:23:48.524
Candidates, writers, editors, and anyone
who aims for precise language use.

00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:49.635
How do we do it?

00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:53.895
By applying grammatical rules,
analyzing sentence structure, and

00:23:53.895 --> 00:23:55.995
recognizing common error patterns.

00:23:56.115 --> 00:23:57.735
Simple yet powerful.

00:23:58.155 --> 00:24:00.105
Fully worked out examples.

00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:04.545
All right, my friends, let's get
down to business with some fully

00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:09.525
worked out examples to show you how
this error spotting magic happens.

00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:16.695
Example, one question, identify the part
of the sentence that contains an error.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:25.610
A manager told the B employees
that C, every one of them were

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.810
expected 2D on time options.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:37.400
A manager told B employees that C,
every one of them were D on time.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.050
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:45.645
Solution, step one.

00:24:46.004 --> 00:24:49.785
Let's analyze this sentence
for subject verb agreement.

00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:55.605
The subject of the clause, every one
of them were expected is everyone.

00:24:56.055 --> 00:24:59.625
The phrase of them is just
a prepositional phrase.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.700
It doesn't mess with the subject's number.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:08.730
Everyone is an indefinite pronoun
and it's always singular, no

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.100
matter how many people are in them.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.230
Step two, now, check the verb
associated with our subject.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:21.630
The verb used is were expected
and were is a plural verb.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.560
Uh oh.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.030
We have a mismatch.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.170
Step three.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.470
So the mismatch is clear since.

00:25:28.675 --> 00:25:30.235
Everyone is singular.

00:25:30.385 --> 00:25:33.415
It absolutely requires a singular verb.

00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:36.565
The plural verb war is incorrect.

00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:39.265
Step four, what's the correct form?

00:25:39.265 --> 00:25:39.505
Then?

00:25:39.925 --> 00:25:44.035
The singular form of
war is, was step five.

00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:49.615
Therefore, the error lies squarely
in part C because every one of

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:51.685
them were, should correctly be.

00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:53.260
Every one of them was.

00:25:54.014 --> 00:25:55.095
Correct sentence.

00:25:55.395 --> 00:26:00.044
The manager told the employees
that every one of them was expected

00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:02.294
to attend the meeting on time.

00:26:02.774 --> 00:26:08.745
Example, two question identified the part
of the sentence that contains an error.

00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:09.794
She.

00:26:10.105 --> 00:26:18.685
A is more smarter than B. Any other
friend in C, her class excelling in D,

00:26:18.865 --> 00:26:23.365
all subjects options A, is more smarter.

00:26:23.635 --> 00:26:30.805
B, any other friend C, her class D,
all subjects understand the question

00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:32.520
before moving to explanation.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.860
Solution.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.660
Step one, let's examine the
comparative adjective usage Here.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.220
The word smarter is already
a comparative adjective.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.030
It's formed by simply adding ER to smart.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:54.450
Now, the word more is used to form the
comparative degree of longer adjectives,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.110
like more beautiful or more intelligent.

00:26:58.485 --> 00:26:59.205
Step two.

00:26:59.475 --> 00:27:01.605
So what's the redundancy?

00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:06.735
Using both more and smarter together
creates a double comparative.

00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:11.085
This is grammatically incorrect
and totally redundant.

00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:15.855
It's like saying more dollar,
you just don't Step three.

00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:17.445
What's the correct form?

00:27:17.774 --> 00:27:21.435
You should either use smarter,
which is the correct and

00:27:21.435 --> 00:27:22.935
preferred comparative form.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:29.380
Or more smart, though smarter is much
more common, but definitely not both.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:30.520
Step four.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.760
So the error is in part A, due to that
redundant use of more with smarter.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.485
It's like wearing two
belts when one is enough.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.410
Correct sentence.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.800
She is smarter than any
other friend in her class.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.930
Excelling in all subjects.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.180
Example, three question.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:55.335
Identify the part of the sentence that
contains an error, neither a, the friends.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:02.260
Nor B, the teacher were C,
present at the D annual function

00:28:02.379 --> 00:28:04.210
causing much disappointment.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.800
Options A, nor the teacher B were present.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.700
C, annual function D. Much disappointment.

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:16.240
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:19.425
Solution, step one.

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:23.925
First, let's nail down the rule
for the neither nor conjunction.

00:28:24.345 --> 00:28:28.845
When neither nor connects two
subjects, the verb always agrees with

00:28:28.845 --> 00:28:31.125
the subject that is closest to it.

00:28:31.365 --> 00:28:32.805
This is a golden rule.

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:37.905
Step two, identify the subjects and
which one is closest to the verb.

00:28:38.355 --> 00:28:42.375
The two subjects here are the
friends, which is plural, and

00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:44.385
the teacher, which is singular.

00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:48.800
The subject closest to the verb
were present is clearly the teacher.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.390
Step three.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.230
Now check for verb agreement
with that closest subject.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:00.590
The teacher is singular, but the verb used
is were present, which is a plural verb.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.720
Uh oh, another mismatch.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.480
Step four, what's the correct form then?

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.265
The singular form of word.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.790
Is was step five.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:15.310
Therefore the error is in part B
because the verb were, does not

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.050
agree with the singular subject.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.760
The teacher, it's like the verb,
forgot its manners correct sentence.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.470
Neither the friends nor the teacher
was present at the annual function

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.390
causing much disappointment.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.380
Thank you.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.270
See you in the next lecture.
