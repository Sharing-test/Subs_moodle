Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on voice change.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.320
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.670
This is it.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.950
Concept, explanation, voice in
English, grammar, my friend, is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.450
all about the form of a verb.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.920
It tells us whether the subject of
the sentence is the one performing the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.920
action, which we call the active voice,
or if the subject is just receiving the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.830
action, which we call the passive voice.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.390
Understanding this is absolutely
crucial for building better

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.060
sentences in the active voice.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.800
The structure is simple subject,
then the verb, then the object.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.650
For example, she writes a letter.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:50.715
Here she is the superstar performing
the action of rights, but in the

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:55.515
passive voice, the poor subject just
sits back and receives the action.

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.675
The structure flips, the object comes
first, followed by a helping verb,

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:05.895
the past participant of the main verb,
and then by the original subject.

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:09.865
So our example becomes a
letter is written by her.

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:14.994
See a letter is now the subject
and it's receiving the action.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:21.205
The main idea of voice change is to flip
a sentence from active to passive or back

00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:24.175
again without losing its original meaning.

00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:26.755
It's all about changing the focus.

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:28.645
Real world relevance.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.960
Now you ask why bother with all this?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.300
Well, understanding voice change is a
real power move for any professional.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.060
It helps you to communicate with
incredible clarity and precision in all

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.460
those official documents and reports.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.259
It allows you to emphasize the
action or the result rather than the.

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:54.115
Person who did it, which is
often exactly what you need.

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:59.065
Informal communication to sound
really official and on top of things,

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:03.865
breakdown of question types in
the English section of your exam.

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:08.484
Questions on voice change are basically
testing your conversion skills.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.180
Looking at past patterns, we can see a.

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:12.285
Clear trend.

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:17.475
The most common type making
up a huge 60% of questions is

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.394
active to passive conversion.

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:23.924
You'll get an active sentence and have
to pick the correct passive version.

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:26.200
The second most comment is the reverse.

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:32.195
Passive to active conversion, which
appears about 30% of the time, and for

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:37.685
the last 10%, you might get a simple
question asking you to just identify

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:40.385
if a sentence is active or passive.

00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:42.334
Form your and tricks.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.325
Here are the.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.429
Key formulas, the secret recipe for
voice change, focusing on active to

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.619
passive since it's the most common.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.450
First, the general rule is that the
subject of the active sentence and the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.429
object of the passive sentence swap
places, they completely trade roles.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.209
The work form is next,
and this is a golden rule.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:09.125
Always use the past participant or
V three form of the main verb in

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.555
the passive voice, no exceptions.

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:17.015
To help our V three verb, we need an
auxiliary verb, one of the to be family

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:22.174
members, like AM is R was were B being.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:23.095
Or Bean.

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:26.365
This little word comes
right before the V three.

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:31.915
The subject of the active voice becomes
the agent in the passive voice, usually

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.245
introduced by the word by as in by him.

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:40.375
But if the agent is unknown or
unimportant, you can just omit it.

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:45.084
Most importantly, in short tense
consistency, the tense of the

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:46.945
sentence must stay the same.

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.135
No time travel is allowed here.

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:55.204
Lastly for sentences with modal verbs,
like can good or will, the structure

00:03:55.204 --> 00:04:01.415
is a simple formula, modal verb plus
B plus V three, methods of solving.

00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:04.265
Let's walk through the
step-by-step methods.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.580
For Method one, active to
passive transformation.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.600
First, you identify the
subject, verb and object.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.400
Then you swap them.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.760
Make the active object,
the new passive subject.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.570
After that, use the correct
to be verb that matches the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.280
tense and your new subject.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.290
Next, change the main verb into its
past participant, the V three form.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.130
Finally.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.150
Add by before the original
subject, which is now the agent.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.590
If the agent is general like
people or someone, you can often

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.760
leave it out for method two,
passive to active transformation.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.530
You work backwards, identify the
subject, the two B verb, the V

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.539
three, and the agent, which is.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.710
Part with buy now, swap them back,
make the agent the new subject.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.110
If there's no agent mentioned, you can
use a general subject like someone, then

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.700
change the V three back to its original
verb form, making sure that tense

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.919
matches what the two B verb indicated.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.930
Lastly, make the passive subject the
new object of your active sentence.

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.469
And for method three,
handling modal invoice.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.840
Change.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.460
It's quite straightforward.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.270
Identify the modal verb to
go from active to passive.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.670
Make the object the new subject.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.090
Keep the modal verb, but
add B right after it.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.340
Then use the V three of the main verb
and add by and the original subject.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.450
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques to

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.010
solve these questions faster.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.200
First, focus on the verb.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.500
This is the quickest way
to eliminate wrong options.

00:05:41.805 --> 00:05:46.605
Passive voice always, always uses
a form of two b plus a V three.

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:49.485
If an option doesn't have
this combo, it's wrong.

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:51.405
Second, check the tense.

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:54.165
Make sure the tense
hasn't magically changed.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:57.705
If the active sentence isn't
present continuous, the passive

00:05:57.705 --> 00:05:59.925
must be two like is being done.

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:04.555
Third, do a quick subject object
swap check to see if the roles

00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:05.995
have been reversed correctly.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.605
Fourth, eliminate obvious errors.

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:13.555
Any options that twist the meaning
and random new information or have bad

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:15.775
grammar can be thrown out immediately.

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:18.835
And finally, identify the by agent.

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:23.935
If the ACT sentence has a clear subject,
look for the bi phrase in the options.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.595
If the subject is vague, like
someone, the correct passive

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.160
option might cleverly omit.

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.525
The by phrase altogether, common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:35.775
Let's discuss some common traps.

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.955
A very frequent mistake
is changing the tense.

00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:40.185
I'll say it again.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.135
The tenses must remain the same.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:47.565
Another is using the incorrect to
be form, like mixing up is and was.

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:50.325
It's a small word with big consequences.

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:55.094
Also, people sometimes use an
incorrect past participant, so make

00:06:55.094 --> 00:06:57.015
sure you know your V three forms.

00:06:57.365 --> 00:07:00.185
Omitting by when necessary
is another issue.

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:03.665
While you can drop it for
general agents, it must be there

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.495
for a specific important one.

00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:09.935
And finally, a big misconception
involves int transitive verbs.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:14.195
These are verbs that don't take
an object, therefore they cannot

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:16.025
be changed into the passive voice.

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:22.325
A sentence like he sleeps cannot be made
passive because sleeps is an intrans verb.

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:24.125
What edge framework?

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:24.485
Summary.

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.705
So let's do a quick recap.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.710
What is voice change?

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.630
It's the transformation of a
sentences verb to show if the subject

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.060
performs or receives the action.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.860
Why is it important?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.560
It helps vary sentence structure and
is key for formality in communication.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.270
When do we apply it?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.380
When shifting focus from the
doer to the action itself,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.585
or to avoid naming the doer.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.430
Where is it used?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.500
Informal writing reports and all
kinds of general communication.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.150
Who benefits from it?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.140
Anyone writing or speaking
English, especially in

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.510
professional or academic contexts.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.490
And how do we do it?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.800
By changing the verb to A two B
plus past participant form and

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.185
swapping subject and object positions
all while maintaining the tens.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.460
Fully worked out.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.200
Examples, here are three examples
to make everything crystal clear.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.230
Example, one, active to passive.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.420
Simple present question.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.819
The carpenter makes furniture options
a. A furniture is made by the carpenter.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.120
B furniture was made by the carpenter
C. The carpenter is making furniture.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.420
D furniture has been
made by the carpenter.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.435
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.390
Solution First, identify the parts.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.700
Subject is the carpenter.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.650
Verb is makes simple, present,
and object is furniture.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.820
We swap them so furniture
becomes the new subject.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.680
Since the tents is simple, present
and furniture is singular, we use.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.870
Two B verb is the V
three of makes is made.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.700
We add by the carpenter, putting
it all together, furniture

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.350
is made by the carpenter.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.930
So the correct option is a
example, two active to passive,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.180
present, continuous question.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.400
They are building a new bridge.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.895
Options A, a new bridge is built by them.

00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:37.355
B, a new bridge is being built by them.

00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:40.535
C, a new bridge was being built by them.

00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:43.865
D. A new bridge has been
built by the passive.

00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:45.905
Understand the question before.

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.935
Moving to explanation solution here.

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:53.705
Subject is they, verb is are
building, present, continuous.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.925
And object is a new bridge.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:00.155
A new bridge becomes the new
subject for continuous tenses.

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:01.790
In passive we use being.

00:10:02.454 --> 00:10:06.865
Since it's present continuous and
the new subject is singular, the verb

00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:12.595
form becomes is being the V three
of building is built at by them.

00:10:12.954 --> 00:10:16.194
This gives us a new bridge,
is being built by them.

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:21.175
The correct option is B. Example,
three, passive to active.

00:10:21.235 --> 00:10:23.185
Simple past question.

00:10:23.454 --> 00:10:25.040
The ball was hit by the boy.

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:26.380
Options.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.420
A, the ball hit the boy.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.030
B, the ball was hitting the boy.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.370
C. The ball has hit the boy.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.560
D the ball hit the boy.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.670
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.069
Let's break down the passive sentence.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:48.105
The passive subject is the ball to
be verb is was V three is hit and

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:53.625
the agent is by the boy to make it
active, the agent, the boy becomes

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:56.084
the new subject, the passive subject.

00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:58.334
The ball becomes the new object.

00:10:58.694 --> 00:11:00.045
The verb was hit.

00:11:00.224 --> 00:11:04.365
Tells us the tense is simple
past the active verb for hit

00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:06.525
in the simple past is just hit.

00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:09.555
So we get the boy hit the ball.

00:11:09.885 --> 00:11:12.660
The correct option is a. Thank you.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.160
See you in the next lecture.
