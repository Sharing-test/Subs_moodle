Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Word association.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.710
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.845
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.895
So what is this word association you ask?

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:23.295
It's a fundamental skill in English
that tests how well you understand

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.695
the relationships between words.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:29.445
It's not just about memorizing
dictionary meanings.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:30.315
No, no.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.114
It's about seeing the invisible
threads that connect words.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:38.265
Think of it like a family tree for words.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.180
You have to recognize how they are
connected by their meaning, their context,

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.180
their category, or even their function.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.980
For instance, hot is related
to cold as an opposite.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.150
It's antonym.

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:58.580
Doctor is linked to hospital as
a profession and their workplace,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.650
and Apple is connected to
fruit as an item in a category.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.510
Getting a grip on Word association will
build you a super strong vocabulary

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.120
and make you a comprehension champion.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.610
Real world relevance.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.250
Now, you might think this is just
for exams, but understanding word

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.340
associations is critical for an officer.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.810
It helps you accurately read
between the lines in financial

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.910
documents and client emails.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.010
It ensures your own communication
with colleagues and customers

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.470
is crystal clear and effective.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.380
No misunderstandings on your watch.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.870
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.620
The questions you'll face come
in a few recurring flavors.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.800
About 30% of the time you'll get synonym
antonym pairs where you find words

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.900
with similar or opposite meanings.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.030
Then with a 25% frequency
come the clever analogies.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.109
These present a pair of words with a
special relationship and you have to find

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.539
another pair with the same relationship.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.310
Next up at around 20% is
the classic odd one out.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.870
You get a group of words and have to
kick out the one that doesn't belong.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.269
About 15% of questions will be
contextual usage, sentence completion,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.825
where you must pick the perfect
word to fit into a sentence.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.920
Finally, with a 10% chance, you'll
see word groups, categories,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.470
identifying words that belong together.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.195
Formulas plus tricks.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.085
All right, listen close.

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:43.725
Here are some tricks to
crack these questions.

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:49.035
First, you must identify the core
relationship are the words, synonyms,

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:53.445
antonyms, cause and effect, part
of a whole, a user and their tool.

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:55.905
Next, consider connotation.

00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:01.095
Pay attention to whether a word feels
positive, negative, or just neutral.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.480
Also check parts of speech.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.350
Make sure you are comparing
apples to apples, like a noun

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.570
to a noun or a verb to a verb.

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.600
You should also think
about function, purpose.

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.690
What does one word do in
relation to the other?

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.880
And finally, categorize.

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.989
See if the words can be neatly
filed under a common category.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.720
These tricks are your secret weapons.

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:26.645
Methods of solving.

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:30.905
Now, let's get into the step-by-step
methods for solving these

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:33.454
puzzles for those analogies.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:40.234
The A is to B as C is to D type First,
clearly identify the relationship

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:45.335
between A and B. Make a simple
sentence in your head describing it.

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:50.105
Then apply that exact same
relationship to the third word,

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.835
C, to find D from your options.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.700
Test every option to see which
one fits that sentence perfectly.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.010
For synonym, antonym questions, read
the word and recall its main meaning.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.510
If you need a synonym, look for the
option with the closest meaning.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.860
If you need an antonym, find
the one that is most opposite.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.899
A good trick is to mentally pop the
option into a sentence where the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.840
original word was used to see if it fits.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:26.200
For the odd one out, examine all the words
to find a common thread, a characteristic

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.020
or category that links most of them.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.039
Then spot the one word that
doesn't share this connection.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.799
That's your imposter for contextual
usage, sentence completion, read the

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.929
sentence carefully to get the vibe.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.169
The words around the blank are your clues.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.750
Then try putting each option into the
blank and see which one makes the most

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.170
logical and grammatical sense shortcuts.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.039
Smart techniques want to
work smarter, not harder.

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.000
Of course, you do always use
the elimination strategy.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.360
Get rid of the obviously
wrong answers first.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.150
This immediately improves your odds.

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.700
Next, use your detective skills with
prefix suffix, root word analysis.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:17.145
Break down complex words to guess
their meaning and connections.

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:20.085
Also look for contextual clues.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:24.375
Even if you don't know a word's
definition, the words around it

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:28.335
can give you enough hints and
remember the connotation check.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:33.570
Sometimes words mean similar things,
but one feels good and one feels bad.

00:05:34.284 --> 00:05:37.555
This emotional flavor can
be the deciding factor.

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:42.895
Lastly, always prioritize strong
relationships in analogies.

00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:47.215
Pick the option with the most
direct and precise relationship that

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:49.375
perfectly mirrors the original pair.

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:52.344
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:57.425
Now for a friendly warning about
common traps, the biggest one

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.515
is confusing sys with antonyms.

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:05.615
The question asks for an opposite, and
in a hurry you pick a similar word.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.985
Double check what is being asked.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.350
Another mistake is ignoring
subtle differences in meaning.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.560
Words can be closed but not identical.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.060
Overlooking these little details
can lead you to the wrong answer.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.660
Also, please don't be
jumping to conclusions.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.695
Review all the options before you
commit, even if the first one looks good.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.190
People also often get caught
misinterpreting analog relationships.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.830
They assume a simple link when a more
specific one is needed, and for goodness

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.980
sake, stop focusing on sound over meaning.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.240
Choosing words that sound similar
but mean completely different

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.640
things is a classic rookie mistake.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.590
W Edge Framework summary.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.740
So to wrap it all up, what is this?

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.180
It's all about understanding the
logical connections between words.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.710
Why should you care to improve
your vocabulary comprehension

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.060
and reasoning skills?

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.990
When is it applied in the
verbal ability sections of your

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.760
exams and in everyday life?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.489
Where is it useful in professional
settings for critical thinking

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:18.020
and clear communication?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.450
Who is this for Any friend preparing
for exams or really anyone who

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.489
wants to be a master of language?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.960
And how do we do it?

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:33.140
By identifying those semantic, contextual,
categorical or functional links between

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.260
words, fully worked out examples.

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:41.090
All right, let's put this theory
into practice with some examples.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.950
Example, one question.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.220
Choose the word that best
completes the analogy.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.960
Teacher school.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.940
Doctor options.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.260
A clinic.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.170
B. Patient C, medicine.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.650
D Nurse.

00:07:56.974 --> 00:08:00.185
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:01.625
Let's solve it.

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:05.974
Step one, what is the relationship
between teacher and school?

00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:08.315
A teacher works at a school.

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:09.034
Simple.

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:12.304
Step two, we apply that same logic.

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:15.965
A doctor works at a,
let's check the options.

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:17.385
A clinic.

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:20.205
A clinic is a place where a doctor works.

00:08:20.295 --> 00:08:21.735
This fits perfectly.

00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:27.405
B patient, A doctor treats a patient,
but doesn't work at a patient.

00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:31.155
C medicine, a doctor prescribes medicine.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:32.534
D nurse.

00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:34.125
A nurse is a colleague.

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:38.985
So option A clinic maintains
the exact same relationship.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:39.765
Correct?

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:43.725
Answer a. Example two question.

00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:47.835
Which word is an anm of abundant options?

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:53.565
A, plentiful B, scarce
C, ample D, copious.

00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:57.075
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:58.095
Okay.

00:08:58.335 --> 00:08:59.025
First step.

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:00.590
What does abundant mean?

00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:03.314
It means you have a lot of something.

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:04.455
It's plentiful.

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:07.875
The question asks for
an antonym, an opposite.

00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:09.795
Let's look at our options.

00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:13.605
A plentiful, that's a
synonym, not an antonym.

00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:15.225
B, scarce.

00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:17.835
This means there isn't
an enough of something.

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.605
That's sounds like the opposite.

00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:21.105
C, ample.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:22.725
This is another synonym.

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:24.255
D copious.

00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:29.835
This is also a synonym, so the only
one that means the opposite is scarce.

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:30.995
Correct answer.

00:09:31.145 --> 00:09:34.475
B. Example, three question.

00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:37.745
Identify the word that does
not belong to the group.

00:09:38.165 --> 00:09:39.365
Chair table.

00:09:39.485 --> 00:09:40.145
Sofa.

00:09:40.295 --> 00:09:40.865
Lamp.

00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:42.455
Bed options.

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:43.655
A chair.

00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:47.585
B, table C. Sofa, D lamp.

00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:51.035
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.095
Let's analyze this group.

00:09:53.515 --> 00:09:58.135
Chair, table, sofa and bed
are all types of furniture.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.465
You sit on them, eat at
them, or sleep on them.

00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:05.215
Now let's look at our odd
one out candidate lamp.

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.705
While you find a lamp in the same room.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.135
It's main job is to provide light.

00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:13.645
It's a lighting fixture, not
a piece of furniture in the

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:15.295
same category as the others.

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:19.465
So the lamp is the one that doesn't
fit in with the furniture club.

00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:20.605
Correct answer.

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:22.375
D. Thank you.

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:23.790
See you in the next lecture.
