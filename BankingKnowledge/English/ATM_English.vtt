00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.410
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on automated tele machine.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.410
This concept looks scary, don't worry.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.550
We brought snacks and
metaphors, concept, explanation.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.040
So what is this magical machine?

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.160
An automated tele machine or ATM, is
basically an electronic telecommunications

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.290
device that lets customers of financial
institutions do all their basic banking

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.390
without ever talking to a human.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.264
Think of it as your bank's
24 7 robot employee.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:36.185
You can get cash withdrawals, make
deposits, transfer funds, or even

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:37.805
just check your account balance.

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:42.964
It is a self-service banking outlet
made to give you convenience and access

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:45.035
for all your routine banking needs.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:49.565
These machines are designed to be
super user friendly, guiding you

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.435
through every step with onscreen
prompts and a simple keypad.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.135
Real world relevance.

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:56.905
Now, why should you care?

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:02.275
Because understanding ATMs is absolutely
crucial for efficient customer service

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.555
and managing operations in a bank.

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:09.145
You will be the one guiding customers
on how to use these machines and

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:13.105
ensuring these vital touchpoints
are running without any hiccups.

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:17.365
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:18.805
Questions on this topic.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.295
Love to pop up in a few standard formats.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:25.965
About 30% of questions are on
definitions and full forms, just

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:27.705
testing your basic understanding.

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:33.195
Another 25% focus on the different
types of ATMs and their features.

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:36.855
Like what makes a white label
ATM different from a brown label?

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:42.045
One around 20% of questions will be
about the functions and services offered.

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:44.955
So what you can and cannot do at an ATM.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:50.625
Security measures and frauds make up
another 15% because safety is key.

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:56.955
And finally, a small 10% is dedicated to
regulatory aspects like RBI guidelines and

00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.595
transaction limits, formulas and tricks.

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:04.455
Now don't worry when we say formulas, we
don't mean you need to do complex math.

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.675
It's more about key facts and memory aids.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:11.875
The full form of ATM is of
course, automated tele machine.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.075
PIN stands for personal
identification number for the types.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:17.995
Here's a little monic trick for you.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:21.595
White is for non-bank owned
and non-bank branded machines.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.320
Brown is bank branded, but owned
and maintained by a third party.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.140
Green is for agricultural transactions.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.400
Think green fields.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.200
Orange is for share transactions,
yellow is for e-commerce and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.430
pink ATMs, especially for women,
usually with security guards.

00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:42.305
And the most golden security tip of all.

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:48.905
Never, ever share your pin methods of
solving to solve questions on this topic.

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:52.115
You don't need a calculator,
just a good brain.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.905
The primary method is direct recall.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:58.505
For questions on definitions
of full forms, you just

00:02:58.505 --> 00:02:59.975
have to remember the facts.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:03.875
For questions that ask you to
differentiate between types, you

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.450
will use comparative analysis.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.700
Just compare their features side
by side to find the right answer.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.870
When you get a question about
security or operations, that's when

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.700
you use scenario based reasoning.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.630
Just analyze the situation they
give you and apply your knowledge.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.760
And if you are ever in doubt, my friend,
you the Evergreen elimination technique,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.140
kick out the options you know are wrong
and you'll get closer to the correct one.

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:33.635
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be extra smart about it?

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.495
Try acronym association.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:38.345
Link the color of the ATM to what it does.

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:42.155
Like we discussed, green for
agriculture, pink for women.

00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:43.145
Easy peasy.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:46.204
Also focus on the
keywords in the question.

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:51.845
Words like non-bank owned cash deposit,
or security are your clues to pinpoint

00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:54.065
the exact concept they're asking about.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.470
It's also helpful to
prioritize common functions.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.470
Remember, withdrawal and
balance inquiry first.

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.160
Then the less frequent ones
like bill payments, and please

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.779
get this straight in your head.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.589
Clearly distinguished between
ATMs, owned by banks, and those

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.239
owned by non-bank entities.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.459
This is a very common point of confusion,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:21.474
Let's talk about the common blunders
people make, but you won't after this.

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:25.495
A big one is confusing white
label and brown label ATMs.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:29.604
The mistake is thinking white
label ATMs are owned by banks.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:34.794
The correction is that white label
ATMs are owned and operated by non-bank

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:37.495
companies serving customers of all banks.

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:42.745
Brown label ATMs, on the other hand, carry
a bank's logo, but the machine and its

00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:44.844
lease are owned by a service provider.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.549
Another misconception is believing
all ATMs offer all services.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.870
That's a mistake.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.500
While withdrawals and balance
inquiries are universal, things

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.460
like cash deposits or bill payments
might not be available everywhere.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.820
Many people also
underestimate PIN security.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.340
Sharing your pin is a huge, huge mistake.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.780
It is strictly personal.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.359
Don't ignore transaction limits either.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.179
Be aware of the daily
limits set by your bank.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.270
And a very important one, not
checking for skimming devices.

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.190
Always, always visually inspect the
card slot and keypad for anything

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.000
that looks suspicious or out of place
before you start your transaction.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.130
WH framework summary.

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:28.619
So let's do a quick wrap up.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.330
What is an ATM?

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.020
It's an electronic device
for self-service banking.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.479
Why do we have them to provide
24 7 access to banking services

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:40.684
without needing a person?

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:42.620
When do you use it?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.950
Anytime, especially outside bank cars.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.140
Where are they located?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.799
Everywhere in public
places, malls and airports.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.030
Who uses it?

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.460
Bank customers with a card and pin.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:56.960
And how does it work?

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.000
By in inserting a card and entering your
pin to access your account services?

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.870
Simple.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.260
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.060
Let's look at an example.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.050
Example.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.600
One question, which type of ATM
is owned and operated by non-bank

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.100
entities, but provides banking
services to customers of all banks?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.540
A brown label, ATM B, green Label,
ATM C, white Label, ATM D, pink

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.680
Label ATM, understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.050
The solution is quite straightforward.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.630
Step one, the question score is owned
and operated by non-bank entities.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.570
Step two, let's recall our definitions.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.960
Brown label is bank branded,
but third party owned.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.810
Green is for agriculture, pink is for
women, and white label ATMs are the ones

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.790
owned and operated by non-bank entities,
and don't display any bank's logo.

00:06:57.025 --> 00:07:00.265
Step three, the characteristic
perfectly matches the

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:02.335
definition of a white label ATM.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:06.055
Therefore, the correct
answer is C. Example two.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:11.515
Question, what is the primary purpose
of a pin used in ATM transactions?

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:14.305
A, to identify the ATM machine.

00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:18.505
B to secure the customer's
account from unauthorized access.

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:23.275
C to verify the bank branch D
to select the transaction type.

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:26.455
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:30.585
Here, the key term is pin.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:31.665
What does it do?

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:35.445
A pin is your secret password
to prove it's really you.

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.155
Let's look at the options.

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.615
A pin doesn't identify the machine.

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:41.985
It has nothing to do with the bank branch.

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:46.380
And you select the transaction type
using the screen menu, not the pin.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.880
The fundamental purpose of a pin
is security to protect your account

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.830
from anyone else trying to use it.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.630
So the primary purpose is to secure
the account from unauthorized access.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.570
The correct answer is B example three.

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:04.555
Question, which of the following
is a common security measure?

00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:07.585
Advised for ATM users to prevent skimming?

00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:10.885
A, sharing your pin with
a trusted family member.

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:14.575
B, using only ATM's inside bank branches.

00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:19.615
C. Visually inspecting the card reader
and keypad for unusual attachments.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.155
D. Performing transactions
only during daylight hours.

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:26.305
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:32.804
The question is about preventing skimming,
which is basically the theft of your

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.995
card information using a hidden device.

00:08:35.294 --> 00:08:36.914
Let's analyze the options.

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:39.825
Sharing your pin is the
opposite of security.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:44.655
So A is out using ATM's inside
banks might be a bit safer, but

00:08:44.655 --> 00:08:46.035
skimming can happen anywhere.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.150
And criminals can place skimmers
at any time, day or night.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.750
The most direct and effective
action you can take is to

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.849
physically check the ATM yourself.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:56.719
Visually.

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:01.459
Inspecting the card reader and keypad for
any loose parts or weird attachments is

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:03.500
the best way to spot a skimming device.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.750
Therefore, the correct answer is see.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.739
Thank you.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.390
See you in the next lecture.
