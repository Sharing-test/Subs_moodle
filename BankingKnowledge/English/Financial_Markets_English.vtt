Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial markets.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.780
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.320
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.800
So what on earth are financial markets?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.259
Just imagine a giant marketplace,
a mailer, but instead of buying

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.670
vegetables, people and companies are
buying and selling financial assets.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.090
Like stocks, bonds, and currencies.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.460
It's a bizarre for money.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.740
These markets are the backbone that
helps businesses raise cash for their

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.500
operations and allows individuals
like you and me to invest our savings.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
They play a super crucial role in
our country's economy by channeling

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.700
funds from savers to investors.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:55.105
Which promotes economic growth
and helps in discovering the fair

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.695
price for assets broadly, there
are two types of these markets.

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:01.975
The first is the money market.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:06.475
Think of this as for short term
jugar, borrowing and lending.

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.625
Typically for less than one year.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:13.335
Instruments you'll find here are
treasury bills, commercial papers,

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.065
certificates of deposit, and repos.

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.815
It helps businesses and
even the government manage

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:21.405
their short term cash flow.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.015
The second is the capital market.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:27.795
This is for the long game,
dealing with borrowing and

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.535
lending for more than a year.

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.610
It's where companies raise capital for
long-term investments through stocks,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.759
which is equity and bonds, which is debt.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.919
The capital market itself is divided
further into the primary market

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.270
where brand new securities are
issued for the very first time,

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.685
like in an initial public offering
or IPO, there's direct interaction

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:55.009
between the issuer and investor.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.440
Then there's the secondary market.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
Which is like a secondhand
shop for securities here.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.670
Existing securities are traded
among investors on stock

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.400
exchanges like NSE and BSE.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.320
It gives liquidity to investors and
allows for continuous price discovery.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.425
Real world relevance.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:21.435
Now you might ask, sir, why
should iCare Well for a banking

00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:24.135
professional, this is not optional rn.

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:28.785
Understanding financial markets
is key as it directly impacts

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:33.435
lending decisions and managing a
bank's own investment portfolios.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:39.465
It helps in assessing market liquidity and
interest rate trends, which are absolutely

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.805
vital for daily banking operations.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:45.915
It lets you track the interest
rate trends that will affect how

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.925
loans are priced for customers.

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:53.535
It also provides fantastic insights for
risk management and staying on the right

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:56.145
side of the all important regulators.

00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:58.575
It's your financial weather report.

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:04.424
Breakdown of question types based
on typical patterns in your exam.

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:08.174
Questions on financial markets
will come in a few flavors.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:13.515
About 40% will be on conceptual
understanding, asking for definitions

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:18.975
of terms like money market, capital
market IPO bond, or the roles of

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.495
big players like RBI and sebi.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.475
Another 25% of questions will
focus on functions and importance.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.900
Asking about the role of financial markets
in the economy, or the specific jobs of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.780
the primary versus the secondary market,
then about 15% will target regulatory

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.261
bodies with questions on the powers of
Sebi, R-B-I-I-R-D-A-I and P-F-R-D-A.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.730
A smaller 10% chunk will be about
instruments and their features.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.610
Like the specifics of treasury
bills or commercial papers.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.980
And finally, the last 10% is for
current affairs or recent developments.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.790
So keep an eye on policy changes
or significant market events.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:05.955
Formulas and tricks for this topic.

00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:10.215
There are fewer traditional formulas,
but more key relationships and

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:15.105
definitions to fix in your brain
for yield to maturity or YTM.

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.785
Don't worry about the complex
calculation, just understand its concept.

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:25.155
It's the total return and investor expects
if they hold a bond until it matures.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.960
The most important relationship is
between bond price and interest rates.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.240
They have an inverse relationship.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.580
When interest rates go up, bond prices
fall, and the other way around, it's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.240
a seesaw also, no equity versus debt.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.620
Equity means ownership through
shares while debt is simply

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.600
a loan represented by bonds.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.080
Remember the big divide primary
market is for new issues.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.510
Secondary market is for existing ones,
and please memorize the teams money.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.500
Market instruments for the short
term are T-bills, commercial paper,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.840
certificate of deposit, and repos.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.820
Capital market instruments for the long
term are shares, debentures and bonds.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.680
Methods of solving for
conceptual topics like this.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.580
Solving methods really means
understanding the inner workings.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.430
First, use the definition based approach.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.260
If a question asks about commercial
paper, your brain must immediately

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.195
recall its definition, a short term,
unsecured, promissory note from a company.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:33.445
Second, use the categorization approach.

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:38.635
You have to understand which market and
instrument belongs to money or capital,

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:44.125
and if it's debt or equity, this is a
master key for eliminating wrong options.

00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:48.835
Third is function-based reasoning
For questions about an institution

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:51.025
reason based on its main job.

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:55.825
For example, SE B's primary function
is to protect investors' interests

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.865
and regulate the securities market.

00:05:58.245 --> 00:05:58.935
What else?

00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:04.155
Use relationship analysis for questions
about bond prices and interest rates.

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:09.705
Just apply the inverse relationship rule
and finally, use regulatory body mapping.

00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:15.315
Mentally link the regulators to their
fields, RBI to money and banking, sebi

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:21.435
to Capital and securities I-R-D-A-I to
insurance and P-F-R-D-A to pension funds.

00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:25.935
Shortcuts and smart techniques
ready for some shortcuts.

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:26.955
The good stuff.

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:29.235
Use acronym association.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:35.025
Create a memorable acronym for lists
like TCCR for the Money Market Gang

00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:39.615
Treasury Bills, commercial Paper,
certificate of Deposit, repo.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:44.445
Next, become a detective with
keyword spotting in questions.

00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:48.660
Identify keywords like short
term, long term, new issue.

00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:53.695
Existing security, equity, or
debt to quickly categorize and

00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:57.835
get to the answer, the elimination
strategy is your best friend.

00:06:57.835 --> 00:07:01.195
When in doubt, if you are
not sure, just throw out the

00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:02.935
obviously wrong options first.

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:06.235
It seriously increases your
probability of winning.

00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:08.455
Also use contextual.

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.844
Try to relate concepts to real
world things you've heard, like

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.155
a big company's IPO in the news.

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:16.895
It makes things stick.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:19.895
And my favorite tip, focus on why.

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:24.905
Instead of just memorizing what
something is, understand why it exists.

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:28.265
This deeper understanding
is magic for your memory.

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:31.125
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:34.935
Now let's talk about the
common traps people fall into.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:38.985
A big one is confusing the
money market and capital market.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.605
It's a classic mistake.

00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:42.735
Just burn this into your mind.

00:07:42.975 --> 00:07:45.435
Money equals short capital equals long.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.880
Another point of confusion is
primary versus secondary market.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.410
Many friends mix up where new securities
are issued, which is the primary

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.700
market versus where existing ones
are traded, the secondary market.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.750
Also, please do not misunderstand
the regulatory roles.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.990
Attributing SE i's role to RBI is A sin.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.420
Remember, RBI for money and banking,
sebi for securities and capital.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.040
A subtle one is ignoring the
unsecured aspect of commercial paper.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.400
And please don't think
all bonds are risk free.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.850
While government bonds are
very low risk, corporate bonds

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.590
definitely carry credit risk.

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:28.554
Lastly, don't believe all
financial markets are physical

00:08:28.554 --> 00:08:30.145
places with people shouting.

00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:33.385
Many today operate
completely electronically.

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:35.395
WH framework summary.

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:37.735
So let's do a rapid fire summary.

00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:39.684
What are financial markets?

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:44.875
They are platforms for trading financial
assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies.

00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:46.405
Why do they exist?

00:08:46.704 --> 00:08:48.655
They facilitate capital formation.

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:52.855
Enable investment and help in
price discovery for these assets.

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.444
When are they active?

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:59.245
They are always on during trading hours,
allowing constant buying and selling.

00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:00.535
Where are they?

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:04.885
They exist all over the world,
both as physical exchanges and

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:07.225
increasingly as electronic platforms.

00:09:07.584 --> 00:09:08.694
Who participates?

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:15.025
Investors, borrowers, intermediaries, like
banks and the regulators, and how does

00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:20.064
it work through organized exchanges and
over the counter markets where everyone

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.185
buys and sells fully worked out examples.

00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:25.435
Example, one question.

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:29.480
Which of the following instruments is
primarily traded in the money market?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.100
A equity shares, B Debentures C. Treasury
Bills D corporate bonds understand the

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.320
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.360
The question asks For a money market
instrument, the golden rule is money.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.450
Market means short term
maturity, less than one year.

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:49.395
Let's check the options.

00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:54.854
A equity shares are long-term ownership,
so that's capital market incorrect.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:59.984
B Debentures are long-term debt,
so capital market, again incorrect.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.224
C Treasury builds a
short-term government debt.

00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:06.135
A textbook example of a
money market instrument.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.820
Correct.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.320
D. Corporate bonds are long-term
debt, so that's capital market.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.290
So C is a clear winner, correct
answer, C example two question.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.370
What is the primary function of the
secondary market in the capital market?

00:10:21.795 --> 00:10:25.964
A, to facilitate the initial sale
of new securities by companies.

00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:30.974
B, to provide a platform for trading
existing securities among investors.

00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:34.245
C, to regulate the issuance
of government bonds.

00:10:34.484 --> 00:10:37.875
D to manage the foreign exchange
reserves of the country.

00:10:38.285 --> 00:10:39.785
Understand the question before.

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:41.104
Moving to explanation.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:44.615
The question wants the main
job of the secondary market.

00:10:44.974 --> 00:10:46.295
Remember our analogy?

00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:49.505
Primary market is the
factory outlet for new goods.

00:10:49.714 --> 00:10:52.505
Secondary market is
the OLX for used goods.

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:58.265
Option A talks about initial sale, so
that's the primary market's job incorrect.

00:10:58.564 --> 00:11:01.865
Option B talks about
trading existing securities.

00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:03.395
That's exactly it.

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:06.609
It provides liquidity so people
aren't stuck with their shares.

00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:07.625
Correct.

00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:10.114
Option C is A regulator's function.

00:11:10.354 --> 00:11:15.425
Option D is the central bank's job,
so B is the one, correct answer.

00:11:15.515 --> 00:11:20.525
B. Example, three question, which
regulatory body is primarily

00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:23.824
responsible for regulating the
securities market in India?

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:25.864
A Reserve Bank of India.

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:27.185
RBIB.

00:11:27.334 --> 00:11:30.214
Insurance, regulatory and
Development Authority of India.

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:32.015
I-R-D-A-I-C.

00:11:32.165 --> 00:11:34.625
Securities and Exchange
Board of India sebi.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.950
D Pension Fund Regulatory and Development
Authority P-F-R-D-A understand the

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.050
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.450
This is a direct mapping question.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.510
It asks for the regulator
of the securities market.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.370
Securities means stocks, bonds, et
cetera, which is the capital market.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.320
Let's map our regulators.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.580
RBI is for banking,
I-R-D-A-I is for insurance.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.730
P-F-R-D-A is for pension.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.110
That leaves us with sebi, the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.420
The name itself gives you the answer.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.890
Its whole purpose is to regulate
this market and protect investors.

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:13.420
It's a perfect match.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.680
Correct answer.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.310
See.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.180
Thank you.

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:17.680
See you in the next lecture.
