00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.500
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on negotiable instruments.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.290
This concept looks scary, don't worry.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.600
We've brought snacks and
metaphors, concept, explanation.

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:17.415
So what are these negotiable instruments
everyone keeps talking about?

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:23.564
Just think of them as very official
written IOUs that can be passed around.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.854
They are written documents that
promise to pay a specific amount of

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:32.549
money to a specific person or even
to whoever is holding the document.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.990
The bearer, the best part is they
are super easily transferable from

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.250
one person to another, either by
just handing it over, which is mere

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.440
delivery, or by signing it over, which
is called endorsement and delivery.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.420
Now, the person who receives this
instrument in good faith, and for some

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.810
value, we call this hero a holder in due
course, gets a perfect clean title to it.

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:04.245
This title is free from any story
or defects from previous holders.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.445
This feature makes them a
wonderfully convenient and secure

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:12.825
way to move funds or credit around
without carrying bricks of cash.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.520
As per the big rule book, the
Negotiable Instruments Act of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.340
1881, there are three main types.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.289
First, the promissory note.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.690
This is a simple written promise from
one person, the maker to another person.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
The payee promising to pay a certain
sum of money, either right away

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.380
on demand or at a future date.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.660
The maker must sign it and the promise
must be completely unconditional.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.115
No ifs or buts.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.130
Next is the Bill of Exchange.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
This one is a written
order here, one person.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.880
The draw is ordering another person, the
drawee, to pay a certain sum of money to a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.610
third person, the payee or to the bearer.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.210
This can also be on demand
or at a future time.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.595
It must be signed by the draw, and very
importantly, accepted by the drawing.

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.354
Finally we have the check.

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:10.965
Ah, the one we all know and use.

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:15.525
A check is just a special kind of
bill of exchange that is always

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:19.515
drawn on a specified banker and
is always payable on demand.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:23.415
It is, without a doubt, the most
common negotiable instrument

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.365
for our day-to-day transactions.

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:27.855
Real world relevance.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.530
Now you might be thinking,
why should I care?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.810
Understanding negotiable instruments is
absolutely crucial because they are the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.240
very backbone of banking operations.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
Making financial transactions happen
securely and efficiently every single day.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.500
If you want to work in a bank, proficiency
in this area is non-negotiable.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
It ensures you handle customer
funds accurately and follow all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.260
the legal banking standards.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.549
The key areas of relevance include
handling check operations, which is all

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.160
about deposits, withdrawals and clearing.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.630
Promissory notes are very often
a key part of loan documentation.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.010
In the world of international business,
builds of exchange are vital for

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.260
trade finance to secure payments.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640
Good customer service means being
able to explain different payment

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.185
methods and their implications.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.870
It's also critical for fraud prevention,
helping you spot any irregular or forged

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.970
instruments, and of course, for legal
compliance, making sure every transaction

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.880
follows the negotiable instruments act to
the letter breakdown of question types.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.465
Based on patterns from your exam.

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:43.965
The questions you'll face on this topic
usually fall into a few categories.

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:48.345
About 30% of questions are on
definition and characteristics.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.825
These will test your basic
understanding of promissory notes,

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:55.665
builds of exchange, and checks
along with their essential features.

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:59.805
Asking something like what is the
primary characteristic of a promissory

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:04.200
note, roughly 25% of questions
focus on the parties involved.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:08.725
You'll need to identify the
draw, draw, pay, and other

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.435
roles in different situations.

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:14.965
Another 20% will be on types and
distinctions where you have to

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:19.135
differentiate between the instruments
or spot which one doesn't belong.

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:24.835
Questions on dishonor and notice make
up about 15% focusing on what happens

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.515
when an instrument is not paid.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:31.665
And finally, about 10% of questions
are on endorsement and negotiation.

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:34.305
Testing your knowledge of
how these instruments are

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.605
transferred, formulas and tricks.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.330
While there are no MATS formulas here,
there are some key legal definitions

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.380
that act like formulas for you to
remember quickly for a promissory

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.540
note, remember the maker, the debtor
promises to pay, the pay the creditor.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.610
There are always two parties here.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.190
For a bill of exchange, the
draw, who is the creditor

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.320
orders, the drawee, the debtor.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.430
To pay the pay.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.470
You start with three parties.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.030
A check is always a bill of
exchange, is always drawn on a bank

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.160
and is always payable on demand.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.910
Remember the holder in due course or HDC?

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.190
This person takes the instrument for
value in good faith before its maturity

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.530
and without any notice of a defect.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.470
And HDC gets a superior title.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.340
Dishonor is simply when
payment is refused and giving a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.109
notice of dishonor is crucial.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.619
Negotiation is the transfer
of an instrument to make

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:34.000
the new person a holder.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.690
And endorsement is just signing
on the back to transfer it.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:40.030
Methods of solving.

00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:44.895
To solve problems related to negotiable
instruments, you need a systematic

00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:46.875
approach, almost like a detective.

00:05:47.174 --> 00:05:49.575
First, identify the instrument type.

00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:51.585
Is it a promise or an order?

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.174
How many parties are there?

00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:54.674
Is it payable on demand?

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.844
This tells you if it's a promissory
note, bill of exchange, or check.

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:01.275
Second, identify the parties.

00:06:01.604 --> 00:06:06.284
You must be able to name the draw,
drawee, pay maker, and so on.

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:09.945
In any scenario, this is the
key to understand who is liable.

00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:12.075
Third, determine validity.

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:14.955
Check if the instrument
meets all legal rules.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.110
Is it in writing?

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.190
Signed unconditional for a
certain sum with certain parties.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.360
Fourth, analyze the negotiation,
trace how the instrument was

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.500
transferred, noting each endorsement,
and whether the new holder is just

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.630
a holder or a holder in due course.

00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:33.294
Fifth, assess dishonor scenarios.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:37.375
If it's dishonored, find out
why and determine who is liable

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:41.034
and what steps like sending a
notice of dishonor must be taken.

00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:45.804
Lastly, calculate maturity if
it applies for time instruments.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:50.094
Calculate the exact due date and don't
forget to add grace days if they are

00:06:50.094 --> 00:06:53.635
applicable Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.380
Here are some quick shortcuts
for spotting the instrument type.

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:04.770
Look for keywords I promise to pay
screams promissory note, pay to X or

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.620
order points to a bill of exchange or a
check if it's drawn on a bank and payable

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.380
on demand for party identification.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.490
Remember the one making the promise
is the maker in a promissory note.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.500
The one giving the order is the
draw of a bill of exchange or check.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:28.050
The one order to pay is the draw,
and the one who gets the money is

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.170
always the pay for the HDC rule.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.419
Just remember the magic words
value good faith before maturity.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.919
No notice of defect.

00:07:38.415 --> 00:07:42.135
If any one of these is missing,
the person is just a holder,

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:45.435
not an HDC for check specifics.

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:51.045
Always, always remember a check is drawn
on a bank and is payable on demand.

00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:54.080
This is what separates it
from other bills of exchange.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.570
Finally understand the liability flow.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.910
Generally, the primary liability is
on the maker of a promissory note or

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.100
the acceptor of a bill of exchange.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.780
The secondary liability falls
on the drawer and any endorsers,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.930
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:15.465
Let's talk about the common traps.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:19.485
Many people confuse a promissory
note and a bill of exchange.

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:22.515
Just remember, a note is a promise.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.015
A bill is an order.

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:25.575
That's the core difference.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:27.765
Another mistake is thinking.

00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:29.865
All bills of exchange are checks.

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:30.585
Nope.

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:35.175
A check is a type of bill of exchange,
but not all bills are checks.

00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:40.745
A check has two special conditions
drawn on a bank and payable on demand.

00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:44.915
People also mix up a holder
and a holder in due course.

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:47.705
A holder just holds the instrument.

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:51.485
A holder in due course gets
special protection because

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:52.955
they acquired it properly.

00:08:53.435 --> 00:08:57.515
A big misconception is that
promissory notes need acceptance.

00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:58.415
They don't.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:00.725
They are a promise from the maker.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:05.464
Bills of exchange need acceptance
by the drawee to become binding.

00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:10.865
Also, don't ignore grace days for
instruments payable after some time.

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:13.175
Three grace days are usually added.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:18.995
Lastly, people forget that for the draw
or endorsers to be held liable, a proper

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.814
notice of dishonor must usually be given.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.360
WH framework summary.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:30.030
So to wrap it up with a quick summary,
what Unnegotiable instruments, they

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.050
are written documents promising or
ordering payment of a specific sum of

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.240
money, which are easily transferable.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.520
Why do we use them to facilitate secure
and efficient transfer of money or

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.574
credit without using physical cash?

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.750
When are they used in daily transactions,
trade and financial agreements that

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.820
need deferred or secure payments?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.920
Where are they applied in banking,
commerce, and both individual

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.660
and legal financial dealings.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.190
Who uses them?

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.840
Pretty much everyone, individuals,
businesses, banks, and other

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.220
financial institutions.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.160
And how do they work?

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:12.959
They are transferred by delivery or
by endorsement, creating legal rights

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.359
and obligations for everyone involved.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.670
Fully worked out examples.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.099
Example, one question.

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:23.910
Which of the following is a written
promise to pay a certain sum of

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.709
money to a specified person or to
the bearer, a bill of exchange?

00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:30.224
B check.

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:33.734
C promissory note D, demand draft.

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:37.125
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:40.125
Step one is to analyze the question.

00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:43.185
The key phrase here is
written promise to pay.

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:45.900
Step two is to recall our definitions.

00:10:46.685 --> 00:10:48.635
A bill of exchange is an order.

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:51.185
A check is also an order on a bank.

00:10:51.575 --> 00:10:55.715
A promissory note is explicitly
defined as a written promise to pay.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:56.705
A demand.

00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:58.145
Draft is also an order.

00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:00.845
Step three is to match the definition.

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:05.945
The phrase, written promise to pay is the
exact definition of a promissory note.

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:08.945
Correct answer is C promissory note.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.520
Example two question.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.810
A check is always payable
A after a fixed period.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:23.400
B, on demand C at the option of the draw
D, only to a specific person understand

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.320
the question before moving to explanation.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.830
First, let's understand
the nature of a check.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.840
It's used for immediate payment.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.390
Right now, let's evaluate the options
after a fixed period applies to time

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:42.000
bills, not checks On demand means payment
is due as soon as the check is presented.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.250
This perfectly matches the legal
and practical definition of a check.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.040
At the option of the draw is incorrect.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.970
Only to a specific person is
also wrong because checks can

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.230
be made payable to bearer.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.240
So by definition, a check is a bill
of exchange drawn on a specified

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.250
banker and payable on demand.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.160
Correct answer is B on demand.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.589
Example three question.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.310
Who is the primary party liable
to pay on a bill of exchange

00:12:10.369 --> 00:12:11.989
after it has been accepted?

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.459
A. The draw.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.219
B, the pay C, the draw.

00:12:16.219 --> 00:12:21.349
E. D. The accepter understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:12:21.895 --> 00:12:24.625
Let's identify the parties
in a bill of exchange.

00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:30.355
The draw issues the order, the drawee is
ordered to pay and the pay gets the money.

00:12:30.745 --> 00:12:32.785
Now, what does acceptance do?

00:12:33.175 --> 00:12:37.255
When the Drawee accepts the bill,
they agree to the order and take on

00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.995
the main responsibility for payment.

00:12:39.695 --> 00:12:42.485
Before this, the drawee has no liability.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:48.215
So after acceptance, the Drawee becomes
the accepter and is primarily liable.

00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:52.235
The draw's liability becomes
secondary, meaning they pay

00:12:52.295 --> 00:12:54.125
only if the Accepter fails.

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:58.235
Therefore, the party with primary
liability is the Accepter.

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:01.265
Correct answer is D, the Accepter.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:02.495
Thank you.

00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:04.145
See you in the next lecture.
