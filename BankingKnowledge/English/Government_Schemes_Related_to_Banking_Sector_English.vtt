00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on government schemes

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.190
related to banking sector.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.880
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.970
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.810
Explanation.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
So what are these government schemes
related to the banking sector?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.640
Ra, it's quite simple.

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:23.595
Think of them as initiatives or grant
plans launched by the government to

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:28.335
hit specific social and economic goals
using our trustee banking system.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:33.105
The main idea is to provide
financial services, social security,

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:37.065
credit, access, and support to
different parts of a population.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.370
Especially those who are often
left out or are a bit vulnerable.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.190
Our banks become the main channels, the
heroes of the story, making sure benefits,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.019
loans, and other financial goodies
reach the right people at its heart.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.280
This is all about boosting financial
inclusion, spurring economic growth,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.530
and improving social welfare using
a solid, accessible banking network.

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:03.360
Real world relevance.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.155
Now you might ask, why should I care?

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:11.315
Well, understanding these schemes is super
important because they are a huge part of

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.955
a bank's business and its social duties.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:18.875
Bank officers or CBOs are on the
front lines, dealing directly with

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.065
customers to make these schemes work.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:26.045
Take the Manna or P-M-J-D-Y here.

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:30.605
Our bank officers are busy opening
accounts and spreading financial literacy.

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:37.105
Bringing banking to every corner of the
country with the Phan Man Mudra or PMMY.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:42.115
They are sanctioning and giving out loans
to tiny and small enterprises, which

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:44.515
helps create jobs and entrepreneurs.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.615
For the Phan Man, Akha.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:51.805
Bima PM SBY, they enroll customers
in accident insurance, giving

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.335
them a crucial safety net.

00:01:53.755 --> 00:02:00.685
Similarly with the Phan ManVan J jy,
they help people get life insurance,

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.635
protecting families financially.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:07.255
For the Utter pension, Yona A PY,
they encourage folks to sign up for

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:11.245
a pension, promoting smart retirement
planning, and with the Standup

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:16.075
India scheme, they provide loans to
women and SCSD entrepreneurs driving

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:21.475
inclusive growth, breakdown of question
types when it comes to your exam.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.049
The questions on these schemes
follow a predictable pattern.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.910
Let's break it down, shall we?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.989
About 40% of the questions
are direct fact-based.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.399
These are straightforward memory
tests, asking for specific details

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.600
like launch dates, ministries,
age limits, or loan amounts.

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:43.774
For example, when was Phan Man launched?

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:49.174
Next, about 25% are objective
or feature based questions.

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:54.484
These focus on the main goal or key
features of a scheme, like what is the

00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:56.644
main objective of the Phan Man mudra.

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:02.704
Then we have eligibility criteria
questions making up around 20%.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.329
These check if you know who
can benefit from a scheme.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.500
Asking things like what is the
age limit for enrollment in pr,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
beneficiary or target Group
questions account for about 10%.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.000
Trying to see if you know the
specific group A scheme targets.

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:25.484
For instance, the Standup India scheme
primarily supports which groups,

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:31.545
and finally, a small but easy 5% are
abbreviation or full form questions

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:35.174
like, what does mudra stand for in PMMY?

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:41.114
Formulas and tricks for these schemes,
formulas are really just key facts.

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:45.105
You must tattoo onto your brain
and the tricks, little memory

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:47.234
aids or mnemonics to help you out.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.160
Let's look at some key
data points for P-M-J-D-Y.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.670
Remember August 28th, 2014, its aim
is financial inclusion and it has

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.160
an overdraft facility up to 10,000.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.269
Rupees for PMMY launched April 8th, 2015.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.049
You have the loan categories, SHU up
to 50,000, KiOR from 50,001 to five,

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.445
LAX and Tarun from five to 10 lax.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.450
For P-M-S-B-Y launched May 9th, 2015.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.760
The age is 18 to 70 years.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.320
Premium is now 20 rupees per
year, and coverage is too lax for

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.659
accidental death or total disability.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.860
P-M-J-J-B-Y, same launch
date, age 18 to 50.

00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:36.525
Premium is 436 rupees per year for a
two lack cover for death from any cause.

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:42.885
A PY also launched on May 9th, 2015,
has an age limit of 18 to 40 and

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:45.705
offers a pension from 1000 to 5,000.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.265
Rupees from eight 60.

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:53.534
Standup India launched April 5th, 2016,
offers loans from 10 LAX to one crow

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.205
for women and SCRS St. Entrepreneurs.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:05:03.215
And don't forget Sukanya Yona or
SSY from January 22nd, 2015 for

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:05.075
a girl child up to 10 years old.

00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:11.825
Lastly, the Kisan credit card or KCC
from 1998 gives timely credit to farmers.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.630
For memorization tricks.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.690
Remember the ninth May, 2015
Trio, P-M-S-B-Y, P-M-J-J-B-Y, and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.789
a PY were all launched together.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.190
A helpful sequence to remember
key schemes is J-M-S-J-A, Han

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.310
Mudra, Akhavan, Joti al for mudra
categories, tank of age progression.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.104
Shsu is the smallest, KI is the middle
child, and Tarun is the biggest.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.960
And please pay very close
attention to the age limits.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.670
They love to mix you up there.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.099
1850 for P-M-J-J-B-Y 1870 for pm MSBY
and 1840 for a PY methods of Solving.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.570
Solving these questions is
all about accurate recall

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.550
and a bit of smart thinking.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.789
First, identify the core question,
figure out exactly what is being asked.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:09.975
Is it the launch date, the objective
eligibility, or a specific benefit?

00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:12.855
Next, recall key details.

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:16.845
Access those facts you memorized
for that specific scheme.

00:06:17.325 --> 00:06:19.455
Then eliminate distractors.

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:21.015
Look at the options.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:25.995
Often one or two are obviously
wrong or belong to another scheme.

00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.285
Get rid of them.

00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:30.165
After that, compare and confirm.

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:34.905
If a couple of options seem right,
double check them against your memory

00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:37.035
to find the most precise answer.

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:42.555
Finally, use your contextual understanding
for questions about objectives.

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:46.495
Think about the scheme's larger
purpose and who it's meant to help.

00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:52.035
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:55.275
Of course, you do first
categorize schemes.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:07:01.005
Group them by purpose, like social
security credit or financial inclusion.

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.045
This helps in quick recall.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.785
Second, focus on unique
identifiers for each scheme.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:12.850
Know the one or two facts that make
it unique, like P-M-J-D-Y zero balance

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.405
accounts or mudras micro loans.

00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:17.895
Third acronym association.

00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:19.875
Always know the full form.

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.585
It often gives clues.

00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:26.294
Han means wealth for the
people and mudra means money.

00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:28.905
Fourth, have a numerical focus.

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:34.695
Pay extra attention to numbers like dates,
age limits, premiums, and loan amount.

00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:37.135
They are hot favorites for questions.

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:43.224
And lastly, try to make a ministry or
department link associate schemes with the

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:47.784
ministry running them like the Ministry
of Finance for most banking schemes.

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:50.925
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:54.765
All right, listen up, because this
is where many friends slip up.

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.195
A classic mistake is confusing.

00:07:57.195 --> 00:08:01.965
Launch dates, so many schemes
came out between 2014 and 2016,

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:06.345
and it's easy to mix them up,
especially that May, 2015 trial.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.040
Another one is getting the
incorrect age limits for the

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.960
insurance and pension schemes wrong.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.570
They are distinct, so don't confuse them.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.800
People also frequently mix up
premium or contribution amounts

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.350
for P-M-S-B-Y and PM JJBY.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.890
Misunderstanding loan
categories or limits in mudra.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.940
Confusing shsu, ki, and tharon
is another common blunder.

00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:33.205
A frequent error is identifying
incorrect beneficiary groups

00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:34.885
for schemes like Standup India.

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:39.775
And please don't ignore key terms
in the question like accidental

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:44.814
death for P-M-S-B-Y versus death
due to any cause for P-M-J-J-B-Y.

00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:46.495
These details matter.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.869
W framework summary.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.000
So to wrap it all up in a neat little
package, let's use the W framework.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.869
What are these government schemes
that use the banking sector to

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.150
deliver financial services and credit?

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:03.660
Why do they exist to
promote financial inclusion?

00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:07.015
Economic growth and social
welfare for the marginalized.

00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:11.785
When were they launched mostly in the
last decade with updates still happening?

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:13.405
Where are they implemented?

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:16.675
Nationwide through all our
banks and post offices.

00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:21.985
Who benefits a wide range of people
from individuals and small businesses

00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:24.055
to farmers and women entrepreneurs.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:28.855
And how do they work through direct
transfers, loans and premium collections.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.834
All managed via bank accounts.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.000
See, not so scary, fully
worked out examples.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.460
Let's walk through some examples.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.130
Example, one question.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.660
Which of the following government
schemes aims to provide universal

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.100
access to banking facilities with
a focus on zero balance accounts,

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.625
basic savings, bank deposit
accounts, and an overdraft facility?

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:57.800
A Han Mudra, PMMY.

00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:06.310
B-A-C-D-Y-D, PR

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:13.840
SBY understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.810
Let's analyze this.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.459
The keywords are universal
access to banking, zero balance

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:22.170
accounts, and overdraft.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.060
Option A-P-M-M-Y is for
business loans, so incorrect.

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.589
Option BAPY is a pension
scheme also incorrect.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.324
Option D-P-M-S-B-Y is
for accident insurance.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:42.734
Wrong again, but option C PR was
launched specifically for these things.

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:44.415
It's the perfect match.

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:46.604
Correct answer, C pr.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.500
Example two question under the
PR mudra PMM MY, what is the

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.490
maximum loan amount that can be
sanctioned under the third category?

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.680
A 50,000 rupees.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:07.350
B five LAC rupees, C 10 LAC
Rupees, D 20 LAC Rupees.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.330
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.110
Okay.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.860
This is a direct question about
PM MM Y's current category.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.960
Let's recall the three categories.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.840
SHU is for loans up to 50,000.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.320
Rupees.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.090
Keho is for loans from
50,001 up to five LAC rupees.

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:30.170
And Tarun is for loans from
five lack up to 10 LAC rupees.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.100
The question asks for the maximum
amount for tarun, which is

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:36.800
10, lack option A is for shsu.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.530
Option B is the upper limit for KiOR,
and D is not even a limit in PMMY.

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:44.569
Simple correct answer.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.340
C 10 LAC rupees.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:48.854
Example three question.

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:51.645
What is the annual
premium payable for the PR

00:11:54.704 --> 00:11:55.094
DY?

00:11:55.125 --> 00:12:02.685
For a coverage of two LAC rupees, A
12 Rupees B 20 Rupees C 330 Rupees.

00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:04.910
D 436 rupees.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.830
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.880
This question asks for the
annual premium of P-M-J-J-B-Y.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.040
You just have to know the number here.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.600
Let's recall the premium for
P-M-J-J-B-Y, which provides life

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.510
insurance, is currently 436 rupe.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:26.089
Option B 20 rupees is a classic trap.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.260
That's the premium for P-M-S-B-Y,
the accident insurance scheme.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:36.829
Option C 330 rupees was the old premium,
but it has been revised, so you need

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:40.819
to be updated, correct answer D 436.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.870
Thank you.

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:43.520
See you in the next lecture.
