00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Know Your Customer.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.480
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.210
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.550
So what is this KYC that
everyone keeps talking about?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.460
Imagine a bank asking a new customer.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.900
Hello, G. Who are you?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
Really that my friend is KYC.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
In a nutshell, it is a mandatory,
not optional process for banks and

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.840
all financial institutions to verify
the identity of their customers.

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:39.190
This isn't just about nosy, it
involves collecting and then double

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.209
checking personal information and
documents to be absolutely sure

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.370
that you are who you claim to be.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.459
The main mission, the ultimate goal of
KYC is to prevent all sorts of financial,

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:55.385
hanky panky, like money laundering,
terrorist financing, and fraud.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.515
How By understanding a customer's
financial habits and figuring out

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.865
the risks they might bring, it
helps banks create a sort of kundy

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:06.545
or profile for their customers.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:11.225
Keep an eye on their transactions, and
if something looks fishy, report it

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.235
to the big bosses, the authorities.

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:15.885
Real world relevance.

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:21.945
Now, why is this so critical for a big
shot like a CBO or Chief Business Officer?

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:24.255
It's about protecting the bank.

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:27.735
It's their shield for
financial crime prevention.

00:01:27.914 --> 00:01:32.350
KYC is the chalky D, the very
first line of defense against money

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.190
laundering and terrorist financing.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:40.015
It's also about regulatory compliance,
making sure the bank follows all the rules

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:45.265
laid down by the RBI and other regulatory
bodies, so nobody gets a scolding.

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:49.315
It is a key part of risk
management, helping to assess

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.530
and manage the dangers that come
with different customer profiles.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.780
For customer onboarding, it's
the fundamental first step

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840
to build a legitimate and
secure banking relationship.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.570
Let's not forget reputation protection.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.320
It guards the bank's good name
and the trust people have in it.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.570
And finally, it promotes ethical banking,
pushing for transparency and honest

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.820
practices in the whole financial world.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.395
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:23.625
Questions on KYC love to pop
up in a few predictable ways.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:29.235
About 30% of the time you'll get
definition or full form questions, asking

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:31.995
what KYC stands for, or its basic meaning.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.850
Another 25% of questions focus
on the purpose or objectives

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.280
asking why we even have KYC.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.930
Then about 20% of the time they
might ask about the components

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.910
or pillars of the KYC process.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.110
Questions about the regulatory
bodies or acts like the laws and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.760
organizations that run the KYC
show in India, make up another 15%.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:59.204
And the final 10% are usually
scenario based questions where they

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:03.100
give you a little story and ask what
the correct KYC action should be.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:05.985
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.365
Now relax.

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:10.815
KYC doesn't have any scary
mathematical formulas.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:15.015
Instead, it's all about remembering
some key names and ideas.

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:17.205
Think of these as your cheat codes.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:19.155
First, always remember.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.740
PMLA 2002.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.270
That's the prevention of Money
Laundering Act 2002, the big boss,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.640
the primary law for KYC in India.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.460
The RBI guidelines are also crucial.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.870
The Reserve Bank of India gives
out the detailed rule book for KYC

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.935
and anti-money laundering or a ML.

00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:42.234
On the world stage, we have FATF,
the Financial Action Task Force,

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:45.385
which sets the international
standards that India follows.

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:46.915
Within the process.

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:50.695
You have C, D, D, or customer
due diligence, which is just

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.519
the fancy term for identifying
and verifying the customer.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.440
For very important or risky people.

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.880
There's ED, D or enhanced due
diligence for low risk customers.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.670
We have SDD Simplified Due Diligence.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.589
The documents needed are simple,
POI, or proof of identity, like

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:13.595
a pan card or passport and POA or
proof of address like a utility bill.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.380
And finally, remember that
customers are sorted into risk

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.810
categories, low, medium, or high.

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:22.245
Methods of solving.

00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:27.914
When we say methods of solving for KYC,
we mean the steps a bank actually takes.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:31.364
First is the customer
acceptance policy or cap.

00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:35.325
The bank must have clear rules
for who it accepts as a customer.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.815
No ghost accounts and fake names allowed.

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:41.445
This also includes rules for when
they might have to say, Tata,

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:42.974
bye-bye, and close an account.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:47.234
Next is the customer
identification procedure or CIP.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.005
This is the paperwork part.

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:53.804
Collecting documents for POI and POA,
and then checking if they are real.

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:57.015
Then comes the risk
management framework here.

00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:01.844
The bank plays detective, categorizing
customers into low, medium, or high

00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:05.354
risk based on things like their
job income and where they live.

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:09.015
Based on this risk, they apply
the right level of diligence

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.875
after the account is open.

00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:13.725
The work continues with
monitoring of transactions.

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.955
The bank continuously watches for
any weird or suspicious activity.

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:20.475
And finally, there is record keeping.

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:25.095
The bank must keep all KYC records
for at least five years after the

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:28.455
customer relationship ends, just in
case someone needs to check them later.

00:05:30.224 --> 00:05:33.465
Shortcuts and smart techniques
to make this easier.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:37.515
Remember the four main pillars
of KYC, customer acceptance,

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:41.745
policy risk management, customer
identification, procedures, and

00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:43.875
monitoring of transactions easy.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:47.325
Also, always remember that PMLA is king.

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:52.034
The Prevention of Money Laundering Act
is the legal backbone for KYC in India.

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.345
Understand the risk-based approach.

00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:56.955
KYC is not one size fits all.

00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:01.575
The level of checking depends on whether
the customer is low, medium, or high risk.

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:05.835
Think of KYC as an ongoing
process, not a one-time thing.

00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:08.835
At the start, it requires
continuous monitoring.

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:15.105
Remember F AFS role, it sets the global
rules that India and RBI follow and for

00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:17.295
documents, just simplify it in your head.

00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:19.845
It's all about BOI plus POA.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.235
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.635
Let's clear up some common confusion.

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:30.015
A big mistake is believing
KYC is only for new customers.

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:34.845
The correction is that KYC is an
ongoing process and even existing

00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:36.765
customers need periodic updates.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.520
A common misconception is
that any ID card will work.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.090
The correction is that only
specific officially valid

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.340
documents or ovd are accepted.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.870
Another mistake is thinking KYC
is just about collecting papers.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.580
No, the correction is that it involves
understanding the customer's financial

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.955
behavior and source of funds.

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:01.469
A misconception is that low risk
customers need zero monitoring.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.430
Wrong again.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.590
They still require basic monitoring to
spot any changes, and a final mistake

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.049
is ignoring small problems in documents.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.030
The correction is that any discrepancy
must be investigated and fixed, or

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.650
the bank could be in big trouble.

00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:19.365
WH framework summary.

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:22.455
So let's summarize it
with the W framework.

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:23.355
What is it?

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:27.855
KYC is a process to verify
customer identity and assess risk.

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:30.795
Why do we do it to
prevent financial crimes?

00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:34.875
When is it done during account
opening in periodic reviews and

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:36.225
when suspicious things happen?

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.695
Where is it applied in banks and
financial institutions all over the world?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.770
Who is involved?

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.440
Banks use it and customers
are subject to it.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.640
And how is it done?

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.300
Through document checks, risk
assessment, and transaction monitoring.

00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:51.885
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:54.375
All right, let's tackle a few examples.

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:56.745
Example, one question.

00:07:57.015 --> 00:08:00.195
Which of the following is the
primary objective of know your

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:02.414
customer, KYC, guidelines in banking?

00:08:02.835 --> 00:08:05.445
A, to increase the bank's profit margins.

00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:08.985
B, to simplify the account
opening process for customers.

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:12.315
C, to prevent money laundering
and terrorist financing.

00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:15.015
D, to reduce the number of bank branches.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:18.135
Understand the question before
moving to the explanation.

00:08:18.844 --> 00:08:19.895
Let's break it down.

00:08:20.255 --> 00:08:24.335
The core purpose of KYC is all
about security and regulation.

00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:29.044
Option A increasing profits is
a business goal, not a KYC goal.

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:33.005
Option B is the opposite of
what KYC sometimes feels like.

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.715
Its goal is verification.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.010
Not simplification.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.789
Option D, reducing branches
is completely unrelated.

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:44.380
Option C, preventing money laundering
and terrorist financing is the textbook

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.390
definition of why KYC was created.

00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:53.295
It is the direct and primary objective,
correct answer c. Example two question.

00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:58.155
Under the Indian KYC guidelines, which of
the following is considered an officially

00:08:58.155 --> 00:09:00.345
valid document for proof of identity?

00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:06.975
A. Library membership card B, pan card
C, electricity bill without address D.

00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:11.055
School ID card understand the question
before moving to the explanation.

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:14.900
Okay, we need to find the
officially valid document here.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.900
Ovd are specific government
issued documents.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:21.890
A library card, option A is not
an official government ID for

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.989
this purpose, an electricity bill.

00:09:23.989 --> 00:09:27.500
Option C is for proof of
address and without an address.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.609
It's useless anyway.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.900
A school ID.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.699
Option D is not considered a valid
OVD for banking, but a pen card.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:39.800
Option B is a government issued identity
document and is explicitly on the RBI's

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.484
list of OVS for proof of identity,
correct answer b. Example three question.

00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:50.834
What is the minimum period for which
banks are required to maintain KYC

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:56.084
records after the business relationship
with a customer has ended a two years B,

00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:59.535
three years, C, five years, D, 10 years?

00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:02.444
Understand the question before
moving to the explanation.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.400
Okay.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.860
This question is about memory regulations,
specifically the PMLA state, A clear rule

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.930
for how long banks must keep our data.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.870
This is to help with any
future investigations.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.130
The rule says that records of
transactions and customer ID must

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.880
be kept for a minimum period of five
years after the relationship has ended.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.130
Options A and B are too short.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.710
Option D is longer than
the minimum required.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.415
The correct minimum period is five
years, correct Answer c. Thank you.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.855
See you in the next lecture.
