Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on Priority Sector Lending, PSL.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.100
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.830
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.190
Priority Sector lending or PSL refers
to the mandatory allocation of a certain

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.900
percentage of a bank's total lending
to specific sectors of the economy.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
These sectors are considered vital
for the country's development, but

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.320
might not receive adequate credit.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.690
Otherwise, they include agriculture,
micro, small, and medium enterprises.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.300
MSME, education, housing, social
Infrastructure, renewable Energy, and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.420
others, the Reserve Bank of India, the
RBI mandates these targets to ensure

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.340
that credit flows to these crucial
sectors, fostering inclusive growth and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.710
supporting vulnerable sections of society.

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:59.324
It's a key tool for financial inclusion,
ensuring credit is not just available to

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:04.815
large corporations, but also to smaller,
often underserved segments of the economy.

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:10.545
Real world relevance as a banker,
understanding PSL is crucial

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:15.195
for ensuring the bank meets its
regulatory obligations and contributes

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:16.580
to national development goals.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.850
It directly impacts your
role in identifying eligible

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.900
borrowers and structuring loans
to comply with RBI guidelines.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.390
The key areas of relevance are
regulatory compliance as banks must

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.430
meet targets to avoid penalties,
financial inclusion, ensuring credit

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.680
reaches farmers and small businesses.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:43.135
Risk management, which diversifies the
loan portfolio business development,

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:49.255
creating opportunities to serve a broader
customer base social responsibility, which

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:54.805
aligns banking operations with national
priorities and performance evaluation.

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:59.335
As a bank's PSL performance is a key
metric in its overall assessment.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns in your exam.

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.729
Questions on priority sector
lending typically fall into

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.019
the following categories.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.460
About 30% are direct definition
or concept questions.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.620
Testing the basic understanding of PSL,
its purpose or the regulatory body.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.390
Around 35% are target-based
questions, which require knowledge

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.010
of specific percentage targets for
overall PSL or its subcategories.

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:33.275
Next 20% are category specific
questions for identifying which

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:37.595
activities or beneficiaries fall
under a particular PSL sector.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:43.175
Then 10% are loan limit questions
on the maximum loan amounts eligible

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:45.035
under certain PSL categories.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:50.135
Finally, though, less frequent at 5%,
there are non-compliance or penalty

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:54.500
questions which might ask about the
implications of not meeting PSL targets.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.690
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.019
Here's the key targets and
limits for scheduled commercial

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.890
banks, excluding regional rural
banks and small finance banks.

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:09.950
The overall PSL target is 40% of
adjusted net bank credit or credit,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.579
equivalent of off balance sheet
exposures, whichever is higher.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.940
For agriculture, it is
18% of and A or CEOB.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.280
There is a SubT targett within agriculture
for small and marginal farmers of 10%.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.705
A SubT TARGETT within MSME for
microenterprises is 7.5% and a SubT

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.070
targett for weaker sections is 12%.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.210
For education, loans, loans up
to 20 LAC rupees are eligible.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:41.295
For housing loans, loans up to 35 LAC
rupees in metropolitan centers and

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.734
up to 25 LAC rupees in other centers
are eligible, provided the overall

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:50.204
cost of the dwelling does not exceed
45 LAC and 30 LAC respectively.

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:54.375
For repairs, it's up to 10 LAC
rupees in metro centers and six

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.635
LAC rupees in other centers.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.060
Here's a trick.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:04.320
Remember the main percentages,
40%, 18%, 10%, 7.5%, and 12%.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.329
Visualize them as a pyramid with 40%
at the top, and then the specific

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.760
SubT targets methods of solving.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.360
When approaching questions related
to PSL, follow these general methods.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.760
First is understanding the base.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.980
Always identify the base for calculation,
which is typically ANAC or CEOB.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.290
Second, applying overall target.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.210
To find the minimum amount,
multiply the and A COB by 0.40.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.910
Third, applying sector specific targets.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.099
For agriculture, multiply,
and A was CEOB by 0.18.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.080
For micro enterprises, multiply
by 0.075 and for weaker sections

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:47.940
by 0.12 Fourth, identifying
eligible categories for questions,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.770
asking about specific activities.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.150
Recall the broad categories under
p. S. Fifth loan limit checks.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.750
If a question involves a specific
loan amount, compare it against the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.550
prescribed limits for that category.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.260
Shortcuts and smart techniques for
shortcuts, you should categorize and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.159
memorize group the PSL categories
and their respective targets.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.750
Focus on exceptions.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.620
Pay special attention to what
doesn't qualify under PSL, like

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.270
loans to a bank's own staff.

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:17.215
Understand weaker sections.

00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:22.854
Remember the broad groups included, like
small farmers, artisans, sc ord, and

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:24.565
beneficiaries of government schemes.

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:27.055
Remember that anac is key.

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.635
Most calculations revolve around anac.

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:32.215
And finally, practice with percentages.

00:05:32.455 --> 00:05:35.995
Get comfortable quickly calculating
percentages of large numbers.

00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:38.495
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.955
Be aware of these common mistakes.

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:45.725
Confusing overall target With SubT
targets, a common error is to think

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:49.715
that meeting the 40% overall target
means all SubT targets are met.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:54.365
Banks must meet both incorrectly
identifying eligible activities.

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:58.025
Not all loans to a sector
qualify ignoring loan limits.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.150
For categories like housing or education,
there are specific maximum loan amounts

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.820
that qualify, misunderstanding, and back.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.049
It is adjusted net bank credit,
a precise calculation, and

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.760
forgetting the regulatory body.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.820
Remember, the RBI is the primary regulator
for PSL in India, WH framework summary.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.640
Let's quickly summarize what it is.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.010
Mandatory lending targets set by RBI.

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:27.615
Why it is for inclusive growth
and financial inclusion when it is

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:32.025
applicable to all scheduled commercial
banks on an ongoing basis, where it

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:36.675
is across all regions of the England
economy who banks are mandated to lend.

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:41.265
And sectors like agriculture and
MSME benefit how it is done through

00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:46.155
prescribed percentage targets of ANAC
or CEOB, fully worked out examples.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.390
Example, one question.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.370
A commercial banks has an adjusted
net bank credit of 150,000 crow.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.120
What is the minimum amount the
bank must lend to the priority

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.980
sector to meet its overall target?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.910
A 45,000 Crow B 60,000 crow.

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:07.105
C 75,000 K Crow D 30,000 Crow.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:10.045
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.405
The overall PSL target is 40% of amba.

00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:17.005
The AMBA is given as 150,000 K crow.

00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:21.295
To find the minimum amount, we
just calculate 40% of this value.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:27.145
So 150,000 crow multiplied
by 0.40 equals 60,000 crow.

00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:31.570
The correct answer is option
B. Example two question.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.710
Which of the following loans to an
individual would not typically qualify

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.060
under the housing loan category for PSL,
assuming it's in a metropolitan center,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.280
a loan of 30 LAC rupees for the purchase
of a new dwelling unit costing 40 lag.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.760
B loan of 35 LAC rupees
for the construction of a

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.740
dwelling unit costing 42 lag.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.200
C loan of 40 LA rupees for the acquisition
of a dwelling unit costing 50 LAC rupees.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.270
D loan of eight LAC rupees for
repairs to an existing dwelling unit.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.210
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.180
Let's recall the norms
for a metropolitan center.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.870
The loan amount can be up to
35 LAC rupees, and the overall

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.090
cost must not exceed 45 lack.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.530
Let's check the options.

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:16.530
Option A and B are within both limits.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.200
Option D is for repairs and its eight.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.780
Lack amount is within the
10 LAC limit for repairs.

00:08:22.049 --> 00:08:27.210
However, option C shows a loan of 40 LAC
rupees, which exceeds the 35 lack limit.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.909
The cost also exceeds the 45 lack limit.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.555
Therefore this loan would not qualify.

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:38.465
The correct answer is option C. Example
three question A bank's and back is two.

00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:39.185
ROEs.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:43.985
What is the minimum amount it must lend
to Microenterprises to meet its SubT?

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.725
Targett, A 15,000 crow.

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:51.770
B 20,000 K Crow C 10,000
Crow D 7,500 K Crow.

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:54.650
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:59.060
The SubT targett for
microenterprises is 7.5% of and back.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.400
The given and back is two LAC rupees.

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:04.640
We need to calculate 7.5% of this amount.

00:09:04.849 --> 00:09:09.860
So two lac rupees multiplied
by 0.075 gives us 15,000 crow.

00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:14.385
This matches option A. The correct
answer is option A. Thank you.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:15.765
See you in the next lecture.
