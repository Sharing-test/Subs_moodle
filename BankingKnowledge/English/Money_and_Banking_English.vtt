00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.019
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on money and banking.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.490
We're about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:09.965
concept with this tutorial.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:12.885
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.344
All right, let's get straight into it.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.625
Money and banking are the two big
pillars holding up any modern economy.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.064
If you want to work in banking, you
have to know the stuff inside out.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:26.745
So what is money?

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:32.845
At its heart, money is simply anything
that is generally accepted as payment

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.754
for goods and services or to repay debts.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:40.885
Before we had our lovely currency notes,
people were stuck with the barter system.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:45.385
Just imagine a farmer trading his
wheat for a carpenter's chair.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.605
It sounds simple, but it was.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.760
Terribly inefficient because of something
called the double coincidence of wants.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.260
What a mouthful, eh?

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.879
It just means that both people
had to want exactly what the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.260
other person was offering.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.250
The farmer needs a chair, and
the carpenter must need wheat.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.090
If the carpenter wanted
shoes instead, well no deal.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.229
Money came in and solved this
massive headache by performing

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.759
several key functions.

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:16.605
First, it's a medium of exchange.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.335
It completely removes the need for barter.

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:24.195
You can sell your goods for money and
then use that money to buy whatever you

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:26.955
want whenever you want, so much simpler.

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.535
Second, it's a unit of account.

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:32.715
It gives us a common
measuring stick for value.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.595
Every single thing from a tiny pin.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.600
To a huge house can be priced
in money, making it super

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.550
easy to compare their values.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.980
Third, it's a store of value.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.480
This function allows people to save
their purchasing power for later.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.620
Of course, its value can get eaten
away by our friendly neighborhood

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.760
villain in inflation, but generally
it holds its value over time.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
And fourth, it's a standard
of deferred payment.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.780
This fancy phrase means it allows
for future payments, which is the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.240
backbone of all borrowing and lending.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.389
All debts are usually set in money terms.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.970
Now let's talk about banking.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.530
Banking is the business of accepting
and looking after the money owned by

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.570
people and companies, and then lending
that money out to help the economy grow.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.010
Think of banks as the middlemen
or financial intermediaries.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.460
Connecting those who have extra money.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.500
The savers with those who need it, the
borrowers, commercial banks are the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.630
ones you and I deal with every day.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.740
They take our deposits like
in savings, current or fixed

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.090
accounts, and give out loans.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.130
For personal use business or housing.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.110
They also offer other handy services
like sending money, providing locker

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.510
facilities, and of course credit cards.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.600
Examples you see everywhere are State Bank
of India, HDFC Bank, and I-C-I-C-I bank.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.440
Then we have the big boss,
the Central Bank, which in

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.360
India is our very own reserve.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.950
Bank of India or RBI.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:11.565
Every country has one, and its job is
to regulate the entire banking system

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.605
and control the supply of money.

00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:16.875
The RBI has some very important functions.

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:21.644
It is the monetary authority,
meaning it creates implements, and

00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:23.894
keeps an eye on the monetary policy.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.880
It's also the regulator and supervisor
of the financial system setting

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.410
the main rules for how banks should
operate it is the manager of Foreign

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.810
Exchange handling the Foreign Exchange
Management Act of FEMA from 1999.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.370
It is the issuer of currency,
the only body that can issue and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.500
exchange currency notes and coins.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.450
It also plays a developmental role
helping financial institutions and

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.400
markets grow, and it's the banker to the
government managing the bank accounts

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.590
of both central and state governments.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.850
Finally, it's the banker to banks
holding the bank accounts of all

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.460
scheduled banks, key concepts.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.610
Now for a few key ideas, you must.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.054
No.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.885
First is inflation.

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:14.084
This is when there's a sustained
increase in the general price level

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:16.274
of goods and services over time.

00:04:16.784 --> 00:04:20.414
In simple words, your money
buys less than it did before.

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:24.914
That a hundred rupe note just
doesn't stretch as far as it used to.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:27.375
Next is monetary policy.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.150
This is the process the Central bank
uses to control the supply of money.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.610
It often targets an inflation rate or
an interest rate to make sure prices are

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.040
stable and people trust the currency.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.830
Finally, there's credit creation.

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.510
This is the almost magical process
where commercial banks create new

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.610
money just by giving out loans.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.870
When a bank lends you money, it
creates a deposit in your account,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.640
which effectively increases the.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:57.915
Total money supply in the economy.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.810
Real world relevance.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.729
Why does all this matter?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.900
Understanding money and banking
is absolutely vital to manage

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.229
customer finances properly
and follow all the rules.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.240
It directly impacts every decision
on lending, managing deposits, and

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.440
giving financial advice, making
sure the bank operates soundly.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.240
For customer financial management, this
knowledge helps a banker give the right

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.530
advice to customers based on their
specific needs and how much risk they

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.200
can take for regulatory compliance.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.700
Understanding the rules ensures that
banks follow important guidelines like

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.340
KYC norms, anti-money laundering rules.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.260
And fair lending practices
and for decision making.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.130
This knowledge is critical for
making smart decisions on interest

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.300
rates, loan approvals, investment
strategies, and managing risks.

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:56.025
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for the exam.

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:59.235
Questions from this section
follow a predictable format.

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.835
About 30% are definitions and concepts.

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:08.025
These questions will ask for the
definition of terms like repo rate, SLR

00:06:08.085 --> 00:06:13.935
inflation M three, or check or ask you
to identify functions of money or banks.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:18.195
Around 25% of questions
are on functions and roles.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.450
These focus on the main functions of
money, the role of RBI, what commercial

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.210
banks do or specific banking services.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.620
Another 20% are on monetary
policy tools and their impact.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.530
These will be about C-R-R-S-L-R.

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:39.085
Repo rate and so on, and how they affect
liquidity inflation, or lending rates.

00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:44.125
About 15% are on banking instruments
and products, asking about things

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.934
like bonds, shares, types of
accounts, or banking products.

00:06:48.354 --> 00:06:52.405
A small 5% might be on the
history and evolution of banking.

00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:57.625
With basic questions on when RBI was
set up or about bank nationalization,

00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:02.994
and the final 5% are on regulatory
bodies and acts covering the Banking

00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:08.815
Regulation Act, fema, or the roles of
other regulators, formulas and tricks.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:13.895
While this topic is less about math,
it's all about understanding key

00:07:13.895 --> 00:07:16.895
definitions, relationships, and acronyms.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:22.355
To remember the functions of money,
you can use a little trick F. It

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:26.645
stands for facilitates exchange,
which is the medium of exchange.

00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:32.405
Intermediate store of value are store
of value, common measure of value, the

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:36.724
unit of account and contractual payment,
the standard of deferred payment.

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:42.885
Now for monetary aggregates, which measure
the money supply, they are ranked by

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:45.615
liquidity from most liquid to least.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:50.775
M1 is the currency with the public
plus demand deposits with banks,

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:56.625
plus other deposits with the RBIM
two is simply M1 plus the savings

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.905
deposits of post office savings banks.

00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:05.155
M three, also known as broad money is
M1 plus the time deposits with banks.

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:09.655
And M four is M three plus
the total deposits with post

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.365
office savings organizations.

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:13.675
But this excludes national
savings certificates.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.200
Let's look at the monetary policy
tools, the quantitative ones, CRR or

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.790
cash reserve ratio is the percentage
of net demand and time liabilities.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:31.390
NDTL that banks must keep with the
R-B-I-S-L-R or statutory liquidity ratio

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.680
is the percentage of NDTL that banks
must maintain in liquid assets like.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.919
Cash gold or approved securities.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.179
The repo rate is the rate at which
commercial banks borrow from the

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:47.080
RBI by selling securities with
an agreement to buy them back.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.720
The reverse repo rate is the opposite.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.260
It's the rate at which RBI
borrows from commercial banks.

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:59.015
MSF or marginal standing facility is a
rate at which banks can borrow overnight

00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:04.025
from the RBI against securities, even
if they have used up their SLR quota.

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:08.525
The bank rate is the rate at which
the RBI lends to commercial banks

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:13.835
without any collateral and OMO or open
market operations is the buying and

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:17.945
selling of government securities by
the RBI to control the money supply.

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:21.215
Generally, there's a
relationship between these rates.

00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:25.730
The ban rate is usually higher than
the MSF rate, which is higher than

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.240
the repo rate, which is in turn
higher than the reverse repo rate.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.210
Methods of solving, solving problems in
money and banking is mostly about your

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.640
conceptual clarity and logical thinking.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.690
For definition based questions,
read the question carefully to

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.430
see what term is being asked.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.400
Recall its precise
definition and functions.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.740
Then compare the options with
your memory and choose the

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.110
best one for impact analysis.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.540
Questions like those on monetary policy.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.800
First, identify the tool mentioned,
say an increase in the repo rate.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.480
Understand its immediate effect on the
bank's liquidity or cost of borrowing.

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:07.480
Then trace the ripple
effect through the economy.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.980
A change in bank liquidity leads to a
change in their lending rates, which

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.209
affects borrowing by businesses and
people, which then impacts investment

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:20.199
and consumption, and finally affects
inflation or economic growth.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.010
Choose the option that describes
this ultimate impact correctly.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:29.265
For function-based questions,
identify the institution whose

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:30.825
functions are being asked.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:35.505
Whether it's the RBIA
commercial bank on money itself.

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:39.585
Recall its main responsibilities,
and check each option against them.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.890
For comparison questions like CRR versus
SLR, clearly understand the two concepts.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.070
List out their characteristics, purposes
and differences, and then find the option

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.440
that correctly points out the distinction.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.150
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.010
Here are some smart techniques
to help you use keyword spotting.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.339
In definition questions
look for key terms.

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:12.410
For example, the phrase lender
of last resort almost always

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.410
points to the central bank.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.030
The elimination strategy
is your best friend.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.980
If you are not sure, get rid of the
options that are clearly wrong or

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.839
have nothing to do with the topic.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.709
This seriously increases your
chances of getting it right.

00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:32.689
Have some contextual understanding
for policy impact questions.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.180
Think about the bigger economic picture.

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:39.620
If inflation is high, you know
the central bank will likely do

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.420
something to reduce the money supply.

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:44.695
Also try to memorize acronyms.

00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:50.755
Knowing the full forms and basic
purpose of acronyms like N-D-T-L-L-A-F,

00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:53.485
and MSF can be a lifesaver.

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:57.685
And for policy questions, you
can use reverse engineering.

00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:03.445
If the question asks what to do to
curb inflation, think backwards about

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:08.095
which policy action, like increasing
interest rates would achieve that goal.

00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:10.915
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:14.305
Let's talk about the common
traps people fall into.

00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:17.725
Many people confuse CRR and SLR.

00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:21.775
Remember, CRR is cash kept with the RBI.

00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:26.275
While SLR is liquid assets
kept by the banks themselves,

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:28.945
both are percentages of NDTL.

00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:33.435
Another big one is mixing up
fiscal and monetary policy.

00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:38.745
Fiscal policy is handled by the government
dealing with taxes and spending.

00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:42.855
Monetary policy is the central
bank's job, managing money,

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.475
supply, and interest rates.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.160
Don't believe that commercial
banks don't create money.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.090
They absolutely do through the
process of credit creation.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.440
Also, don't misunderstand
inflation versus deflation.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.650
Inflation is a general rise in prices.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.770
Deflation is a general fall in prices.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.370
And please don't get
the rbis rolled wrong.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.820
The RBI is the regulator and supervisor.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.750
It doesn't deal directly with
the public for deposits or loans.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.700
That's for commercial banks.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.180
Lastly, don't assume
interest rates are fixed.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.470
They are dynamic and are always
changing based on central bank

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.900
policies and market demand and supply.

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:28.475
WH framework summary.

00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:31.955
So to quickly summarize,
what is it all about?

00:13:32.285 --> 00:13:37.835
Money is a tool for exchange accounting,
storing value, and deferred payments.

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:41.225
While banking is the business
of handling that money.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.570
Why do we need them to make
economic transactions smooth?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:51.630
Enable savings and investment, maintain
financial stability and control inflation.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.340
When are they applied?

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.010
They are used daily in all transactions.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:14:01.355
Adjusted during economic cycles and
called upon whenever individuals

00:14:01.355 --> 00:14:05.555
or businesses need financial
services, where are they used?

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:10.085
They are used in all markets,
financial institutions, and by

00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.005
central banks all over the world.

00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:13.565
Who uses them?

00:14:13.835 --> 00:14:16.985
Pretty much everyone,
individuals, businesses.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.660
Governments, central banks and financial
institutions, and how are they applied?

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.140
Money is applied through
currency and digital payments.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.330
While banking is applied through taking
deposits, lending money, and financial

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
regulation fully worked out examples.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.890
All right, let's put this knowledge
to the test with some examples.

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:41.790
Example, one question.

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:45.959
Which of the following is not
a primary function of money?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.449
A medium of exchange.

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:50.670
B, unit of account.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.949
C. Store of value, D. Source
of capital for businesses.

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:59.084
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:15:03.765 --> 00:15:04.905
Let's break it down.

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:08.715
Step one is to understand
the core functions of money.

00:15:09.135 --> 00:15:13.245
The primary functions are to be
a medium of exchange, a unit of

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.465
account, and a store of value.

00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:18.465
These are the universally accepted roles.

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:24.885
Step two is to evaluate each option
A, B, and C are the fundamental

00:15:24.885 --> 00:15:26.385
functions we just listed.

00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:31.795
But look at D source of capital
for businesses while banks, which

00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:33.985
use money do provide capital.

00:15:34.285 --> 00:15:37.045
Money itself isn't a source of capital.

00:15:37.045 --> 00:15:41.875
In the same direct way capital is
formed through savings and investment,

00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:45.865
which money helps with, but it's
not a direct function of money.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.740
So in step three, we identify
that D is the one that is not

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.750
a primary function answer.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.780
D example two question.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:02.380
If the reserve Bank of India RBI increases
the repo rate, what is the likely

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.750
immediate impact on commercial banks?

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.410
A, their cost of borrowing
from RBI decreases.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:12.075
B, they will have more liquidity to lend.

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:17.925
C. Their cost of borrowing from
RBI increases D. They will be

00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:20.265
encouraged to lend more to the public.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:23.505
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:29.865
First, what is the repo rate?

00:16:30.225 --> 00:16:33.915
It's the rate at which commercial
banks borrow from the RBI.

00:16:34.275 --> 00:16:36.315
It's a key tool for the RBI.

00:16:36.645 --> 00:16:39.585
Now let's analyze the
effect of an increase.

00:16:40.035 --> 00:16:44.895
When the RBI increases the repo
rate, it means banks have to pay more

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:47.205
interest when they borrow from the RBI.

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:49.349
So what's the immediate impact?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.760
This directly means a higher cost
of funds for commercial banks.

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:57.060
It becomes more expensive
for them to get liquidity.

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:58.979
Now, let's check the options.

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.920
A is wrong, the cost increases.

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:03.060
B is wrong.

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:06.929
Higher costs might reduce their
borrowing and thus liquidity.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:11.790
C says their cost of borrowing
increases, which is exactly right.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.800
D is also wrong.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.960
Because higher borrowing costs for banks
usually lead to higher lending rates for

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.020
the public, which discourages borrowing
answer C. Example three question.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.190
Which of the following is a primary
function of a commercial bank?

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.620
A, issuing currency notes.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.620
B, acting as a banker to the government.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.620
C. Accepting deposits from the public.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.530
D. Formulating monetary policy, understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.360
Okay.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.230
For this one, we need to remember
the different roles of commercial

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.760
banks and the Central bank.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.889
Let's evaluate the options.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.650
Option A issuing currency notes is a
job for the RBI, not commercial banks.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.260
Option B, acting as a banker to
the government is also a primary

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.930
function of the RBI option D.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.160
Formulating monetary policy is
the exclusive job of the RBI.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.960
That leaves us with option C
accepting deposits from the public.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.610
This is the absolute core and primary
function of a commercial bank.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.950
They collect savings from everyone.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.980
So that's our answer, answer, see.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.940
Thank you.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.590
See you in the next lecture.
