00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on types of money

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.370
and measures of money supply.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.360
In 10 minutes from now, you'll understand
this concept better than most people do.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.570
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.300
So what is this thing we call money?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
It's basically anything that
everyone agrees to accept as payment.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.150
Think about it.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.140
It saves us from the chaos of
a double coincidence of wants.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.120
Imagine trying to trade your programming
skills for a plate of biani money.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960
Makes it simple.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.375
It serves three main functions.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:38.445
First, as a medium of exchange, it's
the middleman in every transaction.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.585
You sell something for money, then
use that money to buy what you want.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:43.365
Simple.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.005
Second, it is a unit of account.

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:49.335
It gives us a common
ruler to measure value.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:53.565
A car costs five LAC rupees
and a bike costs one lac.

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:58.004
So we know the car is five times
more valuable, no confusion.

00:00:58.364 --> 00:01:00.614
And third, it's a store of value.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.505
You can save money today
to spend it tomorrow.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:09.235
Yes, gold and property also store value,
but money is the most liquid of them all.

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:10.975
You can use it instantly.

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:12.825
Types of money.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:15.705
Now, money has had quite a journey.

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:18.015
It started as commodity money.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:21.045
This is money with its
own intrinsic value.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:26.295
Think of gold, silver, or in
ancient times, even salt and cattle.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.695
The item itself was valuable.

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:32.235
Then came fiat money,
which is what we use today.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:38.235
Your 500 ruppe note has no real value as
paper, but the government says it's legal

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:40.695
tender, and we all trust that decree.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:44.915
Its value comes from our collective
faith and the government's order.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.165
Next is fiduciary money.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:51.035
This runs purely on trust
between the payer and payee.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:55.475
It's not legal tender, but we accept
it because we have confidence.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:59.495
Your checks and the balance in
your savings account, your demand

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.415
deposits are perfect examples.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:06.275
Finally, we have the new kid on the
block, digital money or E-money.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.545
This is money that lives
only in the digital world.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.910
Zipping around through computer networks.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.130
Think of your UPI and wallet transactions
on pay TM or Google Pay and even

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.140
your debit or credit card swipes.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.209
Measures of money supply.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.910
The Reserve Bank of India, our financial
headmaster, keeps a close watch on the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.220
total money circulating in the economy.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.080
They use different measures sorted
by how easily they can be turned

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.270
into cash or their liquidity.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.650
Let's look at them.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.210
First is M zero.

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:43.234
Also known as Reserve Money
or high Powered Money.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:48.125
This is the most liquid, the base
money created by the RBI itself.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.685
It includes currency and circulation
with both the public and banks

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:57.454
plus bankers, deposits with the RBI
and other deposits with the RBI.

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.665
Then comes M1 or Narrow Money.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.114
This is the money that's
ready for immediate action.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:05.375
Its components are.

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:09.864
Currency with the public demand
deposits with commercial banks, like

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:14.575
current and savings account balances,
and those other deposits with the RBI.

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:16.465
Then comes M two.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:21.355
It's simply M1 plus the savings
deposits held in post office savings.

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:23.845
Banks a bit broader, a bit less liquid.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.260
The most famous one is
M three or broad money.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.560
This is the measure most
commonly used in India.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.020
It's calculated as M1 plus the time
deposits with commercial banks, like your

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.420
fixed deposits and recurring deposits.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.990
And finally, the broadest
of them all M four.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
This includes everything in M three
plus all deposits with post office

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.230
savings organizations, but excluding
national savings certificates.

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:58.385
So the liquidity hierarchy is M zero
is greater than M1, which is greater

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:03.035
than M two, M three, and finally
M four, which is the least liquid.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.280
Real world relevance.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.220
Why does this matter to
a banking professional?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.420
It's crucial.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.830
Understanding money supply helps
you analyze the economy's liquidity,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.250
which affects credit availability
and lending interest rates.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.990
Changes in these s give you insights
into the banking sector's health.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.750
Helping you spot risks and opportunities.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
It's also vital for formulating
credit policies and managing reserves.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.300
And of course, you need to know
this stuff for regulatory compliance

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.099
to keep the central bank happy.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.380
Breakdown of question types.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.590
Let's decode the mind of
the paper setter for your.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.915
Questions on this topic
usually come in four flavors.

00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:49.115
About 30% are definition
and concept-based questions.

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:55.085
Testing your basic understanding of what
fiat money is or what M1 represents the

00:04:55.085 --> 00:05:00.245
most common type at around 40% frequency
are component identification questions.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.570
They'll ask you what's in or
out of M three, for example.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.800
You might also get calculation
based questions, which make up

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.440
about 20% of the problems here.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.390
They give you the numbers and ask
you to calculate M1 or M three, and

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.070
finally, about 10% are implication
and relationship based questions.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.980
Exploring how a change in money supply
affects things like inflation or

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.950
interest rates, formulas and tricks.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.470
Here are the formulas you must know.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.440
M zero is currency in circulation, plus
bankers, deposits with RBI plus other

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.720
deposits with RBI M1 equals currency
with public plus demand deposits

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.240
with banks, plus other deposits with
RBIM two is just M1 plus savings

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.045
deposits of post office savings banks.

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:56.315
M three is M1 plus time deposits
with banks, and M four is M three

00:05:56.405 --> 00:06:00.635
plus all deposits with post office
savings organizations excluding

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:02.224
national savings certificates.

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:03.815
Here's a simple trick.

00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:07.715
Just remember the liquidity
order from most to lease liquid.

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:12.429
M zero greater than M1, greater
than M two, greater than M

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:13.989
three, greater than M four.

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.260
And remember, M1 is narrow money, and M
three is broad money methods of solving.

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:25.000
So how do you tackle these problems
for identifying types of money?

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:26.200
Read the scenario.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.960
Does it have its own value like gold?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.250
It's commodity money.

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:32.799
Is it government declared legal tender?

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:33.940
It's fiat money.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:35.675
Is it based on trust?

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:36.965
It's fiduciary money.

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:38.975
Is it purely electronic?

00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:40.145
It's digital money.

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:45.185
Categorize it based on the best
fit for calculating the S. First.

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:47.045
Identify which measure you need.

00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:49.685
List the components given in the question.

00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:51.815
Refer to the exact formula.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.995
Pick only the required
components and sum them up.

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:59.285
Be careful not to double count
anything, especially since M

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.685
three already contains all of M1.

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:05.415
Shortcuts and smart
techniques to be faster.

00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:10.665
Use component mapping quickly jot down
which component belongs to which M.

00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:13.305
This quick recall is a time saver.

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:15.915
Also use the liquidity ladder.

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:21.015
Understanding that liquidity
decreases from M zero to M four helps

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.875
eliminate wrong answers quickly.

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:26.295
And here's a pro tip focus on M three.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.550
In most exams, M three is the star layer.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.770
Know its components by heart.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.710
Finally, use the elimination strategy.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.295
If you're not sure, rule out the
options that are clearly wrong.

00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:41.835
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:44.955
All right, let's talk
about the common pitfalls.

00:07:45.284 --> 00:07:47.025
A huge one is confusing.

00:07:47.054 --> 00:07:52.335
M1 and M three people often
add time deposits to M1 don't.

00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:57.224
M1 is about demand deposits,
time deposits belong in M three.

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.344
Another point of confusion
is post office deposits.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:06.260
Remember, M two includes only savings
deposits from post offices, while M

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.590
four includes all of them except nscs
friends also mix up M zero and M1.

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.960
M zero is reserve money.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.390
The base money M1 is narrow money
focusing on what the public can spend.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.349
Also, don't assume all
digital money is M1.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.640
It depends on what it's linked
to, and please don't ignore

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.352
the other deposits with RBI.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.695
It might be small, but it's
part of both M zero and M1.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.469
WH framework summary.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.390
Let's summarize this quickly.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.010
What is it all about?

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:41.880
Money.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.540
A universally accepted medium
of exchange and money supply

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.040
measures that quantify it.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.689
Why is it important?

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.680
It's essential for economic
analysis, monetary policy,

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.449
and understanding inflation.

00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:55.949
When is it applied?

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.630
When assessing liquidity, setting
interest rates, or analyzing the banking

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.910
sector's health, where is it used?

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:08.155
In central banks, financial markets,
and commercial banking, who uses it?

00:09:08.485 --> 00:09:12.505
Central banks like the RBI
economists and policy makers.

00:09:12.895 --> 00:09:17.485
And how is it calculated by summing
up specific components of currency and

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:20.005
deposits as the central bank defines.

00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.525
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:24.535
Let's work through an example.

00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:25.555
Example.

00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:31.825
One question given the following data
in Crow rupees, errancy with the public.

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:36.895
15,000 demand deposits with
commercial banks, 25,000.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:39.475
Time deposits with commercial banks.

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:44.605
40,000 other deposits
with RBI 500 bankers.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:46.945
Deposits with RBI 8,000.

00:09:47.335 --> 00:09:55.765
Calculate M1 and M 3:00 AM one equals
40,500 crows M three equals 80,500.

00:09:55.765 --> 00:10:01.555
Crows BM one equals 40,000 crows
M three equals 80,000 crows.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:11.600
CM one equals 48,500 crows and three
equals 88,500 Crows DM one equals 25,500

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.110
crows and three equals 65,500 crows.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.295
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:21.435
All right, let's solve this.

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:24.825
Step one, let's find
the components for M1.

00:10:25.215 --> 00:10:30.165
M1, or narrow money includes currency
with the public demand, deposits with

00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:35.835
commercial banks and other deposits
with RBI, step two, we calculate M1.

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:42.945
That's 15,000, plus 25,000 plus
500, which gives us 40,500 crows.

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:46.725
So M1 is Rupees, 40,500 crows.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:53.650
Now for step three, the components of M
three, M three or broad money is simply M1

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.020
plus time deposits with commercial banks.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.600
Step four, we calculate M three.

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:03.490
That's our calculated M1 of
40,500 crows plus the given

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.740
time deposits of 40,000 crows.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.250
The total is 80,500 crows, so N
three is Rupees, 80,500 crows.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:16.405
Comparing this to our options,
we see that option A is a

00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:18.535
perfect match, correct answer.

00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:21.325
A example two question.

00:11:21.655 --> 00:11:24.955
Which of the following
best describes fiat money?

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.975
A money that has intrinsic
value like gold coins.

00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:33.175
B, money accepted based on
trust, like a personal check.

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:38.455
C. Money declared as legal tender by
government decree without intrinsic value.

00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:44.755
D money that exists only in electronic
form like cryptocurrency understand the

00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:47.095
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.275
Let's break this down.

00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:50.235
Step one.

00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:52.755
Recall the definition of fiat money.

00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:53.955
Its currency.

00:11:53.955 --> 00:11:57.915
A government has declared as legal
tender, but it isn't backed by

00:11:57.915 --> 00:11:59.955
a physical commodity like gold.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:03.525
Its value comes from
government order and our trust.

00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.375
Step two, let's evaluate the options.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.030
Option A describes commodity money.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.760
Option B describes fiduciary money.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.230
Option C, money declared as
legal tender by government decree

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.130
without intrinsic value is a
textbook definition of fiat money.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.830
Option D describes digital money, so
step three, we conclude that option

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.840
C is the most accurate description.

00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:31.665
Correct answer C. Example three question.

00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:36.555
Which of the following measures of money
supply is considered the broadest in terms

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:41.145
of its components and represents the least
liquid form among the standard measures?

00:12:41.324 --> 00:12:50.535
M zero, M1, M two, M three, M 4:00
AM, zero B, M1 C, and three DM four?

00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:53.834
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.080
Okay.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.920
For the final question, step
one, understand the question.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.280
It's asking for the broadest
and least liquid measure.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.140
Broadest means it includes the most
assets and least liquid means it's the

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.270
hardest to convert to instant cash.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.240
Step two, recall the liquidity hierarchy.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.380
We discussed the order from most
liquid and narrowest to least

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.510
liquid and broadest is M zero.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.740
M1, M two, M three and M four.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.900
Step three is to identify the broadest and
least liquid measure from this hierarchy.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.420
Clearly M four, which includes M three
plus all post office deposits, is the

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.340
broadest and least liquid of the lot.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.560
Therefore, comparing our options in
step four, we find that DM four is

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.290
the correct answer, correct answer, D.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.100
Thank you.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.355
See you in the next lecture.
