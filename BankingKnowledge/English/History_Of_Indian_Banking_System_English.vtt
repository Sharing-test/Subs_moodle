Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on history of Indian banking system.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.550
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.580
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.300
Explanation.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
The story of Indian banking is
like a big dramatic Bollywood

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.500
movie full of twists and turns.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.180
Understanding this evolution is
absolutely essential if you want

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.590
to make a career in banking.

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:30.244
Historically, we can slice this
story into a few key phases.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:32.824
Let's start with the early phase.

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:39.185
Pre 1947, before the British arrived with
their fancy banks, we had our own system.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:40.745
Indigenous bankers.

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:44.254
The Mahas and Saints were
the original FinTech guys.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:49.715
They lent money and used ndis, which were
basically old school bills of exchange.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.415
Then came the British East India
Company, and they established the first

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.755
modern banks, the presidency, banks.

00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:02.545
These were the Bank of Calcutta in 1806,
which soon became the Bank of Bengal

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:09.535
in 1809, followed by the Bank of Bombay
in 1840 and the Bank of Madras in 1843.

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:12.475
These three were the big
bosses of their time.

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:18.715
Alongside them, several joint stock banks
popped up like Ala Habad Bank in 1865.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.800
But a special mention goes to Punjab
National Bank from 1894, the first bank

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.280
that was purely managed by Indians, a
true SW dei moment in 1921, the three

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.259
presidency banks were merged to create a
giant called the Imperial Bank of India.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.030
This bank was a jack of all trades,
doing both commercial banking and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.009
acting like a mini central bank,
but the real boss arrived in 1935,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.470
the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.860
It was set up based on the Hilton
Young Commission's ideas and took

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.810
over all central banking duties.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.690
Of course, it was nationalized in 1949 to
become a fully government owned entity.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.880
Next came the post independence
phase 1947 to 1991.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.509
After independence, the government
was in a nation building mood.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.250
In 1955, the Imperial Bank of India
was nationalized and given a new,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.990
very familiar name, the State Bank
of India or SBI, making it the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.090
country's largest public sector bank.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.340
But the real drama happened in
1969, the India Gandhi government

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.799
nationalized 14 major commercial banks.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.480
The goal was to align banking with
socialist ideals, focusing on what

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.490
we call priority sector lending.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.510
Basically making sure farmers
and small industries got loans.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.070
They weren't done yet.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.720
In 1986, more commercial banks
were nationalized, tightening the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.300
government's grip to serve our villages.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.510
Regional rural banks or RBS were set
up in 1975 to push credit and banking

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.490
into rural and semi-urban India.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.200
Then came the big shift,
the reform phase post 1991.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.060
Following the 1991 economic
liberalization, it was clear the banking

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.980
sector needed a serious makeover.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.400
The nursing home committee in 1991 and
1998 recommended huge reforms to make

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.650
banks more efficient and competitive.

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.415
Key suggestions included lowering the
statutory liquidity ratio and cash

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:26.315
reserve ratio, allowing new private
sector banks to enter the market,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:30.635
giving public sector banks more
freedom and improving asset quality.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:34.985
This led to the entry of new
private players like I-C-I-C-I Bank,

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:39.030
HTFC, bank and Access Bank, which
really spiced up the competition.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.630
We also saw mergers of public sector banks
and a massive shift towards technology

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.420
with ATM's, internet and mobile banking.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.079
Finally, the recent
developments 21st century.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.380
In recent times, we've seen
the introduction of payment

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.799
banks and small finance banks
to boost financial inclusion.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.890
There have been more large scale
mergers of public sector banks to create

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.750
fewer but much stronger banks and to
deal with the headache of bad loans.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.040
The insolvency and bankruptcy
code or IBC was introduced for a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.020
more efficient resolution process.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.760
Real world relevance.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.560
So why is this history lesson important?

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.360
Understanding this evolution shows how
banking has mirrored India's social,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.280
political, and economic journey.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.450
It helps policy makers design
better financial rules by learning

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.340
from past successes and failures.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.840
Historical milestones like nationalization
and the creation of the RBI highlight

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.619
efforts to make banking serve the
people which builds public trust.

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.479
The story also traces the long journey
of financial inclusion, taking banking

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.190
from the cities to the villages.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.169
Many of our current banking practices are
direct results of these historical events.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.340
The lessons from the past guide,
future planning, helping us prepare for

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.739
technological changes and global trends.

00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:01.979
For any friend here, it provides
context to understand banking's

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.989
role in building our nation, and it
encourages innovation, but with the

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:09.000
wisdom of historical perspective.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.090
Next came the breakdown of question types.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.570
Now for your exam, how will
they test you on this topic?

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:19.650
Based on past patterns, questions
fall into a few categories.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.969
About 40% are direct factual
questions, asking for specific

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.619
dates, names, or events.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.540
Then 25% are chronological order
questions where you have to arrange

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.310
events in the correct sequence.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.320
Around 20% are reasoning or impact
questions, testing your understanding

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520
of why something happened like
nationalization and what its effects were.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.460
And the remaining 15% are definition or
concept-based questions, asking what terms

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.560
like presidency, banks actually mean.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.010
Key facts and memorization aids.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.010
All right, time for a
rapid fire round lock.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.520
These in.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.840
The first bank in India was
the Bank of Hindustan in 1770.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.610
The presidency banks merged in
1921 to form the Imperial Bank.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.610
RBI was established in 1935.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.700
RBI was nationalized in 1949.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.320
The Imperial Bank was nationalized
to become SBI in 1955.

00:06:15.724 --> 00:06:20.585
The first big bank nationalization
of 14 banks was in 1969, and the

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:23.255
second one of six banks was in 1980.

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:27.875
And the game changing banking reforms
were led by the Naim Home Committee

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.000
approach to studying history.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.300
So how do you study this without
your brain turning to mush?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.270
Focus on the narrative, the story.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.540
Create a mental timeline of major events.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.700
Group them into phases like pre
independence, the nationalization era,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.610
and the reform era for every event,
understand its purpose and its impact.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.630
And please note down the names
of important committees like

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.230
Nurse Sim Hum and Hilton Young,
and what they recommended.

00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:03.645
Memory techniques to
make these facts stick.

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:05.415
Try drawing a timeline.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:08.205
Use flashcards for dates and names.

00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:13.245
You can even create silly acronyms
on mnemonics, or better yet,

00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:16.770
try to tell the entire story
of Indian banking to a friend.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.200
If you can explain it,
you've understood it.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.140
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.850
Now, a word of caution, a very
common mistake is mixing up

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.440
the nationalization dates.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.610
Don't confuse.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.300
1969 with 1980 or RBI's.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.282
Nationalization in 1949 with SBIs in 1955.

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:43.895
Also don't give RBI's powers
to the Imperial Bank before

00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:49.355
1935, and most importantly,
understand the why behind events.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:55.085
Nationalization was for social goals
and reforms were for efficiency, and

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:59.525
please don't forget, the original
bankers are indigenous heroes.

00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:02.265
WWE framework summary.

00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:05.685
Let's summarize this with
a quick WWE framework.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:06.705
What is it?

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:11.354
It's the evolution and development
of banking in India over centuries.

00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:12.885
Why do we study it?

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:17.474
To understand the current structure
and challenges of our financial sector.

00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:22.094
When did it happen From the late
18th century, right up to today?

00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:23.169
Where did it happen?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.880
Across all of India with major
policies coming from Mumbai and

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.890
Delhi, who were the key players?

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:35.980
The British Indian entrepreneurs, the RBI,
various governments and private companies.

00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:41.829
And how did it all happen through new
banks laws, nationalization and economic

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:44.935
reforms, fully worked out examples.

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:47.680
All right, let's solve some questions.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.579
Example, one question.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.360
Which of the following was the
first bank established in India?

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.099
A bank of Bengal.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:03.180
B. Bank of Hindustan C. General Bank of
India d Allahabad Bank understand the

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.115
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.079
Solution.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:11.910
Step one, the question asks for the
very first bank set up in India.

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:17.339
Step two, let's rewind our mental clock
to the earliest days of modern banking.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.360
Step three.

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:23.069
Bank of Bengal was a presidency
bank, but not the first bank of

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:26.280
Hindustan was set up way back in 1770.

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:33.555
General Bank of India came later in
1786 and Ahaha Bank was from 1865.

00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:39.344
Step four, clearly Bank of Hindustan
wins the first prize, correct answer B.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.270
Example, two question in which
here were 14 major commercial

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:54.750
banks in India, nationalized
a 1949 B, 1955 C, 1969 D 1980.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.400
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.020
Step one, the question is about
the nationalization of 14 banks.

00:10:04.199 --> 00:10:07.020
Step two, we know there
were two big phases.

00:10:07.275 --> 00:10:09.555
The first one involved, 14 banks.

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:10.515
Step three.

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:14.325
That first major move was made in 1969.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:17.445
The second one for six banks was in 1980.

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:22.635
Step four, so the year we are
looking for is 1969, correct

00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:26.155
answer c. Example three question.

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:31.225
The Reserve Bank of India RBI was
established based on the recommendations

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:34.195
of which commission A, Qari commission.

00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:34.765
B.

00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:37.525
Hilton Young Commission, c Hum.

00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:41.935
Committee D Aria Commission
understand the question before

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:44.545
moving to explanation solution.

00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:48.685
Step one, the question wants to
know which commission recommended

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:50.335
the creation of the RBI.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.170
Step two, we need to connect the RBI's
birth to its founding commission.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.000
Step three, the Hilton Young Commission
also called the Royal Commission on

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.100
Indian Currency and Finance was the one
that said India needs a central bank.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.060
Step four.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.650
Let's check the other options.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.324
Qari Commission was for education.

00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:14.915
Naim ham committee was for banking
reforms in the nineties, and Saria

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:17.194
commission was for center state relations.

00:11:17.464 --> 00:11:19.145
They are all irrelevant here.

00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:23.104
Step five, so the credit
for RBI's creation goes to

00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:24.545
the Hilton Young Commission.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.275
Correct answer B. Thank you.

00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:29.135
See you in the next lecture.
