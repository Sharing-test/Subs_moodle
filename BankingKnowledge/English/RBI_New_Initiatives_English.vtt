00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on RBI new initiatives.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.620
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.785
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:14.895
All right.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.915
Think of the Reserve Bank
of India, our beloved RBI.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.705
As the strict but wise head of the family.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:27.915
For all Indian banks, it's always cooking
up new policies, rules, and tech gadgets

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:32.745
to keep the Indian financial system
strong, stable, and open for everyone.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.849
These new initiatives are not just
random ideas, they are strategic moves.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.760
The RBI takes these steps to keep up
with our fast changing economy, crazy new

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.220
technology and what's happening globally.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.470
This ensures our banking sector
remains robust, efficient, and

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.120
doesn't leave anyone behind.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.010
The goal is to manage money flow,
push for digital payments, protect

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.379
you and me as customers, and even
support eco-friendly projects for any

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.539
friend aspiring to get into banking.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.670
Understanding these initiatives is
absolutely critical as they shape

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.770
the very world you'll be working in.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.530
Real world relevance.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.310
Let's look at some real world
examples to see what I mean.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.510
The upcoming digital banking
channels, authorization directions

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.940
for 2025 are a big deal.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.280
They are RBI's way of ensuring
safer digital banking by controlling

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.385
how third party products are shown
and demanding our clear consent.

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:41.595
This directly changes how banks
design their apps and protect users.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:47.925
Then the Financial Inclusion index
or FI index, this helps track how

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:52.755
well financial services are reaching
every corner of India, showing banking

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.185
professionals where to focus their energy.

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.800
We also have UPI enhancements.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.010
Which now let you deposit cash using
UPI and use your digital wallets

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.900
more freely, making life easier and
boosting digital payments for banks.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.460
On the green side, we have sovereign
green bonds, which help fund

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.990
environmentally friendly projects,
pushing banks towards sustainable goals.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640
There's even a mobile app for the
retail direct scheme, empowering

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.515
regular folks like us to invest
directly in government securities.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.510
And of course, the big one,
the digital Rupe, or CBDC.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.980
This is a whole new form of currency
that could completely change our

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.750
payment systems, meaning banks have to
get ready to handle this new digital

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.810
asset breakdown of question types.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.355
Now, when you sit for your exam.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.125
The questions on these initiatives
usually come in a few flavors.

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:54.925
About 40 to 50% will be
direct fact-based questions.

00:02:55.285 --> 00:03:00.595
These are straightforward asking about
specific features, launch dates, or goals.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.115
For example, a question might be.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.730
What is the primary objective of
the RBI's Retail direct scheme?

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.000
The next type making up 25 to 30% are
conceptual understanding questions.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.899
These check if you grasp the
why behind an initiative.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.935
An example is how does the financial
inclusion index reflect the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.799
deepening of financial inclusion?

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:30.674
Then we have application based
questions about 15 to 20% of the time.

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:34.394
They'll give you a little
story or scenario and ask

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:36.135
how an initiative applies.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:41.385
For instance, a bank wants to launch a
new transactional digital banking channel.

00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:43.545
What is the RBI's requirement?

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:48.255
And finally, the quick and easy
ones acronym or abbreviation

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:50.655
questions, which are five to 10%.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.720
They'll just ask, what does CBDC stand
for in the context of RBI's initiatives?

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.370
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.990
While we don't have mathematical
formulas here, we have some clever

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.670
tricks to remember all this stuff.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.370
First is acronym association.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.829
Just link the name to its purpose,
like UPI for Unified Payments, or

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.110
fi Index for Financial Inclusion.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.120
It's simple, but it works.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.790
Next, use date and ear hooks.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.750
Try to associate major
initiatives with their launch ear.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:28.695
For example, the retail
direct scheme with 2021.

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:31.515
Also practice keyword spotting.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.104
Look for keywords in the question
that point to a specific initiative

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:40.335
like green projects, immediately
making you think of sovereign green

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:46.245
bonds, and most importantly, have a
why and how focus for every single

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:51.765
initiative, you must understand why it
was created and how it actually works.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.810
Methods of solving.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.390
So how do you tackle these questions?

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.170
In the exam hall, the primary
method is direct recall.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.970
For fact-based questions, you just have
to pull the information from your memory.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.330
This needs some good
old-fashioned memorization.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.320
For conceptual questions,
you'll need contextual analysis.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.100
Understand the bigger picture
and the purpose of the initiative

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.390
to figure out the answer.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.390
Don't forget the classic
elimination technique.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.710
In multiple choice questions, if you
are stuck, start by throwing out the

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.539
options that are obviously wrong.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.030
This seriously improves your chances.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.330
Sometimes you'll need
comparative understanding.

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.440
When a question mentions multiple
initiatives, you must be able to

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.430
compare their goals and functions to
pick the right one for the scenario.

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.830
Lastly, there's keyword matching.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.370
Look for specific terms in the
question that are part of an

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.880
initiative's definition to quickly
pinpoint the correct answer.

00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:52.445
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.875
Everyone loves a shortcut, right?

00:05:55.235 --> 00:05:56.915
Here are some smart techniques.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:59.915
Try creating mind maps
for each initiative.

00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:00.845
Visually.

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:05.675
Connecting its name goal, features
and who it helps can be very powerful.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.220
Use flashcards for quick revision
of names, functions, and dates.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.430
Also, try categorization group initiatives
based on their main goal, like digital

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.320
payments, financial inclusion, or green
finance to make them easier to remember.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.115
A very practical tip
is the daily new scan.

00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:28.880
Keep an eye on financial news
to stay updated on any changes.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.400
And finally, the most important one.

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:36.984
Practice MCQs, solve as many multiple
choice questions on RBI initiatives

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:40.525
as you can to get used to the
patterns and improve your speed.

00:06:40.974 --> 00:06:43.344
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:47.185
And now let's talk about
the common traps to avoid.

00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:52.224
A big one is confusing objectives,
like mixing up the purpose

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:54.414
of the digital rupe with UPI.

00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:55.974
They are not the same thing.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.380
Another is getting incorrect dates
or figures wrong, misremembering.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.860
A launch year or a specific
limit can cost you a mark.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.420
Also, be careful about general
versus specific answers.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.330
Don't apply a general banking concept.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.590
When the question is about a
specific RBI rule, please my friend

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.050
avoid using outdated information.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.565
RBI is always updating
things, so stay current.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.979
And finally, don't ignore the nuances.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.960
Pay attention to the small but important
differences between similar sounding

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960
initiatives, WH framework summary.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.770
So to quickly sum it all up,
using a simple framework,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.320
what are RBI new initiatives?

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.525
They are new policies, rules,
and tech from the Reserve Bank.

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:49.115
Why does RBI introduce them to
strengthen our financial system,

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:51.875
promote stability and boost inclusion?

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:53.585
When are they introduced?

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:58.355
All the time Continuously as the
economy and technology evolve.

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:03.775
Where are they applied across the entire
Indian banking and financial sector

00:08:03.924 --> 00:08:06.385
affecting everyone who is involved.

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:11.455
The RBI introduces them, banks
implement them and we the people

00:08:11.455 --> 00:08:13.375
and businesses benefit from them.

00:08:13.674 --> 00:08:17.544
And how are they rolled out through
official rules, policy announcements.

00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:22.854
New technology and awareness
campaigns fully worked out Examples.

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.015
Example, one question.

00:08:25.284 --> 00:08:29.575
The Reserve Bank of India recently
proposed new draft directions for

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:33.804
digital banking channels, which of
the following is a key provision

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:35.694
under these proposed directions.

00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:41.064
Regarding third party products, a banks
are encouraged to display third party

00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:43.194
products to enhance customer choice.

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:48.085
B. Third party products and services
shall not be displayed on bank's

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:53.245
digital banking channels except as
specifically permitted by the RBIC.

00:08:53.455 --> 00:08:56.875
Banks must obtain verbal
consent from customers before

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.495
displaying third party products.

00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:02.635
D. There are no specific restrictions
on displaying third party

00:09:02.635 --> 00:09:04.525
products on digital platforms.

00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:07.885
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:11.695
The question is about the new
draft rules for digital banking,

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:14.485
specifically about third party products.

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:19.615
The whole point of these new directions is
to tighten the rules to protect customers.

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:24.385
So option A, which says banks
are encouraged to display is the

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.155
opposite of the RBI's intent.

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:30.235
Option C suggests verbal
consent, which is too weak.

00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:33.415
RBI requires explicit, documented consent.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.600
Option D claims, there are no specific
restrictions, which is completely false.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.500
Option B perfectly matches
the RBI's proposed rule.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.630
Third party products cannot be displayed
unless the RBI gives specific permission.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.530
Example two.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.780
Question.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.610
The Reserve Bank of India publishes
the financial inclusion index annually.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.300
Which of the following parameters
carries the highest weightage?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.190
In the calculation of this index?

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.130
A, access B Usage.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.280
C. Quality D. Financial literacy.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.260
Understand the question before.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.460
Moving to explanation.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.750
The direct recall question, the
FI index has three main pillars.

00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:19.315
You just need to remember their weightage
is Access has a weightage of 35%.

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:25.465
Quality has a weightage of 20%, and
usage has the highest weightage at 45%.

00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:29.125
Financial literacy is a part
of the quality parameter,

00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:30.955
not a main parameter itself.

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:36.505
Since 45% is the highest usage is
our correct answer, example three.

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:42.074
Question, which recent RBI initiative
allows customers to deposit cash at

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:48.824
cash deposit machines, CDMs in banks
and ATMs using the UPI app, A retail

00:10:48.824 --> 00:10:51.405
direct scheme, B, sovereign Green Bonds.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.910
CUPI enhancements.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.310
D. Liquidity Coverage ratio review.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.490
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.250
The question describes
a very specific action.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.940
Depositing cash at a
machine using a UPI app.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.080
The retail direct scheme is for
investing in government securities.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.150
So that's out.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.740
Sovereign green bonds are for funding,
green projects, also not related.

00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:19.069
The liquidity coverage
ratio is a technical banking

00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:20.689
term about managing funds.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.569
Nothing to do with
customer deposits via UPI.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.839
The correct initiative
is UPI enhancements.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.089
This specific feature, allowing cash
deposits through UPI is one of the recent

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.250
upgrades made to the UPI system to expand
its capabilities beyond just payments.

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:38.150
Thank you.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.740
See you in the next lecture.
