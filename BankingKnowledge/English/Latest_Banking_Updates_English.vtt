00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on latest banking updates.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.280
Think of this as a cheat code
for understanding this concept.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.504
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.115
So what is this big deal about?

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.205
Latest banking updates anyway, array.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.845
It's just a fancy term for all the recent
drama and action in the banking world

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:25.064
that you need to know for your exam.

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:29.354
Think of it as the masala
mix of the financial sector.

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:32.655
This includes new rules from the big boss.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.650
The Reserve Bank of India or
new schemes from the government.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.870
It covers all the cool new technology
like digital payments and FinTech,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.449
changes in financial laws, new plans for
bringing more people into the banking

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.480
system, and even big shot bank mergers.

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:56.655
Knowing this stuff is critical because
it shows you are not living under a rock.

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:01.095
These updates directly affect
how banks work, how they treat

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.915
customers, and the entire economy.

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:08.625
So in your exam, questions on
this topic are basically testing.

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:12.585
If you are ready for a job that
changes faster than Mumbai weather.

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:15.465
Real world relevance.

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:17.385
Now, why should you care?

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:22.635
Practically speaking as an officer, you
won't just be sitting and counting notes.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:27.855
You'll be the one putting these new RBI
guidelines and government schemes into

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.685
action changing how your branch works.

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:35.365
You'll need to advise customers
correctly about new products and digital

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:38.215
services, so you need to be updated.

00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:43.525
Knowing about new regulations helps you
manage financial risks at your branch.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:49.585
Awareness of technology lets you use new
tools to work smarter, not just harder.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.815
You have to make sure your branch
is following all the rules,

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.775
which means you must understand
the latest compliance needs.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.949
And finally being informed helps your
bank stay ahead of the competition.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.750
It's a lot I know.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.800
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.250
Let's look at how they might
try to test your knowledge in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.770
the exam based on past patterns.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.710
The questions are usually
broken down like this.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.690
About 40% are direct fact-based
questions, asking for specific

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.210
names, dates, or policy details.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.160
Another 20% are about acronyms
and full forms, so you better

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.900
know your ABCs of banking.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.420
Then come the slightly trickier ones.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.810
15% are impact or implication
questions where you need to understand

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.850
the so what of a new policy.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.310
Another 15% are who, which
questions asking you to identify

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.090
the correct ministry or institution
behind a new initiative.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.250
And the final 10% are numerical
or statistical data questions

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.960
focusing on key numbers like
GDP growth or inflation targets.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.430
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.110
While there are no math formulas here
we have some jugar for your brain.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.230
For new acronyms, try acronym association
by creating a funny phrase to remember

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.660
the full form for policy changes.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.470
Use timeline mapping to create
a mental sequence of events.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.080
Try keyword linking where you connect
each update to a few core words.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.140
A great trick is the who, what,
when Matrix for every big update,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.250
just ask who announced it, what
it is and when it happened.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.070
Also, try categorization group updates
by themes like digital banking or

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.440
government schemes for organized recall,
and always do an impact analysis.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.269
Ask yourself who benefits and
what is the goal for every update.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.560
Methods of solving.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.090
To solve these questions, you need
to recall information effectively.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.650
Here are some methods.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.330
Use active recall.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.470
After reading, close your book and
try to remember the main points.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.990
Space repetition is your best friend.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.490
Review updates at increasing time
intervals to lock them in your memory.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.950
Always go for contextual learning.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.310
Understand the why behind an
update, not just the what.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.280
This is key for implication
based questions.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.130
Use comparative analysis to compare new
and old policies to spot the differences.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.990
You can also create mind maps to
visually connect different updates and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.240
institutions, and of course, practice
with question answer drills by making

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.070
your own questions from the news.

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:43.625
Shortcuts and smart techniques for
some smart techniques dedicate 15

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:48.305
to 20 minutes daily for a daily news
scan of reliable financial news.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:53.855
Focus heavily on updates from the RBI
and the Ministry of Finance as they are

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:55.955
the most common sources of questions.

00:04:56.375 --> 00:05:00.755
Instead of just learning chronologically,
try theme-based grouping, putting

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:02.825
all digital payment updates together.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:07.775
For example, use flashcards for
quick revision of acronyms and dates.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.179
In multiple choice questions, use the
elimination strategy to remove obviously

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:19.719
wrong answers and always prioritize new
initiatives over revised ones as brand new

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.854
things often get more attention in exams.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.350
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.100
Now let's talk about the
common traps people fall into.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.180
A big one is confusing dates and
figures for different schemes.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.600
Another is getting the full
forms of acronyms wrong.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.770
Be careful about attributing
to the wrong body, like mixing

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.900
up the roles of RBI and sebi.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.780
A huge mistake is overlooking the why.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.500
Focusing only on what an
update is, but not its purpose.

00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:53.195
Don't ignore small details
like a committee name or

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:54.635
a tiny percentage change.

00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:58.715
They love asking about those,
and the biggest blunder is

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:00.785
relying on outdated information.

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:03.125
Always check for the latest changes.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.909
WH framework summary.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.349
So to summarize it all in a
simple framework, what is it?

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.940
It's all the recent developments and
policy changes in the banking sector.

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:19.710
Why does it happen to help banks
adapt, improve efficiency, and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.479
maintain economic stability?

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.880
When does it happen All the time.

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.799
The sector is very dynamic.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.210
Where does it happen?

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.710
Primarily in India, affecting all
our banks and financial markets.

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:33.425
Who are the main players?

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:37.265
The RBI, the government of
India and the banks themselves.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:39.095
And how does it happen?

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:43.685
Through new rules, digital projects,
new schemes, and policy revisions.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.320
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.630
Example, one question.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.340
Which of the following initiatives was
launched by the Reserve Bank of India to

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.560
facilitate small value digital payments
in offline mode using wallets or cards?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.075
A UPI light.

00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:06.545
BE rpe, C-O-N-D-C-D, Digi
Locker understand the question

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.255
before moving to explanation.

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:12.425
The question is asking about
an RBI initiative for small

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.075
offline digital payments.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.845
Let's look at the options.

00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:20.945
UPI LIGHT is designed exactly for
this small payments without internet.

00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:22.805
E rupi is a voucher.

00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:27.035
ONDC is for e-commerce, and
Digi Locker is for documents.

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:29.825
So UPI Light is the clear winner here.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.980
Correct answer.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.820
A UPI Light Example two question.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.680
The Reserve Bank of India recently
introduced the framework for SROs,

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.360
self-regulatory organizations for the
regulated entities of the Reserve Bank.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.300
What is the primary
objective of this framework?

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:53.830
A, to provide direct financial assistance
to struggling N BFCs B, to empower the

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.510
regulated entities to set their own
interest rates without RBI intervention.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.340
C to foster responsible conduct and
discipline among regulated entities

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.719
through peer driven supervision.

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:10.465
D to mandate all regulated entities to
merge with larger public sector banks.

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:15.205
Understand the question before moving
to explanation the question asks for

00:08:15.205 --> 00:08:20.335
The main goal of the SRO framework
and SRO is all about self-regulation.

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:24.985
It's not forgiving money, not for
setting interest rates without RBI and

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.905
definitely not for forcing mergers.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.780
The whole point of an SRO is to get the
industry players to police themselves

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.220
to improve conduct and discipline with
peer supervision that makes option

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.289
C, the perfect fit, correct answer,
C, to foster responsible conduct and

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.800
discipline among regulated entities
through peer driven supervision.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.135
Example three question.

00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:50.825
Which of the following statements
is true regarding the recent

00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:54.905
changes in the definition of micro,
small and medium enterprises?

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:55.595
MSEs?

00:08:55.595 --> 00:09:00.095
In India A, the new definition
is based solely on investment

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:01.295
in plant and machinery.

00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:07.115
Equipment B, both investment and turnover
criteria are now used for classification.

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:12.579
C, the distinction between manufacturing
and services, MSEs has been retained.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:16.239
D, the investment limit
for a micro-enterprise has

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:17.560
been increased to rupees.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.370
20 Crows.

00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:20.140
Understand the question before.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.489
Moving to explanation.

00:09:21.969 --> 00:09:25.180
This one tests your memory of
the MSME definition change.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.730
Let's check the facts.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.780
The old definition was based just
on investment, but the new one

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.120
uses both investment and turnover.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.460
So A is wrong and B is right.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.390
The new definition also removed the
difference between manufacturing

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.550
and services making C incorrect.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.700
And the limit for a micro
enterprise is one, grow

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.920
investment, and five grow turnover.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.420
So D is way off.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.910
The key change was indeed the composite
criteria, correct answer B. Both

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.750
investment and turnover criteria
are now used for classification.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.740
Thank you.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.085
See you in the next lecture.

00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:00.765
I.
