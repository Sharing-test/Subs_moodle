00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
Welcome my friend to today's lecture on
National Payments Corporation of India.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.960
You don't need to be a genius.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.340
Just stay till the end.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.980
You will be an expert in this concept.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.780
Concept, explanation.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.250
So what is this?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.365
National Payments
Corporation of India or NPCI?

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.660
Think of it as the big boss, the
umbrella organization for all the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.050
small time retail payments and
settlements happening in India.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.310
It was brought into existence
by two heavyweights, the Reserve

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.315
Bank of India, A-K-A-R-B-I, and
the Indian Banks Association.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:35.675
Or IBA.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.055
This happened under the legal power
of the Payment and Settlement Systems

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:45.815
act of 2007 with a very clear goal
to build a solid and reliable payment

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:47.705
highway for the entire country.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.805
The whole idea behind NPCI is to
give us a payment system that is

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:55.415
cheap, secure, and super efficient.

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.365
And boy, have they delivered.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.615
They've rolled out a whole suite of
game changing products like UPI, rupe,

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:08.525
I-M-P-S-A-E-P-S, and BARRAT bill Pay
that have completely revolutionized

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.955
how we handle money digitally in India.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.725
Real world relevance.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:19.025
Now you might ask why should iCare
Ah, understanding NPCI is absolutely

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.925
critical because it's the backbone
for most digital transactions.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.245
Your bank handles.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.220
Ensuring everything runs smoothly for
customers and the bank's own operations.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.940
First, it is the very digital
transaction foundation.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
Its role is to support the bulk of
digital transactions, and the impact

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.585
is that it ensures the entire financial
system operates without a hitch.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.665
Second for customer service excellence.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:48.955
Knowing about NPCI Systems
helps bank staff immensely.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:53.815
This knowledge enables them to provide
efficient service and quickly figure out

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.675
what went wrong with the transaction.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:58.555
Third, it helps in an advisory role.

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:03.655
When a staff member understands N PCIs
products, they can expertly advise

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:07.855
customers on the best digital payment
option for their specific needs.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.750
Finally, it aids in problem resolution.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.270
Being familiar with how NPCI systems work
helps in sorting out transaction related

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.370
questions and technical glitches, much
more efficiently breakdown of question

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.580
types based on patterns in a typical exam.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.550
Questions about NPCI
are quite predictable.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.370
They love to test a few key areas.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.930
About 30% of questions will be on full
forms and definitions, asking you to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.170
expand acronyms like U-P-I-I-M-P-S
or A A PS or for their basic meaning.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.170
Another 25% of questions will focus on
its establishment and regulatory body.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.960
Quizzing you on when NPCI was set up
by whom and under which specific act?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.625
The biggest chunk around 35% is dedicated
to its key products and services.

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.285
Here they will ask about the
purpose, features, or any new

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:09.295
updates related to superstars
like UPI, rupe and PAR bill pay.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:16.045
Lastly, a smaller 10% of questions cover
the role and objectives focusing on NP C'S

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:18.505
overall mission in India's payment world.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.709
Key facts and tricks.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.579
All right.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.290
Here are the golden nuggets.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.769
You must remember the full
form is of course, national

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.420
Payments Corporation of India.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.850
It was established in 2008.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.359
It was promoted by the RBI and IBA.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:39.935
The act that gave it life was the
Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:46.130
Its key products include UPI,
Rupe, I-M-P-S-A-E-P-S, barat,

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.484
BillPay, natch, and NETC.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:53.930
And its motto, which is quite nice is
payments for Every Indian Understanding,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.894
N np, C'S Functions, products.

00:03:56.595 --> 00:04:00.614
Let's talk about its blockbuster
products first, the Unified

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.475
Payments Interface, UPI.

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:06.704
This is a real time payment system
that allows for instant money

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.065
transfer between bank accounts
all through your mobile phone.

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:16.125
It lets you send money instantly using
a simple virtual payment address or VPA

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.954
instead of clumsy bank account details.

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:21.665
It works for both person to
person and person to merchant

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:24.155
payments, and is available 24 7.

00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:25.595
Next is Rupe.

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:29.585
This is India's very own
domestic card payment network.

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:35.165
Our answer to Visa or MasterCard, it
offers debit, credit and prepaid cards

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:39.545
all while promoting financial inclusion
with its cost-effective solutions.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:42.900
Then we have the immediate
payment service IMP.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.930
This service provides instant 24 7
interbank fund transfers using your

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.600
mobile internet or even an ATM.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.540
It truly enables realtime money
movement, the AHA enabled payment system.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.900
A EPS is a fantastic bank led model.

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:04.645
It allows for online financial
transactions at a point of

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:08.395
sale machine through a business
correspondent of any bank.

00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:13.765
Using your ADHA for authentication,
you can do things like cash deposits,

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:18.895
withdrawals, balance checks, get a mini
statement, and even transfer funds from

00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:21.115
one ADHA linked account to another.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:25.104
Finally, the Hari bill Pay system BBPS.

00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:30.745
This is an integrated system that offers a
one-stop shop for all your bill payments.

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:34.974
It provides an interoperable
and easily accessible service

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.625
through a network of agents.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:40.974
This means it creates a single
platform for paying all kinds of

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:46.825
bills like electricity, water, gas,
DT, H, and telecom, even for people

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:48.775
who don't have internet access.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.180
Shortcuts and smart techniques to remember
these easily use some simple associations.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.810
For UP, I think Universal
Payments instant.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.840
For Rupe, it's simply rupe payment.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.490
For IMPS, just remember
Instant Money Payment Service.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.490
And for A EPS, it's the AHA enabled
payment system for its timeline.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.650
Just remember the 2007 ACT
led to the 2008 establishment.

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:22.285
And the promoters, the two
big daddies, RBI and IBA.

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.835
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.865
Now, let's clear up some common confusion.

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:30.145
A big mistake is confusing.

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:35.395
NPCI with RBI remember RBI
is the supreme regulator.

00:06:35.515 --> 00:06:40.285
The central bank NPCI, is the
operating body for retail payments,

00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:43.435
which was promoted by RBI and IBA.

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:45.355
Another mistake is believing.

00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:46.675
UPI is a bank.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.870
No UPI is a payment system developed
by NPCI that connects bank accounts.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.550
It's not a bank itself.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.880
People also think repay
is only for debit cards.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.110
That's incorrect.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.590
Repay issues, debit
credit, and prepaid cards.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.660
Lastly, don't assume all digital
payments are handled by one entity.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.420
While NPCI is a giant, other
systems like NEFT and RTGS are

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.490
handled directly by the RBI.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.440
WH framework summary.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.990
So to wrap it all up, what is it?

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.520
The National Payments Corporation
of India, the main organization for

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.530
retail payment systems in India.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.850
Why was it created to build a
strong, secure, and efficient

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.090
payment infrastructure and
to boost digital payments?

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:35.474
When did it start?

00:07:35.804 --> 00:07:38.955
It was established in
2008 under the Payment and

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:41.505
Settlement Systems Act of 2007.

00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:43.005
Where does it operate?

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:48.315
Across all of India making digital
payments easy for citizens and businesses.

00:07:48.674 --> 00:07:50.625
Who are the main parties involved?

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:57.104
It was promoted by RBI and IBA and IT
benefits banks, financial institutions.

00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:00.405
Merchants and of course
the general public.

00:08:00.735 --> 00:08:06.105
And how does it do its job by creating
and running fantastic payment products

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:12.820
like UPI, Rupe, IMPS and a EPS to make
digital transactions smooth as butter.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.510
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.460
Let's try a few questions.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.800
Example, one question.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.380
Which of the following organizations is
the umbrella entity for operating retail

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.599
payments and settlement systems in India?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:35.534
A. Reserve Bank of India, RBIB, securities
and Exchange Board of India sebi C,

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:41.595
national Payments Corporation of India,
N-P-C-I-D, Indian Banks Association.

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:45.735
IBA understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:47.265
Let's break this down.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:52.395
The question is asking for the umbrella
entity for operating retail payments.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.180
You should recall that NPCI was
created specifically for this purpose.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.310
RBI is the regulator.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.620
SEBI handles securities, and
IBA is a bank association, so

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.720
option C is the perfect fit.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.740
Answer C, national Payments
Corporation of India.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.910
Example two.

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:17.949
Question, the Unified payments interface,
UPI is a payment system developed

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:19.870
by which of the following entities?

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.270
A State Bank of India, SBIB,
national Payments Corporation

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:31.060
of India, N-P-C-I-C, ministry of
Finance, D. Reserve Bank of India.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.910
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:37.704
The core of this question
is the product UPI.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.584
You must connect the
product to its developer.

00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:46.405
Remember, UPI is a flagship product,
developed and operated by NPCI.

00:09:46.824 --> 00:09:49.255
While RBI oversees the whole system.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.675
NPCI is the one that built and runs UPI.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:57.385
The other options are a commercial
bank, a government ministry, and

00:09:57.385 --> 00:09:59.334
the central bank, not the developer.

00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:03.355
Answer B, national Payments
Corporation of India.

00:10:03.775 --> 00:10:08.245
Example, three question under
which act was the National Payments

00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:13.615
Corporation of India established
a Banking Regulation Act 1949.

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:17.305
B. Reserve Bank of India Act 1934.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:24.320
C Payment and Settlement Systems
Act 2007 D Companies Act 2013.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.620
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.850
The question wants the specific
act behind NP C'S creation.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.460
You need to recall its foundational law.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.110
The payment and Settlement Systems Act
2007 is the correct legislative framework.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:44.910
The other acts are important, but they
deal with general banking, the central

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.530
bank's, powers, or company laws, not
specifically with creating a payment

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.130
systems body like NPCI Answer C.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.250
Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.240
Thank you.

00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:58.800
See you in the next lecture.
