00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on basal norms.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.850
You don't need to be a genius.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.590
Just stay till the end.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.480
You will be an expert in this
concept, concept, explanation.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.540
So what on earth are these basal norms?

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.645
Think of them as the strict universally
agreed upon rules set by the big boss

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:27.314
of international banking, the Basal
Committee on Banking Supervision, or BCBS.

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:32.625
The main goal, my friend, is to make
sure our banks don't go on a wild

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.505
lending spree without any backup cash.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:40.725
These norms ensure banks have
enough capital a safety net to

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.485
absorb unexpected shocks and losses.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.010
This protects us the depositors and
keeps the whole financial system from

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.510
collapsing like a house of cards.

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:56.205
Now these aren't legally binding
laws that will land a banker in jail.

00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.585
Instead, they are super strong
recommendations that countries,

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:05.325
including our own India, via
the RBI adopt and enforce.

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:07.575
It's like a Bollywood franchise.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:13.815
We had Basil One then came the sequel
Basil two and the Blockbuster Basil three.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.880
Each one upgrading the action to
tackle new financial villains.

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:20.085
Real world relevance.

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:23.625
Now, you might ask, sir, why should iCare?

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.845
Oh, you absolutely should.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:30.975
Understanding basal norms is critical
because it's the backstage drama

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:33.525
that directs the entire banking show.

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:38.804
First, capital adequacy ensures the
bank has enough of its own money,

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:43.065
which directly impacts how much it
can lend you and how healthy it is.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:49.265
Second, it provides a master plan for
risk management, helping banks identify

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:55.685
and control all the scary monsters like
credit market and operational risks For

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.445
the bank's, regulatory compliance is key.

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:02.104
These norms are the
foundation of RBI's Rule book.

00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:04.715
It even affects lending decisions.

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:09.655
The amount of capital a bank has
dictates how generous it can be with

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:12.025
loans and at what interest rates.

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:16.855
Ultimately, this contributes to
overall financial stability, which

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:21.535
is fantastic for the economy and
internally it shapes everything from

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:26.005
the bank's internal checks and audits
to its entire governance structure.

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:28.165
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.260
For your exam, questions on this
topic are quite predictable.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.360
If you know where to look, about
30 to 40% of questions are direct

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.220
definition or concept-based, simply
asking you to define a term or a pillar.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.340
Then 20 to 25% are purpose-based,
focusing on the why behind a norm.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.820
Another 15 to 20% are comparison based.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.900
Asking, what's the difference
between basil one, two, and three?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.910
You'll also see some application-based
questions, maybe 10 to 15%,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.810
where they give you a situation
and ask which rule applies.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.730
A smaller chunk, about five to
10% might be numerical, asking

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.829
for a simple calculation of car.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.730
And finally, a tiny 5%
might be chronology.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.320
Questions about the ears.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.579
These accords were introduced,
so the mix is quite manageable.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.480
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.890
All right, let's get to the juicy
part, the formulas and tricks.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.440
The most important formula is for
the capital adequacy ratio or CAR.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.690
It is total capital, which is tier
one plus tier two capital divided

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.340
by the risk weighted assets, or
RWA, all multiplied by a hundred.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.170
Remember, tier one capital is the
bank's core, high quality capital,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.510
like its own equity and profits.

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:52.905
It's the bank's own hard earned money.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.120
Tier two.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.500
Capital is the supplementary stuff
like reserves and subordinated debt

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.290
and risk weighted assets, or RWA is a
clever concept where a bank's assets

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.480
are weighted by how risky they are.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.650
A loan to the government is less
risky than a personal loan, so

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.210
it gets a lower risk weight.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.950
Here's a trick to remember.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.960
The pillars of basal two and three.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.399
Think of the three Ps. Pillar
one for minimum capital payments.

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:24.735
Pillar two for supervisory review
process and pillar three for public

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:26.565
disclosure or market discipline.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:30.915
And for the evolution, just
remember the three Bs, basil

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.465
one, basil two, and Basil three.

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:34.365
Simple.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.030
Methods of solving.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.610
Now how to solve problems with this?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.150
Let's look at method one, calculating the
capital adequacy ratio First, identify and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.670
add up all tier one capital components.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.000
Second, do the same for
all tier two components.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:55.775
Third, calculate total capital by
adding tier one and two together.

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:59.045
Fourth, determine the
total risk weighted assets.

00:04:59.344 --> 00:05:02.915
This means you multiply each
asset's value by its risk

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:04.625
percentage and sum them all up.

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:07.325
Finally, apply the CAR formula.

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:12.395
Divide your total capital by the
total RWA and multiply by a hundred.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.585
For method two, identifying basal pillars.

00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:18.195
First, read the question very carefully.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.104
Then recall the core
concepts of each pillar.

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:22.484
Look for keywords.

00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:25.335
If you see minimum
capital, it's pillar one.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:30.405
If it talks about supervisory oversight
or regulatory review, that's pillar two.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.344
Shouting at you, and if
it mentions disclosure or

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:35.534
transparency, that's pillar three.

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:37.575
Just match the keyword to the pillar.

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:43.575
Shortcuts and smart techniques want some
smart techniques for pillar association.

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:45.465
Just burn this into your brain.

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:47.385
Pillar one equals capital.

00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:49.275
Pillar two equals supervision.

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:53.385
And pillar three equals disclosure
for the basal evolution.

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:57.765
Just remember this way, basal
one was simple, focusing only

00:05:57.765 --> 00:05:59.625
on credit risk within 8%.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.195
CAR.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:05.065
Basil two got more sophisticated,
adding operational and market risk

00:06:05.185 --> 00:06:06.985
and introducing the three pillars.

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:11.125
Basil three was the big
reaction to the 2008 crisis.

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:15.085
Strengthening capital quality
and introducing new concepts like

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.515
liquidity ratios and a leverage ratio.

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:23.065
A good monic for the risks is COM
Credit, operational and market.

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:25.885
Always ask why for any norm.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:31.075
Understanding the purpose makes it easier
to remember in a multiple choice question.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:35.155
If two options look close, pick
the one that is more complete and

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:37.164
captures the main spirit of the norm.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:39.685
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.560
Let's talk about the common
traps people fall into first.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.930
Don't confuse tier one and tier two.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.850
Capital tier one is core.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.530
Tier two is supplementary.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.200
Second, don't mix up the three pillars.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.910
Their functions are distinct.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.320
A very common mistake is thinking
basal norms are actual laws.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.370
They are not.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.480
They are recommendations which
national regulators, like RBI

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.310
turn into mandatory rules.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.140
Also, don't forget about risk weights.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.390
Not all assets are equal, and please
don't overlook liquidity and leverage.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.140
Basal three made a huge deal
about these, and they are separate

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.850
from just capital adequacy.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.770
Finally, remember the Indian context,
the RBI implements these norms

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.340
with its own specific requirements,
which are crucial for your exam.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.910
W framework summary.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.290
So to summarize it all in a
flash, what are basal norms?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.160
They are international banking
regulations for financial stability.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.650
Why do we have them to prevent banking
crises and ensure banks can handle losses?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.120
When did they happen?

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.039
Basil 1 19 88.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.820
Basil two, 2004 and Basil three, 2010.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.950
With updates always coming, where are
they Applied globally by central banks.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.120
Who is involved?

00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:00.539
All banks, central banks
and financial regulators.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.919
And how do they work?

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.570
By setting strict standards for capital
risk management and supervision.

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:08.775
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:11.355
All right, let's solve some examples.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.575
Example, one question.

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:18.885
A bank has tier one capital of 500
crow and tier two capital of 200 crow.

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:22.455
Its total risk weighted
assets are 7,000 crow.

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:25.185
What is the bank's capital adequacy ratio?

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:26.715
A 8%.

00:08:26.895 --> 00:08:28.095
B, 10%.

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.680
C, 12% D 15%.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.089
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:36.250
Okay, let's do the math.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.890
Step one, calculate total capital.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.380
That's tier one plus tier two, so
500 plus 200 equals 700 crow rupees.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.040
Step two RWA is given as 7,000 crow.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.960
Step three, apply The formula CAR is
total capital divided by RWA times

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.010
hundred, so 700 divided by 7,000 in 200.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.480
That's 0.1 times hundred,
which gives us 10% easy.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:02.930
Pingley.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.570
The correct answer is B. Example.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.890
Two question.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.270
Which pillar of basal two or three
primarily focuses on the minimum

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.800
capital requirements for banks covering
credit, operational and market risks?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.830
A Pillar one B, pillar two C, pillar 3D.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.520
Pillar four.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.580
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.960
Let's break it down.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.310
Remember our three Ps pillar one
is minimum capital requirements.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.290
Pillar two is supervisory review.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.240
Pillar three is market discipline.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.020
The question asks about minimum
capital requirements for credit,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.970
operational and market risks.

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:41.810
That is the exact
definition of pillar one.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.560
So the correct answer is A,
there is no pillar four, by the

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.420
way, that's just to confuse you.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.670
Example three question.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.060
Basal three introduced several
new measures to strengthen

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.590
the global banking framework.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.130
Which of the following was a
key focus area introduced or

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.324
significantly enhanced by basal three?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.820
A only credit risk management.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.470
B. Introduction of the concept
of tier one, capital C. Focus on

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.180
liquidity and leverage ratios.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.030
D. Reducing the minimum CAR requirement.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.090
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.100
Let's think about the evolution.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.320
Basal one was about credit risk.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.150
Basal two expanded on that.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.085
Basil three was a direct response
to the 2008 financial crisis.

00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:29.045
Option A is wrong because
Basil three was much broader.

00:10:29.345 --> 00:10:33.545
Option B is wrong because tier one
capital was a concept from Basil one.

00:10:33.814 --> 00:10:35.585
Option D is completely wrong.

00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:38.585
Basil three actually increased
capital requirements.

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:42.875
Option C, focus on liquidity and
leverage ratios is the bullseye.

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:47.915
