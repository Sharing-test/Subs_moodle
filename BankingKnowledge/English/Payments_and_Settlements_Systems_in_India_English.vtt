00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome my friend to today's lecture on
payments and settlement systems in India.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.560
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.530
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.495
So what on earth are these
payments and settlement systems?

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.635
Think of it as the pluming system
of India's financial world.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:27.615
Seriously, when you buy that fancy new
phone online, send some pocket money

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:31.545
to your younger sibling or pay your
electricity bill at the last minute.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.805
These systems are the pipes that
make sure your money moves safely.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:41.355
And efficiently from your bank account to
the recipients, it's the entire process

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:43.755
and infrastructure for transferring money.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:48.645
These systems use everything from
old school paper checks to the modern

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:54.735
digital magic of N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S, and
of course everyone's favorite UPI.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.110
The big boss here is the
Reserve Bank of India or RBI.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.030
They act as the master regulator
overseeing everything to ensure it's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.250
secure, efficient, and reliable.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.720
This is crucial for keeping our
country's financial stability in check.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.009
In simple terms, it's all about
how your transactions are completed

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:19.150
and how the final money transfer
between accounts actually happens.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.720
Real world relevance.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.770
Understanding this financial
plumbing is absolutely vital

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.600
for anyone in a banking role.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.290
Why?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.120
Well, first, to facilitate customer
transactions you need to ensure

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.465
their payments and fund transfers
are processed without a hitch.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:41.685
You must also manage operational
risks, which means identifying and

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.255
mitigating the dangers that come
with different payment channels.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:49.635
You'll also be expected to advise
on digital solutions guiding

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:53.775
customers to the best digital payment
method for their specific needs.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.975
And you cannot forget ensuring
regulatory compliance by

00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:00.165
sticking to all RBI guidelines.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:04.085
Plus a sharp eye for detecting
and preventing fraud is

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:08.195
needed, which means recognizing
suspicious transaction patterns.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.485
All this adds up to enhancing
the customer experience by giving

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:17.075
accurate information about transaction
statuses and solving any issues.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.770
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.690
Now for your exam.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.840
The questions on this topic
follow a predictable pattern.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.090
A huge chunk about 40% will be
definition of feature-based questions.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.550
They'll ask for the definition of terms
like RTGS or UPI or their features

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.740
like limits and operating hours.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:43.175
Then about 25% of questions are comparison
based, where you have to explain the

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:46.415
difference between say, NEFT and RTGS.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.975
Around 15% of questions are
regulatory body-based, focusing on

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:54.065
the role of giants like RBI or NPCI.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:58.775
Another 10% will be on recent
developments, so keep an eye out

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.785
for new policies or technologies.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.859
And the last 10% are clever scenario
based questions, giving you a short

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.220
story where you have to pick the
best payment system for the job.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.245
Formulas and tricks for this topic.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:16.785
Our formulas are really
just key facts and acronyms.

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:19.575
Let's make some simple
tricks to remember them.

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:23.745
First up, NEFT National
Electronic Funds Transfer.

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:28.665
The trick is N for net, as in
it uses net or batch processing,

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.065
and no minimum or maximum limit.

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:32.865
And it's 24 7.

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:34.035
Next RTGS.

00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:36.255
Real time gross settlement.

00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:41.834
The trick here is R for real time
processing and R for rupees to lack.

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:44.204
Minimum limit also 24 7.

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:49.665
Then there's UPI, unified Payments
Interface Think U for Unified,

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:53.685
A single interface for many
bank accounts and I for instant.

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:55.725
Don't forget IPA's.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:04:00.225
Immediate payment service I
for immediate and M for mobile

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:01.755
as it's heavily used there.

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:03.015
Also 24 7.

00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.165
We also have Natch National
Automated Clearinghouse.

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:13.105
Here N is for national, a centralized
system, and A is for automated, perfect

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:15.084
for recurring payments like emis.

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:19.015
Finally, a EPS AHA Enabled Payment System.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:22.855
Just remember A for AHA using biometrics.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.080
Methods of solving.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.330
The key to mastering this is to understand
the core characteristics of each system.

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.000
First, understand the
nature of settlement.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.050
Differentiate between gross, which
is individual and realtime, like

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.900
RTGS and net, which is batched and
deferred like any FT next for each

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.469
system, be it N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S-U-P-I.

00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:51.955
IMPS natch or even the check truncation
system, you must know its key features.

00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:57.054
Note down the minimum and maximum limits
operating hours processing mechanism,

00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:59.965
main purpose, and how you can initiate it.

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:05.185
Also, you must identify the regulatory
bodies know which system is run by

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:10.405
RBI and which by NPCI try to trace
the transaction flow in your mind.

00:05:10.674 --> 00:05:15.054
Finally, be aware of the pros and cons
of each system for different needs.

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.490
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.190
Here are some smart
techniques to get ahead.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.460
First, categorize by speed group systems
into instant, like R-T-G-S-I-M-P-S

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.890
and UPI and batch processing.

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.060
Like any FD and Natch, this
helps you quickly eliminate wrong

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.039
options in speed related questions.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.290
Second, categorize by limit.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.980
Remember the key limits RTGS has a minimum
of two LAC rupees, while UPI and IMPS are

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.140
typically up to one lack or five lack,
and any FT has no RBI mandated limit.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.470
Third, always expand the
acronyms in your head.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.970
Any FT stands for National
Electronic Funds transfer, which

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.740
itself tells you it's Digital.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.305
Fourth, know the difference
between RBI and NPCI.

00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:04.955
RBI is the overall regulator.

00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:09.784
While NPCI is the operator for
retail payments like UPI, rupe and

00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:15.094
IMPS, and remember the 24 7 rule,
most modern electronic systems

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:19.844
like N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S-I-M-P-S and
UPI now work round the clock.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.415
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:26.595
All right, friends, let's
talk about the common traps.

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.735
A classic mistake is confusing
any FT timings and limits.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:36.195
Remember, both are 24 7 now, but
only RTGS has that two lack minimum

00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:40.275
don't fall for the belief that
UPI is only for small payments.

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:44.115
While it's great for your T stall
payments, its limit can go up to

00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:47.865
one LAC rupees and even higher
for IPOs or hospital bills.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.280
Another one is thinking
IMPS is only for mobile.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.740
Nope, you can use it via internet banking.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.830
Too many people also ignore the role
of NPCI, focusing only on RBI remember.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.190
NPCI is the powerhouse behind
most retail payment systems.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.920
Also don't overlook N. It's
the backbone for bulk recurring

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.960
payments like salaries and pensions.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.250
And finally, please don't assume
all payment systems are real time.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.260
Any FT is processed in batches, making
it fast, but not truly real time like

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.470
RTGS or U-P-I-W-H framework Summary.

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:26.705
So to summarize this entire
chapter, quickly, what is it?

00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:30.275
These are systems for transferring
money and final settlement.

00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:35.015
Why do we need them to ensure our
funds move securely and efficiently?

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:39.549
When are they used during any financial
transaction involving money transfer?

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.180
Where are they used across
all sectors of the economy?

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.760
My friend who is involved, individuals,
businesses, banks, and of course the RBI.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.230
And how does it all work?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.215
Through the various mechanisms we
discussed, like N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S and UPI.

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:57.505
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:57.864 --> 00:07:59.844
Example, one question.

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:04.015
Which of the following payment systems
in India is primarily designed for

00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:08.364
large value interbank transactions
and offers real-time gross settlement?

00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:15.625
A-N-E-F-T-B-U-P-I-C-R-T-G-S-D-I-M-P-S
understand the question

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.185
before moving to explanation.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.690
The keywords here are large value
and real-time gross settlement.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.260
NE ft is for retail payments
and works in batches.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.450
UPI is also for instant retail payments,
but not typically large value in the bank.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.480
IMPS is also for instant retail payments,
RTGS or real-time gross Settlement is

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.370
specifically designed for high value
transactions with a minimum of two AEs and

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.840
settles them individually and immediately
it perfectly fits the description.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.680
Correct answer C. Example two question.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.610
What is the minimum transaction
amount required for initiating

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.140
a real-time gross settlement?

00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:57.150
RTGS transaction in India?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:04.439
A. No minimum limit B. 10,000 Rupees C
one LA Rupees D two LA Rupees understand

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.600
the question before moving to explanation.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:09.375
This is a direct memory based question.

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:12.285
Remember, art Trick R for rupees, tolac.

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:16.365
The Reserve Bank of India has
clearly stated that RTGS is

00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:17.835
for high value transactions.

00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:22.875
Therefore, the minimum amount required
for an RTGS transaction is tolac rupees.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:26.805
There is no upper limit set
by RBI, by the way, correct

00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:29.955
answer D example three question.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:33.645
Which organization is responsible
for operating the unified

00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:35.895
payments interface, UPI in India?

00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:41.775
A Reserve Bank of India, RBIB, securities
and Exchange Board of India sebi

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:47.295
C, national Payments Corporation of
India, N-P-C-I-D, ministry of Finance.

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:50.235
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:52.935
The question asks who operates UPI?

00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:56.895
While RBI is the main regulator
of all payment systems, it

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:58.785
doesn't operate UPI directly.

00:09:59.025 --> 00:10:00.975
SEBI handles the securities market.

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:03.810
The Ministry of Finance
handles fiscal policy.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.520
The correct answer is the National
Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.199
It is the special umbrella organization
created for operating all retail

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:18.660
payments and settlement systems in India,
including UPI, rupe, IMPS, and natch.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.040
Correct answer, see.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.640
Thank you.

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:21.569
See you in the next lecture.
