00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.410
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial inclusion.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.560
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.370
This is it.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.190
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.650
So what is this big term?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.940
Financial inclusion.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.860
Think of it as sending a formal
invitation to everyone to join

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.630
the country's economic party.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.650
It refers to the process
of ensuring that everyone.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.850
Especially our vulnerable groups, like the
weaker sections and low income families,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.000
gets access to financial services and
not just any access mind you, but timely,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.940
adequate, and at an affordable cost.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.590
The goal is to bring the unbanked
and underbanked folks into

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.330
the formal financial system.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.129
We are talking about essential
services like savings accounts, credit

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.140
insurance, and sending money home.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.040
It's all about promoting inclusive
growth, enabling every single person to

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.980
participate in the economic mainstream,
and most importantly, improve their lives.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:07.425
Real world relevance.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:11.595
Now you might ask, sir, why
is this so important for me?

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:16.425
Well, my friend, understanding
this is absolutely crucial because

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:20.865
it directly impacts your ability
to serve a diverse customer base

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:24.795
and implement government schemes
effectively when you are in a bank.

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:29.515
This knowledge helps you identify
and address the financial needs

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:31.435
of people who have been left out.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:36.175
It's a win-win, contributing to
the bank's social objectives, and

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:37.914
of course its business growth.

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:43.365
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:45.884
Questions on this topic are not random.

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:50.565
Around 30% of them will be on
definition and core concepts.

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:54.554
Testing your basic understanding
of what financial inclusion is,

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:56.985
its objectives and its importance.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.790
The biggest chunk, about 40% will focus
on government schemes and initiatives

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.340
asking about specific programs like
P-M-J-D-Y-P-M-S-B-Y, and their features.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.080
About 15% of questions will explore
the challenges and solutions.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730
Looking at the hurdles in achieving
our goal, another 10% will test

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
your knowledge of the impact and
benefits on people and the economy.

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:26.905
And a tiny 5% will be about the
big players, the regulatory bodies

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:32.635
and policies like the role of RPI
and nabard, key concepts and tips.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.815
Now let's meet the
superstars of this show.

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:42.565
First, there's PM JDY or Phan Ri
Jhan Yna, the National Mission to

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:44.665
give everyone access to banking.

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.185
Then we have the insurance duo.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.200
P-M-S-B-Y or Phan Man, Akima Yo, which
is an accident insurance scheme and pm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.670
JJ BY, the Phan man Jo, which is a life
insurance scheme for old age planning,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.250
we have PY, the Utter pension Yona,
mainly for workers in the unorganized

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.650
sector to fuel small businesses.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.450
There's Mudra, the Microunits
Development and Refinance Agency Limited.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:20.425
Which helps banks lend to
microenterprises to reach the last mile.

00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:24.625
We have our heroes, the business
correspondents or bcs, who

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:28.045
are agents providing banking
services in remote areas.

00:03:28.435 --> 00:03:32.935
And the foundation of it all is
financial literacy, which is simply

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:37.829
educating people about all these
wonderful products, methods of solving.

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:40.975
To tackle questions, think strategically.

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:45.835
Use objective driven analysis,
meaning for any scheme, first,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:47.275
figure out its main goal.

00:03:47.635 --> 00:03:51.025
Is it about universal
access or social security?

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:55.770
Next, use beneficiary identification
to pinpoint who the scheme is for.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.050
Are we talking about unbanked
households or small entrepreneurs?

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:02.725
Then understand the mechanism.

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:07.915
Grasp how the scheme actually works, like
zero balance accounts or microcredit.

00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:10.524
Also, try some impact assessment.

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.185
Consider the broader effects
on poverty and economic growth.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:19.375
Finally, master challenge solution
pairing for every challenge, like lack

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:23.875
of awareness, know the corresponding
solution, shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:25.809
Want some smart techniques.

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.869
Of course, you do use acronym association.

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:34.450
For instance, P-M-J-D-Y becomes
Han Ana or People's Wealth Scheme.

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.940
Also practice keyword linking.

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:41.289
The moment you see no frills account,
your brain should immediately connect

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.539
it to basic savings, bank deposit.

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:48.830
Another great trick is categorization
group schemes by their purpose.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.659
For instance, insurance includes
P-M-S-B-Y and P-M-J-J-B-Y.

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:59.719
Pension means a PY credit means mudra,
and in multiple choice questions,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.820
always use the elimination strategy to
remove options that are obviously wrong.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.460
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:10.520
Alright, let's talk
about the common traps.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.880
Please avoid confusing schemes.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.870
Don't mix up the features of
P-M-S-B-Y and P-M-J-J-B-Y.

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.380
Also, never ignore the
affordable cost part.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.300
Financial inclusion is about reasonably
priced services, not just access.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.750
A big mistake is underestimating
technology's role.

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:32.110
Digital banking and adhar
are game changers here.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.330
Don't believe it's only for the poor.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.310
As the aim is to integrate everyone, and
please don't focus only on urban areas.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:44.870
Financial inclusion is hugely focused
on rural and semi-urban regions.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.250
WH framework summary.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.760
To summarize it all in a
simple framework, what is it?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.600
Ensuring access to affordable
financial services for all.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.800
Why do we do it?

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.830
To promote inclusive
growth and reduce poverty?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.880
When is it applied continuously
through ongoing policies?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.140
Where does it happen?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.040
Everywhere?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.980
With a special focus on
rural and remote areas.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.330
Who is it for low income individuals
and the unbanked population.

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:16.719
And how is it done through government
schemes, technology and financial

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.599
literacy fully worked out examples.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.429
Let's work through an example.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.739
Example, one question.

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.060
Which of the following government schemes
aims to provide universal access to

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.325
banking facilities with a focus on zero
balance accounts for every household?

00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:33.655
A pr,

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:37.375
pr

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:40.494
C,

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:43.614
pr

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.630
y understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:52.305
All right, let's analyze this.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:56.715
The keywords are universal access to
banking and zero balance accounts.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.215
Let's check the options.

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:01.905
A-P-M-S-B-Y is accident insurance, not it.

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.455
CAPY is a pension scheme.

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:04.965
Nope.

00:07:05.205 --> 00:07:07.965
D-P-M-J-J-B-Y is life insurance.

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:08.465
Wrong.

00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:11.675
Again, this leaves us with B-P-M-J-D-Y.

00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:15.395
Its entire mission was to give
every household a bank account.

00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:17.405
Famously, a zero balance one.

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:18.784
It's a perfect match.

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:20.344
So B is our answer.

00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:22.474
Example two question.

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:27.094
A key challenge in achieving complete
financial inclusion in India, especially

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:32.645
in rural areas, is often related to a high
literacy rates among the rural population.

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:36.245
B, abundance of physical bank
branches in remote villages.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.840
C, lack of adequate financial
literacy and awareness.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.560
D over reliance on digital
transactions by the elderly.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.120
Understand the question before moving
to explanation here we are looking

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.130
for a key challenge in rural areas.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.050
Let's dissect the options option A
high literacy rates are a challenge.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.945
That's absurd.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.510
High literacy would help.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.350
Option B says there's an abundance
of bank branches and villages.

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:04.625
If only that's the exact
opposite of the problem.

00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:08.285
Option D says, the elderly
are over reliant on digital.

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:11.435
Again, the challenge is
getting them to use digital,

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.025
not that they use it too much.

00:08:13.295 --> 00:08:16.745
Option C points to a lack of
financial literacy and awareness.

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:19.265
This is a classic well-known barrier.

00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:22.895
Even if you have a bank, if you
don't know how to use it or why

00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:24.245
you should, what's the point?

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:26.615
So C is the most logical challenge.

00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:28.664
Example three question.

00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:31.844
Which of the following statements
best describes the role of

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:35.025
business correspondence or
bcs in financial inclusion?

00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:39.164
A. They are responsible for formulating
national financial policies.

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:43.664
B, they act as intermediaries to
deliver banking services in areas

00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:45.194
without physical bank branches.

00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:49.995
C, they primarily manage the investment
portfolios of high net worth individuals.

00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:54.345
D, they are government officials
responsible for auditing bank operations.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.260
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.910
The question asks about the role
of business correspondence or bcs.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.410
Let's look at our choices.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.230
Option A says they make national policy.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.189
That's the job of the government
and RBI, not our bcs on the ground.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.339
Option C Cs, they manage
money for rich people.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.780
That's a wealth manager.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.339
Not a BC who serves the unbanked
option D claims they are auditors.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.280
No auditing is a completely
different function.

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:27.589
This leaves us with option B. It says they
act as intermediaries to deliver banking

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:29.390
services where there are no branches.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.819
This is precisely their job description.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.630
They are the human ATMs, the face
of the bank in remote villages.

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.160
This is the correct answer.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.939
Thank you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.260
See you in the next lecture.
