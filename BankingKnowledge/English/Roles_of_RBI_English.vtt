00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.610
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on roles of RBI ever felt

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.740
like your brain needed a power up.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.030
This is it.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.210
The Reserve Bank of India or RBI is
the big boss of all banks in India.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.320
It kicked off its operations on April
1st, 1935 under the RBI Act of 1934.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:27.335
Its main job, its derma, is to
manage our country's monetary

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:29.255
policy and financial system.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:34.685
Think of RBI as the banker's bank and
the government's bank, playing the

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:39.635
crucial role of a captain to steer the
economy towards stability and growth.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:44.315
It's the one managing our currency,
wrestling with inflation, keeping

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:45.905
an eye on commercial banks.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.985
And handling our foreign exchange.

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:53.355
So let's get into its key
roles, concept explanation.

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:57.165
First up, the RBI is a monetary authority.

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:02.355
This means it formulates, implements,
and monitors the monetary policy.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:03.819
What's the main goal?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.619
To keep prices stable?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.520
AKA.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.509
Keep inflation in check while
also supporting economic growth.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.699
It has a toolkit for this with fancy
names like repo rate, reverse repo

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:21.970
rate, cash reserve ratio, or CRR and
statutory liquidity ratio or SLR,

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.039
all to control the money supply.

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:29.085
Next, it's the regulator and
supervisor of the financial system.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.745
The RBI sets the playground
rules for all banks.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:37.575
Its aim is to maintain our trust in the
banking system, protect the money of

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:42.980
depositors like you and me, and ensure we
get good cost-effective banking services.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:47.105
This involves everything from
giving out licenses to new

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:51.365
banks, to conducting surprise
inspections and setting guidelines.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:57.305
It is also the manager of Foreign
Exchange RBI manages the Foreign Exchange

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.366
Management Act, or FEMA from 1999.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.839
This is to make foreign trade and payments
smooth and to ensure the foreign exchange

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:08.269
market in India grows in an orderly way.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
You'll often see it jump into the market
to make sure our rupees value doesn't

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.440
go on a crazy rollercoaster ride.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.660
Another very visible role is
as the issuer of currency, that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.490
crisp new note in your wallet.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.900
That's from the RBI.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:28.305
It issues and exchanges, currency
notes and coins, making sure

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:29.775
there's enough cash flowing.

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:35.415
It also has the job of taking back old
one-out currency that is no longer fit

00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:39.375
for circulation, which helps maintain
public confidence in our money.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.329
Then there's its developmental role.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.179
RBI isn't just a strict regulator.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.190
It also has a soft side.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.299
It performs many promotional
functions to support national goals.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.739
This includes pushing for financial
inclusion so that even people in

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.750
remote villages get banking services.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.930
Developing specialized financial
institutions and supporting

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.800
crucial sectors like agriculture
and small scale industries.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.370
The RBI is also the banker to government.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.870
It acts like a merchant banker for
both the central and state governments.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.590
It handles their accounts, receives
money, and makes payments for

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:19.480
them, and manages public debt.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.250
It's also the wise advisor the government
turns to for financial matters.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.420
And finally, it is the banker to banks.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.990
Just like you have an account
with a bank, all commercial

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.670
banks have accounts with the RBI.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.860
It gives them short-term loans through
the repo window, and most importantly,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.230
acts as a lender of last resort.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.980
It also helps banks settle
transactions with each other.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:46.255
Real world relevance.

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:52.045
Now, understanding these rules is super
important because RBI's actions directly

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:56.725
hit banking operations, interest rates,
and all the rules banks must follow.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:00.175
It helps you understand the
whole economic picture that

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:02.394
influences every banking decision.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.500
For instance, RBI's policies directly
impact day-to-day banking operations,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.700
like how much cash a bank must keep
in reserve, and how much it can lend.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.930
The interest rates on your loans
and deposits are heavily influenced

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.030
by changes in RBI's, key rates like
repo and reverse repo for banks.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:26.310
Understanding RBI's regulatory compliance
framework is non-negotiable to avoid

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.050
penalties and protect customers.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.300
And on a macro level, RBI's
decisions shape the entire economic

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.710
environment affecting inflation,
currency stability, and the financial

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.900
markets breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.390
Questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.220
About 40% are direct definition of
function-based questions, simply

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.650
asking you to identify a specific role.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.680
Around 25% are tool or mechanism
based questions focusing on

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.050
instruments like repo rate or CRR.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.790
Then 15% are clever scenario based
questions where they give you a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.700
situation and ask what the RBI would do.

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:13.165
A smaller chunk, about 10% are historical
questions about its establishment

00:05:13.165 --> 00:05:18.385
or key acts, and the final 10% are
objective based questions asking about

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:22.960
the primary goal behind a certain
RBI function formulas and tricks.

00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:28.965
Thankfully there are no scary mathematical
formulas here, but we do have some memory

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.425
tricks for the monetary policy tools.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:37.995
Just remember QRSL for the quantitative
and rate-based tools for RBI's main

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:43.125
objectives, think PGFI, price stability,
growth, and financial inclusion.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.430
Remember it was established
under the RBI Act of 1934 and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.190
started work on April 1st, 1935.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.150
Foreign exchange is all about FEMA 1999.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.350
And don't forget, its key function
for banks is being the lender of

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.080
last resort methods of solving.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.545
When you see a question,
use these methods.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.790
Try keyword association.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.210
If you see inflation control,
your brain should immediately

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.860
scream monetary authority.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.870
Use the elimination method.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.040
If an option sounds like a job for
sebi, which handles capital markets,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.960
you know, it's not RBI's role.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.500
For every role, try to
understand why it exists.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.670
For example, why issue currency
to maintain public confidence?

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.480
Also learn to distinguish
similar roles like banker to

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.460
government versus banker to banks.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.590
It's all about who the client is.

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:40.150
Finally for scenario questions, use
contextual analysis to figure out

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.429
which RBI function fits the story.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.719
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be even smarter.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:48.580
Use mnemonics for roles.

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.010
You could make one up like
M-R-M-I-D-B-B for all the key functions.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.104
Always focus on core mandates,
price, stability, financial

00:06:58.104 --> 00:06:59.784
stability, and development.

00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:04.255
Most questions will touch upon these
watch out for negative questions

00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:09.505
like, which is not a role of RBI,
and please prioritize monetary policy

00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:11.185
and its tools in your preparation.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:13.195
They are very frequently tested.

00:07:13.554 --> 00:07:17.240
The best shortcut is to practice with
more questions, to spot patterns,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.640
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.550
A very common mistake is confusing.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.320
RBI with commercial banks.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.300
RBI is the central bank.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.130
It doesn't deal with us directly.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.300
Another classic blunder is mixing
up monetary and fiscal policy.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.430
Monetary policy is RBI's.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.000
Job fiscal policy involving
taxes and government spending

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.380
belongs to the government.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.860
Also, don't assume RBI
regulates everything.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.760
SEBI handles capital markets
and IRDA handles insurance.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.050
Misunderstanding.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.780
The term lender of last
resort is also common.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.680
It's to help solvent banks with
temporary cash shortages, not to

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.390
blindly bail out failing ones.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.390
Lastly, don't ignore
the developmental role.

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:04.280
RBI does a lot more than just
regulate WH framework summary.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.890
So to sum it all up, what is the RBI?

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.050
It is the Central Bank of India.

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.850
Why does it exist to maintain price and
financial stability and promote growth?

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.260
When does it do this?

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.890
It was established in 1935
and works continuously.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.410
Where is it headquartered in Mumbai?

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.760
Who does it impact?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.640
Banks, the government, and
every single one of us.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.350
And how does it do its job?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.830
Through monetary tools,
regulations, and managing currency.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.840
Let's look at some fully
worked out examples.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.090
Example, one question.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.959
Which of the following is the primary
objective of the Reserve Bank of

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:41.789
India as a monetary authority?

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.370
A. Maximizing government revenue.

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:46.650
B, maintaining price stability.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.410
C. Promoting foreign trade exclusively.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.750
D providing loans directly to the
public understand the question

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.280
before moving to explanation.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.360
The question asks for the main
goal of RBI's, monetary authority

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.200
role, option A. Maximizing
revenue is the government's job.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.830
Option C is part of its
foreign role, but not primary.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.080
Option D is what commercial banks.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.440
So B is the correct answer.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.550
Maintaining price stability is the
core objective of its monetary policy.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.770
Example two question.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.700
The Reserve Bank of India acts
as the lender of last resort for

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.200
which of the following entities?

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.150
A individual citizens.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
B State governments, C, commercial banks.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.215
D, international Monetary Fund.

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:32.155
Understand the question before.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.325
Moving to explanation.

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:37.975
The term lender of last resort
means providing emergency liquidity.

00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:40.285
RBI doesn't lend to individuals.

00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:44.515
So A is out, it is a banker to state
governments, but this specific term

00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:46.315
applies to financial institutions.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.710
The IMF is an international body.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.450
This role is specifically for commercial
banks to prevent a system-wide crisis.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.830
So C is correct.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.420
Example three question, which
act primarily governs the Reserve

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.660
Bank of India's functions related
to foreign exchange management.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:09.440
A Banking Regulation Act 1949 B.
Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 C.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:15.650
Foreign Exchange Management Act, FEMA
1999 D. Negotiable Instruments Act 1891.

00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:18.415
Understand the question
before Moving to explanation.

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:21.685
The question is about the Law
For Foreign Exchange Management.

00:10:22.045 --> 00:10:26.905
The Banking Regulation Act is for banking
rules, the RBI Act, established RBI.

00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:29.905
The Negotiable Instruments
Act is for things like checks.

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:34.225
The Foreign Exchange Management
Act of FEMA 1999 was specifically

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:35.575
created for this purpose.

00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:38.155
RBI is the authority that implements it.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.135
Therefore, C is the correct answer.

00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:41.125
Thank you.

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:42.445
See you in the next lecture.
