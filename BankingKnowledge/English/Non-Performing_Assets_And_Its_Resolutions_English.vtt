00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.790
Welcome my friend to today's lecture on
non-performing assets and its resolution.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.860
This concept looks scary.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.880
Don't worry.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.885
We brought snacks and metaphors.

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:13.905
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.575
So what is this whole drama about?

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.995
Non-performing assets or NPAs array?

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.275
Just think of them as bad loans.

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:26.325
These are loans or advances where
the borrower has forgotten to

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:30.825
pay the principle or interest
for a period of 90 days or more.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:35.295
Essentially an asset becomes
non-performing when it stops

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:37.185
earning any income for the bank.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.535
Much like a lazy employee who
just shows up but does no work.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:46.605
When a borrower doesn't pay for a long
time, the loan is no longer a healthy,

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:48.855
happy asset on the bank's balance sheet.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.350
Now these NPAs have their own family tree
classified into three categories based

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.240
on how long they've been naughty and how
likely the bank is to get its money back.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.180
First, we have substandard assets.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.009
These are assets that have been NPAs
for a period of 12 months or less.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.220
Simple, right?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.140
If a loan has been an NPA for up to one
year, it's sitting in this category.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.050
Next, we have the doubtful assets.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.330
An asset gets this tag if it has been in
the substandard category for 12 months.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.160
This means the loan has been an NPA
for more than a year, and the bank

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.210
is now seriously doubting if it
will ever see the full amount again.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.060
Finally, we have the loss assets.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.979
A loss asset is one where everyone
from the bank's own auditors to the RBI

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.619
inspection team has confirmed the loss.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.030
The money is gone.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.350
It's considered uncollectible, but
for some reason, the bank hasn't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.570
formally wiped it off its books yet.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.210
Resolution mechanisms for NPAs to
tackle this growing problem of NPAs.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.560
The government and regulatory bodies
have created some special tools.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.030
First up is the securitization
and reconstruction of financial

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.370
Assets and Enforcement of Security
Act, or SAR Fusi Act of 2002.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.050
This powerful act allows banks to
auction properties of defaulters

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.920
to recover loans without getting
stuck in long court battles.

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:24.025
But remember, this only works
for secured loans where an

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:25.704
asset is given as collateral.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:30.325
Then we have the debt
recovery tribunals or DRTs.

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:35.875
These were set up under an act from
1993 to provide a legal court like

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.685
system for banks to recover their
money and speed up the process.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.850
We also have asset reconstruction
companies or arcs, think of these as

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.920
specialized doctors for bad loans.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.380
They buy the NPS from banks at a discount
and then use their expertise to either

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.855
recover the money from the borrower.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:56.515
Or sell the asset.

00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:03.144
The big one is the insolvency and
bankruptcy code, or IBC from 2016.

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:08.725
This is a complete rule book for handling
insolvency for companies and individuals.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:14.305
Its main goal is to solve the issue in a
fixed time to get the most value from the

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:17.065
assets and be fair to everyone involved.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:21.745
Sometimes a simple one-time
settlement or OTS is used.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.690
Here the bank and borrower agree
on a final settlement amount,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.820
usually less than the total due.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.609
Just to close the chapter, this is common
for smaller loans and there was the Joint

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.130
Lenders Forum or JLF, which was a platform
for multiple banks to come together and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.230
decide on a plan for a stressed asset.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.490
Though its concept is more important
now as other mechanisms have taken over.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.570
Real world relevance.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.770
Understanding NPAs is super
crucial because it directly hits

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.750
the bank's health and its profits.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.590
For a banking professional,
this means managing credit risk.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.640
By spotting potential NPAs
early, it involves creating

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.615
and monitoring strategies for
recovering these stressed assets.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.870
There is also the matter of
regulatory compliance, which means

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.900
following all RBI guidelines on NPAs.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.250
This work contributes to the
financial stability and overall

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.420
performance of the bank.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.530
It even involves customer relationship
management where you have to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.250
engage with defaulting customers
to find workable solutions.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.180
Ultimately, it's about understanding
the profitability impact,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.110
recognizing how these NPAs can
hurt the bank's balance sheet.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.600
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.270
Questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.450
About 30% are definition based questions.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.720
Simply testing, if you know what an NPA
is, another 25% are classification based,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.065
focusing on the differences between
substandard doubtful and loss assets.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.840
Roughly 25% of questions are
on the resolution mechanisms.

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:05.460
Testing your knowledge of acts
like sar, Farsi, DRT and IBC.

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.530
Around 10% are scenario-based questions
where they give you a situation and

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.770
ask you to classify the NPA and the
final 10% are regulatory or questions

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.530
about RBI rules or government policies.

00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:21.915
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:25.425
The main formula to
remember is the NPA trigger.

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.865
An asset turns into an NPA if
the principle or interest is

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:31.965
overdue for 90 days or more.

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:36.795
For the classification timeline,
just remember this simple flow First,

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.045
it's substandard for up to 12 months.

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:43.040
If it remains an NPA, it becomes
doubtful for more than 12 months.

00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:47.785
Finally, if it's declared
uncollectible, it becomes a loss asset.

00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:52.435
The trick is to always remember the
90 day rule as the starting point.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.295
For all NPA calculations.

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:56.185
Think of it as a journey.

00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:00.805
90 days starts the trip leading
to substandard, doubtful, and

00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.995
finally, the destination of loss.

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:10.175
Methods of solving for categorization
analysis, you must carefully read how

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:14.855
long the loan has been overdue and
match it to the criteria for substandard

00:06:15.035 --> 00:06:17.915
doubtful or loss for resolution.

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:21.125
Mechanism matching, understand
the job of each tool.

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:24.185
Is it a secured asset thinks are facing?

00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:26.315
Is it a corporate insolvency?

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:29.975
Think IBC for impact assessment questions.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:34.025
Think about how NPAs reduce
a bank's profits because of

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:36.185
provisioning and erode its capital.

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.645
And for regulatory compliance checks.

00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:41.790
Just recall the broad
principles set by the RBI.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.690
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.260
Let's learn some keywords
for the acts for sar.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.440
Fei.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.330
Think secured assets.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.790
Auction, no quote for DRT,
remember, debt Recovery tribunals.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.930
Legal process.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.500
For a RC, it's buy bad
loans, specialized companies.

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:06.864
For IBC, it's insolvency,
bankruptcy, and time bound.

00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:09.625
Also use the timeline mnemonic.

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:15.655
90 days start then S for substandard,
D for doubtful, and L for nos.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:20.455
When you are stuck in a multiple choice
question, use the elimination strategy

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:26.544
to remove obviously wrong answers and
always try to focus on why a rule exists.

00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:31.825
For instance, SAR FEI was introduced to
give banks more power for faster recovery.

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:35.685
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:38.775
Please, my friend, avoid
these common traps.

00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:41.625
Don't confuse 90 days with three months.

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:43.575
The RBI rule is specific.

00:07:43.695 --> 00:07:44.565
90 days.

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:49.845
A common error is mixing up the criteria
for substandard and doubtful assets.

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:52.294
Just remember the 12 month timeline.

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:56.765
Also, don't believe that all
NPAs are immediately written off.

00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:58.895
A write off is the final step.

00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:03.575
After all recovery efforts have failed,
and make sure you understand the

00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:05.705
different roles of the resolution bodies.

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:10.775
Lastly, don't forget that banks must
set aside money called provisioning for

00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:13.534
NPAs, which directly hurts their profits.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.604
WH framework summary.

00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:19.995
So to quickly summarize, what is an NPA?

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.655
It's a loan that stops generating
income because payment is

00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:25.604
overdue for 90 days or more.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:27.375
Why is it important?

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:30.974
It's essential for checking a
bank's health and managing risk.

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:32.294
When does it happen?

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:35.145
When a payment is
overdue for over 90 days.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.690
Where does this happen?

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.660
Primarily in the banking
and financial sector?

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.950
Who is involved?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.320
Banks, borrowers, and regulatory
bodies like RBI And how is it handled?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.550
It's identified, classified, and
then resolved through mechanisms

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.460
like sar, phase CDRT, and IBC.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.520
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.730
Let's tackle our first example question.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.630
A loan account where the principle
or interest payment has remained

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.830
overdue for a period of 90 days
or more is classified as a.

00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:11.490
A. Standard asset B,
special mention account.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.240
SMAC, non-performing asset, NPAD.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.045
Performing asset understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:22.319
The solution is straightforward.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.810
Step one, understand the definition.

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.319
The question is literally asking
for the definition of a loan

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:30.119
overdue for 90 days or more.

00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:32.369
Step two, look at the options.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.459
A standard asset is a
healthy loan, so that's out.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.400
An SMA is an early warning, not the
final classification at 90 days.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.930
A performing asset is just another
name for a standard asset that leaves

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.740
option C, non-performing asset,
which is the perfect definition.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.870
So the correct answer is C.

00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:54.525
Here is example two question.

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:58.815
A loan account that has remained as
a non-performing asset for a period

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:03.105
of 15 months would be classified
as A, a, substandard asset.

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:04.695
B. Doubtful asset.

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.135
C. Loss asset.

00:10:06.285 --> 00:10:07.605
D, standard asset.

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:10.170
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:12.765
For the solution.

00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:15.194
Let's recall the classification timeline.

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:17.145
An asset is substandard.

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:19.395
If it's an NPA for up to 12 months.

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:24.314
It becomes doubtful if it stays in the
substandard category for over 12 months.

00:10:24.584 --> 00:10:27.645
Here, the loan has been
an NPA for 15 months.

00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:32.564
Since 15 months is more than 12 months,
it has crossed the substandard stage and

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:34.694
has entered the doubtful asset category.

00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:41.370
So the correct answer is B. And our
final example question, which of the

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.990
following acts empowers banks and
financial institutions to take possession

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.520
of and sell secured assets of defaulting
borrowers without quote, intervention

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.770
for recovery of dues, a recovery of debts
due to banks and financial institutions.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.240
Act 1993.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:03.225
B Insolvency and bankruptcy
code 2016 C. Securitization and

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:07.305
reconstruction of Financial Assets
and Enforcement of security interest.

00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.915
SAR FEI Act 2000 2D.

00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:12.645
Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.

00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:15.225
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:16.665 --> 00:11:17.685
Let's solve this.

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:22.545
