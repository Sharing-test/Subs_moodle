00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.260
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on banking technologies.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.720
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.230
So what are these fancy
banking technologies?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.330
Simply put, they are the application
of information technology and computer

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.730
systems to make banking operations.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.770
Services and our overall
experience, less of a headache.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.780
This tech magic covers everything
from the massive core systems that

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.910
juggle all our accounts to the digital
channels we use every day, like internet

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.130
banking, mobile banking, those trusty
ATMs and various payment systems.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.930
The bid idea here.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:48.025
Is to boost efficiency slash costs beef
up security, and give us customers more

00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:50.485
convenient and accessible services.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:55.375
And trust me, these technologies
are always evolving, constantly

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.935
modernizing the entire financial
sector, real world relevance.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.949
In the real world, this is what
you'll actually be dealing with

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.520
First Core banking solutions or CBS.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.890
You'll be using this for all your daily
tasks, managing accounts and processing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.780
transactions, making sure customer
service is smooth as butter chicken gravy.

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.720
Then you have the digital payment
systems like U-P-I-N-E-F-T, and RTGS.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.020
Understanding these is absolutely critical
for helping customers transfer money and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.330
advising them on the best way to do it.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.520
Next, internet and mobile banking,
you will be the guide for customers

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.350
navigating these platforms, fixing their
small issues, and basically becoming a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.660
champion for digital banking convenience.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.940
Don't forget ATMs and kiosks,
knowing how they work and basic

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.720
troubleshooting helps you assist
customers who prefer self-service.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.600
And of course, cybersecurity measures.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.850
Being aware of security rules is
vital to shield customer data and the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.830
bank's money from digital villains.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.360
Lastly, data analytics, even if
you are not the one crunching the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
numbers, knowing how data is used
helps in figuring out what customers

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.990
need and making the service better.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.270
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.560
Now for your exam, questions
on this topic follow a certain

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540
pattern, so let's crack the code.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:27.785
About 30% are definition
or concept-based questions.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:32.255
These are straightforward asking
for a definition, a purpose, or

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.805
what an acronym like CBS stands for.

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:39.455
Then 25% are application
or functionality based.

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:44.915
These questions check how a technology
is used, like asking which one enables

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.925
real time gross settlement of funds.

00:02:47.394 --> 00:02:52.734
Another 20% are feature-based testing your
knowledge on specific characteristics.

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:58.345
For instance, asking for a key feature
of mobile banking, around 15% are

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:02.665
comparative questions where you have
to compare technologies like spotting

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:07.674
the main difference between any FD
and RTGS based on speed or cost.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:12.645
And the final 10% are about recent
developments or trends focusing

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:17.265
on new tech rules or innovations
such as which new technology is

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:21.495
becoming popular for cross-border
payments, formulas and tricks.

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:26.265
While there are no math formulas to
mug up, memorizing key concepts and

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:28.245
acronyms is your superpower here.

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:29.715
Let's make a list.

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:34.005
CBS is core banking solution, the
centralized brain of the bank.

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:37.165
ATM is the automated tele machine.

00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:41.785
Our friendly neighborhood cash
machine, POS is point of sale, the

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:46.645
little terminal for cart payments,
NEFT is National Electronic Funds

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:48.715
transfer, which works in batches.

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:53.875
RTGS is realtime gross settlement
for big realtime transfers.

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:56.905
IMPS is immediate payment service.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.300
The 24 7 instant transfer hero.

00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.715
UPI is the Unified payments interface.

00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:05.535
That instant payment system from NPCI.

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:11.145
Speaking of which NPCI is the National
Payments Corporation of India, the

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:13.215
big boss of retail payments in India.

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:17.774
BEAM stands for bar Interface
for money, A popular UPI app.

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:20.595
QR code is that quick response code.

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:25.335
We scan for everything and then
there's AI for artificial intelligence.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.280
And blockchain, the secure
record Keeping Tech.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.920
Finally, FinTech, which is just
financial technology methods of solving.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.910
To tackle these questions, you
need to understand the purpose and

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.960
features of each technology for
definition or acronym questions.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.190
The method is simple.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.760
Recall.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.380
If you are stuck, try to break down the
acronym and link the words to a banking

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.780
function for application questions.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.210
Think about the problem
the technology solves.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.610
How would a customer or banker use it?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.890
It's all about functional analysis.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.045
For feature-based questions, mentally
list the unique traits that set a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.159
technology apart from its cousins.

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:08.375
For imperative questions, quickly
sketch a mental comparison table,

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:12.815
compare them on speed, settlement
type limits, and availability.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:16.565
And for questions on recent
developments, just keep your eyes

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:18.365
and ears open to current affairs.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:21.335
In the financial world, it's
about general awareness.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.690
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.570
Here are some smart techniques for
acronyms like N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S and IMPS

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.880
just associate one key word national
electronic means batch, realtime.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.770
Gross means instant and large,
and immediate payment means 24 7.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.780
Instant, always use function first
thinking, identify the function needed,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.505
like instant transfer or centralized data,
and then find the technology that does it.

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:52.719
The elimination strategy
is your best friend.

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:56.320
If you're unsure, kick out the
options that are obviously wrong.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.390
Also, pay attention to keywords in
the question like real time batch or

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.549
centralized as they are big clues.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.349
And for systems like any FT and
RTGS try to visualize the money's

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.210
journey to understand how they differ
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.940
Now let's talk about common traps.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.990
A classic mistake is
confusing any FT and RTGS.

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.840
Remember, NEFT settles in batches, good
for smaller amounts, while RTGS is for

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.120
large instant one by one settlements.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.955
Another mixup is IMPS versus UPI
Both are instant, but IMPS is

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.650
a direct bank to bank transfer.

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:40.515
While UPI is built on IMPS and uses
handy virtual payment addresses.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.150
Many people think ATMs are just for cash,
but they forget about balance inquiries,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.280
many statements and bill payments never
underestimate cybersecurity basics.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.570
Things like strong passwords and not
sharing OTPs are super important.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:59.590
It's also a misconception
that all banking is digitized.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.489
Traditional branches are still
very important and a big one

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.405
is overlooking NP C'S role.

00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:09.344
Remember, it's the mothership for
many payment systems in India.

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:11.565
W Edge framework summary.

00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:14.625
So to wrap it all up,
what are we talking about?

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:18.315
The application of IT and
computer systems to banking.

00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:20.760
Why do we do it to improve efficiency?

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:25.025
Cut costs, boost security and
provide convenient services.

00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:26.315
When is it used?

00:07:26.434 --> 00:07:27.155
All the time.

00:07:27.335 --> 00:07:28.625
Constantly evolving.

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:29.885
Where is it applied?

00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:32.255
Across every single banking function.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:33.395
Who is involved?

00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:36.604
Banks, customers, regulators,
and tech companies.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:37.924
And how is it done?

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:41.344
Through software, digital
platforms, machines and secure

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:43.924
networks fully worked out Examples.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.210
Example, one question.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.320
Which of the following technologies
provides a centralized system that

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.000
integrates all core banking functions,
like deposits, loans, and customer

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.800
accounts across different branches?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.780
A automated tele machine, A
TMB point of sale, terminal.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.130
POSC.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.570
Core banking solution.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.115
CBS.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.470
D, immediate Payment Service.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.520
IMPS understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.380
The question asks for a single
centralized system for all core functions,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.810
and ATM is a self-service machine.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.270
A POS terminal is for card payments.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.340
IMPS is for fund transfers.

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:28.849
Only a core banking solution or CBS is
designed to centralize and integrate

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.680
every single banking operation.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:36.439
So the correct answer is C. Example
two question, which digital payment

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:41.179
system allows for instant 24 7
interbank electronic fund transfers

00:08:41.184 --> 00:08:43.309
using a virtual payment address?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.970
VPAA, national Electronic funds transfer,
N-E-F-T-B, real-time gross settlement.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:50.780
RTGS.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:57.530
C, unified Payments Interface, UPID,
electronic Clearing Service ECS understand

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.720
the question before moving to explanation.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.600
The keywords here are instant 24 7,
and especially virtual payment address.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.380
V-P-A-N-E-F-D is not
instant, it's batch based.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.840
RTGS is real time but not known.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.840
For VPA use ECS is for bulk payments.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.400
UPI is the only one that is instant 24 7,
and famously uses VPs for transactions.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.840
It's a perfect match.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.510
The correct answer is C. Example.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.830
Three question.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.730
What is the primary purpose of
implementing strong cybersecurity

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.560
measures in banking technology?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.410
A, to increase the speed of transactions.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.400
B, to reduce the cost
of banking operations.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.950
C, to protect customer data and financial
assets from unauthorized access and fraud.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.360
D, to enable new digital payment
methods, understand the question

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.010
before moving to explanation.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.560
The question wants the primary purpose.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.760
While security is related to
enabling digital methods, its most

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.650
fundamental job is protection.

00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:02.055
It's not mainly about speed
or direct cost reduction.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:06.525
The core number one reason for
cybersecurity is to protect customer

00:10:06.525 --> 00:10:08.925
data and the bank's money from hackers.

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.655
Therefore, the answer is clearly see.

00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:12.675
Thank you.

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:13.975
See you in the next lecture.
