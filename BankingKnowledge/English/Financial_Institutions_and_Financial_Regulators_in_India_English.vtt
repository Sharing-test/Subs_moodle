00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.710
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial institutions

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.350
and financial regulators in India.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.300
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
Think of a country's financial system
as its economic backbone, right?

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.780
This system stands on two massive
pillars, financial institutions,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.600
or fis and financial regulators.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.270
First, let's talk about the fis.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.180
These are the middlemen
of the money market.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.620
Imagine them as the great collectors
and distributors of wealth.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.450
They take funds from people like us
who are saving money, and they channel

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.160
it to those who need to borrow it.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000
Be it for a new business, a new
house, or for the government's grand

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.560
projects, they are the heroes who
provide services like accepting

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.110
deposits, lending money, managing our
investments, and even offering insurance.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.360
Your everyday commercial banks.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.645
Cooperative banks, the famous
non-banking financial companies,

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:12.105
or mbfc insurance giants and mutual
funds are all part of this family.

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:17.835
They are absolutely vital for economic
growth because they get idle money moving

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:20.325
and put capital to work efficiently.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.015
Now who keeps these money moving?

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.155
Heroes in check.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.935
Enter the second pillar,
the financial regulators.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.265
These are the super cops
of the financial world.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:35.375
They are government bodies
set up to oversee and control

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.755
what the fis are doing.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.120
Their main job is to maintain
the stability and integrity

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.780
of the whole system so it
doesn't just collapse one day.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.410
They protect the interests
of consumers like you and me.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.940
Prevent financial crimes and make
sure everything is fair and square.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.005
How do they do this?

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:58.755
By setting the rules of the game,
giving out licenses, conducting

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:03.075
surprise inspections, and
enforcing compliance in India.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:08.775
Our fantastic four regulators are
the Reserve Bank of India, RBI, the

00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:14.175
Securities and Exchange Board of India
sebi, the Insurance, regulatory and

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.906
Development Authority of India, IRDA.

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:21.864
And the Pension Fund, regulatory
and Development authority P-F-R-D-A,

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:23.845
the relationship is simple.

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:29.875
Fis make the economy run, and regulators
make sure they run safely and ethically,

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.005
building our trust in the system.

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.065
Real world relevance.

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:37.635
Now you might ask, why
should I care about all this?

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:41.385
Well, understanding this
is absolutely vital.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.495
It helps in ensuring compliance
with banking regulations, and

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:47.295
managing risks like a pro.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:53.175
For A CBO, this knowledge is the map to
navigate the complex world of banking.

00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:54.015
Ensure.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.290
Every rule is followed and understand
the bigger picture that affects both

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.600
customers and the bank's operations.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.240
Let's look at why it's so relevant.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.470
First, for banking, operations
and compliance, you need to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.370
follow RBI guidelines for
every single daily activity.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.980
For risk management, you must identify
and handle financial risks according

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.260
to the frameworks these regulators set.

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.850
When it comes to customer service and
product knowledge, you have to explain

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.100
banking products within the lines drawn
by the regulators for economic stability.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.990
Understanding regulatory policies helps
you see how the bank's own profits

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.850
and stability might be affected.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.400
Then there's financial inclusion where you
implement government and RBI schemes to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.740
bring banking to every corner of India.

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:48.635
And finally, market integrity, where
you play your part in maintaining

00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:50.825
fair practices and stopping fraud.

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:56.405
See, it's all connected breakdown
of question types based on

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.875
patterns from your exam.

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:01.085
Questions on this topic are
quite predictable, my friend.

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:01.685
Let's break it down.

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:07.335
About 40% of the questions will be
direct definition of fact-based.

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:11.595
They will ask you for a simple
definition of full form or a fact.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:16.695
For example, a classic question
is what is the full form of NBFC?

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:22.125
Around 30% of questions will be role
of function based, focusing on the main

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.375
duties or powers of an institution.

00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:27.915
For instance, which of the
following is a primary function

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:29.150
of the Reserve Bank of India?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.820
Then about 15% will be categorization
or classification questions

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.650
where you need to classify an
entity or identify its regulator.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.850
An example is which type of
financial institution accepts

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.170
deposits from the public?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.730
A smaller chunk, about 10% will be
matched the following questions.

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:54.784
They'll give you a list of institutions
and regulators and you have to playmaker.

00:04:55.174 --> 00:04:59.645
Finally, a tiny 5% might be
application or scenario based.

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:04.115
These are less common, but might
give you a small situation, like if

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:08.375
a company wishes to issue new shares
to the public, which regulatory body

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.380
must it approach formulas and tricks.

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:16.955
The good news is this topic is more
about concepts than complex math, so

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:19.174
there are no real formulas to memorize.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:19.725
Few.

00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:22.515
However, I do have some tricks for you.

00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:26.625
The most important trick is
Regulator Sector Association.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:28.575
Just lock this in your brain.

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:33.285
RBI is for the banking sector,
monetary policy and currency.

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:36.075
Sebi is the king of capital markets.

00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:38.865
Think stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:42.615
IRDA handles everything
in the insurance sector.

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:46.055
And P-F-R-D-A looks
after the pension sector.

00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:46.835
Simple.

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:50.885
Also, try to associate the
main act with the regulator.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:56.705
For instance, RBI operates under
the RBI ACT of 1934 and SEBI

00:05:56.825 --> 00:05:59.105
under the SEBI Act of 1992.

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:03.065
Understand the difference between
primary and secondary functions.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.280
For RBI monetary policy is
the main course for sebi.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.840
It's all about protecting investors
and always remember the hierarchy.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.810
RBI is the big boss, the central bank.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.410
You can even create simple mnemonics
like RSIP for our four main regulators,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.100
RBI, sebi, IRDA and P-F-R-D-A.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.750
Methods of solving.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.979
To tackle questions on this topic,
your approach should be based on a

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.200
solid understanding and quick recall.

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.270
First, understand the core purpose
for every institution or regulator.

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.270
Just ask yourself, what is its main job?

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.219
Which area does it control?

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:46.010
Second, identify key functions.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.700
Make a mental list of the most
important jobs for each body.

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.990
For RBI, it's issuing currency,
being the government's banker

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.729
and regulating other banks.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:58.690
Third categorize financial institutions.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.840
You must be able to tell the
difference between a commercial

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.539
bank and a cooperative bank or a
bank and an NBFC fourth map the

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.549
regulator to the regulated entity.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.109
When you see a financial entity in a
question, your brain should immediately

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:18.760
connect it to its regulator, mutual
fund, sebi life insurance policy.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.505
IRDI.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.460
Finally focus on what and who.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.880
A lot of questions are as simple as
what is X or who regulates y. Direct

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.159
factual recall is your best friend here.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.390
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.440
Of course, you do.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.510
First create flashcards.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.560
Make one for each institution
and regulator on it.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.550
Write its full form, main function,
and the sector, it governs

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.740
simple but super effective.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.140
Next try.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.970
Mind maps or diagrams, draw a basic
chart of the Indian financial system,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.110
show the money flowing and the
regulators watching over everything.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.380
A visual aid can cement
the concepts in your mind.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.320
Also, use keyword association.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.510
Train your brain to link keywords
instantly when you hear monetary policy.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.830
Think RBI.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.830
Stock Market, sebi Life Insurance.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.590
I-R-D-A-I, national Pension
System, or N-P-S-P-F-R-D-A.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.360
The elimination strategy is your best
weapon in multiple choice questions.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.930
If you're not sure of the
answer, start by throwing out the

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.700
options that are obviously wrong.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.530
If a question is about insurance,
why are RBI and sebi even in the

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.020
options, eliminate them immediately.

00:08:38.455 --> 00:08:40.795
Lastly, focus on the differences.

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:45.625
Pay close attention to what makes
similar entities different, like the key

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:50.035
distinctions between commercial banks
and regional rural banks, or the crucial

00:08:50.035 --> 00:08:55.405
differences between banks and n BFCs,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:59.335
All right, let's talk about
the common traps first.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:03.385
People often confuse the role of
RBI with the Ministry of Finance.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.010
Remember, RBI is the monetary
authority handling Money Supply.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.200
While the Ministry of Finance handles
fiscal policy and government money, don't

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.900
mix up sebi and IDIs jobs, SEBI regulates
investments like stocks and bonds.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.150
While IRDI regulates insurance, they
have their own separate kingdoms.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:31.090
A big misconception is that RBI regulates
everything financial, no, RBI primarily

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:37.330
regulates banks and some mbfc insurance
and capital markets have their own bosses.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.980
People also fail to distinguish between
commercial and cooperative banks.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.810
They are both banks, yes, but
cooperative banks have a different

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.640
structure and are regulated by both
RBI and state governments or nabad,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.610
and please understand mbfc properly,
they are financial institutions, but

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.319
they don't have a banking license.

00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:02.265
This means they cannot accept
demand deposits your current

00:10:02.295 --> 00:10:05.535
and savings accounts, and are
not part of the payment system.

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:10.905
Finally, don't assume all public sector
undertakings are regulated by one body.

00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:16.995
A public sector bank is regulated by RBI,
but a public sector insurance company is

00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:21.105
regulated by IRD AI WH framework summary.

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:23.290
So to wrap it all up quickly.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.610
What are we discussing?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.610
Financial institutions that move money
and financial regulators that watch them?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.300
Why do we need them to ensure stability?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.470
Protect us consumers, promote
fairness and help the economy grow.

00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:41.694
When is this relevant?

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:45.834
Always in daily financial
operations and policymaking.

00:10:46.224 --> 00:10:47.694
Where does this apply?

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:52.104
Across the entire Indian
financial system, banking, capital

00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:54.415
markets, insurance, and pensions.

00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:56.125
Who are the players?

00:10:56.425 --> 00:11:00.415
Institutions are the banks, n
BFCs and insurance companies.

00:11:00.775 --> 00:11:07.550
Regulators are our fantastic four
RBI, sebi, I-R-D-A-I and P-F-R-D-A.

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:12.595
And how do they regulate through
licensing, supervision, setting

00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:14.305
rules, and enforcing them.

00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:17.189
Fully worked out examples.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.140
Let's solve a few questions.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.329
Example, one question.

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:24.930
Which of the following is the
primary regulatory body for

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.339
commercial banks in India?

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.150
A. Securities and exchange
board of India sebi.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.199
B. Insurance, regulatory and
Development Authority of India.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.300
I-R-D-A-I-C.

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:42.000
Reserve Bank of India, RBID, pension Fund
Regulatory and Development Authority.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.200
P-F-R-D-A.

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:48.814
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, the question asks for

00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:51.035
the main regulator of commercial banks.

00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:54.694
Step one is to recall the
function of each regulator.

00:11:55.025 --> 00:12:01.475
SEBI is for capital markets I-R-D-A-I
for insurance and P-F-R-D-A for pensions.

00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:06.035
Commercial banks are the heart of the
banking system and who is the boss of the

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:08.555
banking system, the Reserve Bank of India.

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:09.185
Of course.

00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:12.155
Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:12.935
Simple.

00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:15.405
Example two question.

00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:19.694
Which financial institution in India
is not allowed to accept demand

00:12:19.694 --> 00:12:22.005
deposits current and savings accounts?

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:23.714
A commercial bank?

00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:30.525
B, regional rural bank C. Non-banking
financial company N-B-F-C-D, small

00:12:30.525 --> 00:12:34.545
finance bank understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:37.365
First, what are demand deposits?

00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:41.745
These are funds in current and savings
accounts that you can withdraw anytime.

00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:46.845
The question asks, which institution
cannot accept these commercial banks?

00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:51.045
Regional rural banks and small
finance banks are all proper banks.

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:55.995
Their main business is accepting such
deposits, but non-banking financial

00:12:55.995 --> 00:12:58.515
companies or n BFCs are different.

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:02.835
They offer bank-like services, but
don't have a full banking license.

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:06.755
A key rule for them is that they
cannot accept demand deposits.

00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:08.375
That's the main difference.

00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:13.175
So the correct option is
C. Example three question.

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:17.675
The securities and exchange Board
of India sebi primarily regulates

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:19.955
which of the following sectors A.

00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:26.944
Insurance sector B, banking sector C.
Capital market D. Pension funds understand

00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:28.925
the question before moving to explanation.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.030
This is a direct question
about a regulator's domain.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.740
The regulator is sebi.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.210
What is SE B'S job?

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.740
It was created to protect investors
and regulate the securities market.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.450
The securities market is just another
name for the capital market, the world

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.730
of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.845
Let's check the options.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.150
The insurance sector is regulated
by I-R-D-A-I, the banking sector

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.600
by RBI, pension funds by P-F-R-D-A.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.100
That leaves us with the capital market,
which is exactly sebi territory.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.550
So the correct answer is C. Thank you.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.260
See you in the next lecture.
