Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial abbreviations.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.200
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.840
Concept explanation.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.510
So what is this big fuss about?

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.100
Financial abbreviations?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.090
Think of them as the secret
language of the finance world.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310
They are simply shortened forms of
long, sometimes complicated words or

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.040
phrases used in banking and finance.

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.765
Why do they do this array
To make life easier?

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:34.385
Their mean job is to simplify
communication, save precious

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:36.635
time, and bring crystal clarity.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:41.495
When bankers are discussing complex
financial ideas, institutions or

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:45.485
products, for anyone involved in
finance or any friend like you

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:50.675
studying it, understanding these
little codes is absolutely essential.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:55.964
They pop up everywhere in official
bank documents, in newspaper articles,

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:58.275
and an everyday chatter at the bank.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.864
They are the ultimate shorthand
for a super fast-paced industry.

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:04.575
Real world relevance.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.145
Now, let's talk about where
you see this in the real world.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:13.315
Because this is not just theory
for efficient communication using

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:18.714
abbreviations like KYC or EMI, let's
bank staff quickly discuss complex

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:23.304
things with customers and colleagues
making daily work much smoother when

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:25.225
it comes to understanding documents.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.585
All those loan agreements
and investment statements are

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:29.770
filled with these short forms.

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:33.520
Knowing them means you can
actually understand what you're

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.890
signing in customer service.

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:40.570
When a customer asks about ATM
services or an NEFT transfer, a

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.009
banking professionals quick grasp of
these terms leads to fast and helpful

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.589
service for regulatory compliance.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.250
Government bodies use specific
abbreviations for their rules

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.330
and bank officers must know them
to keep the bank out of trouble.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:00.275
For market analysis, all financial
news is a sea of abbreviations

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:04.745
for economic indicators like
GDP or central banks like RBI.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:10.235
And finally, for internal operations,
everything inside the bank's own systems

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:15.635
uses abbreviations for processes like
RTGS offer different departments to keep

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.885
the internal machine running smoothly.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.315
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:22.005
For your exam.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:26.144
The questions on this topic are
thankfully not designed to trick you.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.685
They mostly fall into
two simple categories.

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:34.785
The first and most common type with
about an 80% chance of appearing

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:36.885
is full form identification.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:41.295
Here they give you an abbreviation
and you just have to pick the

00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:43.214
correct full form from the options.

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:47.565
For example, they might ask,
what does NPA stand for?

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.975
The second type, which is less
common but still shows up, is the

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:54.525
reverse abbreviation from full form.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:58.905
They give you the long name and you
have to find the correct short form.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:02.925
For example, they could ask,
what is the abbreviation for

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.755
real time gross settlement?

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:06.045
Simple enough, right?

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.145
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.150
Now you must be thinking, sir,
please give us the formula.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.600
But my friend, the best part is there
are no mathematical formulas here.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.780
The main trick to mastering these is just
good old fashioned memorization, but done

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.540
smartly, combined with regular revision.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.990
The first method is
systematic memorization.

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:32.185
Don't just learn them randomly.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:37.285
Organize them into logical groups, which
really helps your brain hold onto them.

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:39.565
Next is regular revision.

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:43.525
You must schedule time to
review them, otherwise they

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:45.295
will disappear from your memory.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:47.965
Then try contextual learning.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:53.065
Learn them by seeing how they are used
in real financial news or documents.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.340
This improves practical recall.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.610
And finally, use association techniques.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.170
Create little mental connections
or stories between the letters and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.000
their meaning to strengthen your
memory methods of solving when

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.285
you see a question in the exam.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.929
How do you tackle it?

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.190
It's mostly about sharp
recall and clever elimination.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.010
The first method is direct recall.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.390
You see the abbreviation and the
full form just pops into your head.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.855
If you've studied well, this is the
fastest, most heroic way to answer.

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.135
But what if you're not sure?

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:32.405
Then you use the second
method elimination.

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:35.885
Look at the multiple choice
options very carefully.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.185
Get rid of any options
that are obviously wrong.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:43.355
Make no sense in a banking context,
or sound like something your

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:45.215
uncle made up at a family dinner.

00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:49.085
The third method involves
looking for contextual clues.

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:54.365
Sometimes the question itself gives you
a hint about whether the term is related

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:56.735
to payments, loans, or regulations.

00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:02.345
Use these clues to narrow down your
choices, shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:05.975
To become a master, you
need some smart techniques.

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:10.685
First try categorization group
similar abbreviations together.

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.550
For example, put all payment related
ones like N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S-I-M-P-S

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.170
together put all regulatory
bodies like RBI sebi together.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.039
This organized approach is
fantastic for memorization.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.260
Next, use flashcards.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.460
Create physical or digital ones
with the short form on one side

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.260
and the full form on the other.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.180
Quiz yourself regularly.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.100
Also make daily practice a habit.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.390
Just a few minutes each day to
review a list will work wonders.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.590
And don't forget the power
of mnemonics for tricky ones.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.860
Invent a silly sentence or
a funny story to remember.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.640
The full form.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.580
The funnier it is, the
better you'll remember it.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.310
Lastly, practice with mock tests.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.320
This shows you exactly which
abbreviations you are weak in, so

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.210
you can focus your efforts there.

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.969
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.919
All right, listen up, because this
is where people make silly mistakes

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.450
first, a very common error is
confusing, similar abbreviations.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.590
People mix up things that look or sound
alike, like NEFT and RTGS or KYC and KCC.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.740
Pay close attention to
the small differences.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.700
Second, do not guess based
on the first letter only.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.200
This is a trap.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.460
Many financial words start
with the same letter, so always

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.065
recall the complete full form.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.090
Third, don't ignore the context.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.570
A term might have a general
meaning, but you need its

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.460
specific financial definition.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.250
Always think within the world of banking.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.050
And finally, please, please overlook
minor differences in the options.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.420
One option might say, reserve Bank
of India and another reserved Bank of

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.240
India that one little D can cost you.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.960
Marks read every option
with the focus of a hawk.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.395
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:12.405
So to quickly summarize everything
with our W Edge framework, what

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:14.025
are financial abbreviations?

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:17.294
They are short forms of
long financial phrases.

00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:22.515
Why do we use them to ensure quick,
clear, and efficient communication?

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:28.395
When are they applied in daily banking
reports, news and official documents.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.890
Where are they found everywhere in
banking, investment, and insurance?

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.270
Who uses them?

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:41.239
Everyone from bankers and investors to
regulators and customers like you and me.

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:43.010
And how do they work?

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.719
By simply representing complex terms
with a few letters for easy use.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.970
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.880
Let's look at an example question.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.300
What is the full form of EMIA?

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:02.990
Equal monthly installment B, easy
money, income C, electronic money

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.855
interface D, every month interest.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.630
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.470
Okay.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.530
The question asks for
the full form of EMI.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.910
This is a word we hear all the time
when taking any loan, isn't it?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.740
It stands for that fixed payment you
make to the bank every single month.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.160
It has to be an installment, paid monthly.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.960
Let's look at the options.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.390
Option A is equal monthly installment.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.320
This sounds perfect as the
amount is the same each month.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.539
Option B, easy money.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.220
Income is nonsense.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.200
Option C, electronic money
interface sounds technical but is

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.230
not EMI and option D every month.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:52.810
Interest is incomplete because the payment
includes principle two, not just interest.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.060
So clearly A is our answer.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.420
Correct answer.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.540
A next example question.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.640
KYC is a crucial process in banking
for verifying customer identity.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.070
What does KYC stand for?

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.170
A, keep your cash.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.390
B, know your customer.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.940
C. Key yield calculation.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.190
D. Kindly your credit.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.500
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.180
The question asks for the full
form of KYC and even gives a hint.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.850
It's about verifying customer identity.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.260
This is that process where the bank
asks for your ID and address proof.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.420
They want to know you.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.280
So let's check the options.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.670
Option A, keep your cash is just a phrase.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:44.375
Option C key healed calculation is
related to investments not identity.

00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:48.095
Option D, kindly your
credit is just gibberish.

00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:51.425
Option B, know your customer perfectly.

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:55.115
Describes the process of a bank,
getting to know who its clients

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:57.425
are to prevent illegal activities.

00:09:57.755 --> 00:09:59.720
It's a perfect match, correct?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.795
Answer B one more for good measure.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.450
Question, which of the following
is the correct full form of

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.150
NPA in the context of banking?

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.000
A Non-performing asset?

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.090
B. National Payment Authority.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.430
C. New public account.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.589
D net profit analysis.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.370
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.880
The question asks for the full form of
NPA, specifically in a banking context.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.319
This is a term you hear in the
news when they talk about a bank's

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:39.439
bad loans, and NPA is a loan.

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:44.205
That has gone bad because the borrower
has stopped paying for 90 days.

00:10:44.715 --> 00:10:50.595
The asset, which is the loan, is no longer
performing or earning income for the bank.

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:52.395
Let's see the options.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:55.575
Option A is non-performing asset.

00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:58.885
This is exactly what we just described.

00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:03.265
Option B, national Payment
Authority is unrelated.

00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:10.255
Option C, new public account is not a
standard term and option D, net profit

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.535
analysis is an accounting method.

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:17.425
So the correct answer is
clearly a correct answer.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.045
A thank you.

00:11:19.165 --> 00:11:20.665
See you in the next lecture.
