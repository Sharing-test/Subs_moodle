00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on monetary policy.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.450
This tutorial is part power tool,
part brain gym for understanding

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.060
this concept, concept explanation.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
Think of monetary policy as the steering
wheel of an economy, primarily handled

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.605
by a country's central bank in India.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:25.195
Our superstar driver is the
Reserve Bank of India or RBI.

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:31.134
Its main job is to control the supply
of money and credit floating around to

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:36.415
achieve big goals like price stability,
which is a fancy way of saying keeping

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.330
inflation from eating our savings.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:43.055
It also aims for economic growth
and a stable exchange rate.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:49.415
The RBI has a whole toolkit to either pump
more money into the system or suck it out.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.525
This influences interest rates,
how much banks are lending,

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:55.715
and the entire economic vibe.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:59.370
When the RB. Wants to
give the economy a boost.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.220
It makes money cheaper and easier to get.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.530
That's an expansionary policy.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.929
But when the economy is overheating
like an old laptop and inflation

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.370
is rising, it makes money more
expensive and harder to get, which

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.560
we call a contractionary policy.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.210
Real world relevance.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.465
Now, why should you care about this?

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.780
Because understanding monetary policy is
super important as it directly impacts

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.850
how banks operate, the interest rates on
your loans and the whole economic climate.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.410
It's crucial for figuring out
credit risk and market liquidity.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.170
Let's quickly touch on
the topics it covers.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.120
Monetary policy decisions are the main
reason for interest rate movements.

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:47.014
You see in banks for loans and deposits.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:51.544
The policy also dictates credit
availability, which is how

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:55.054
much money banks have to lend
and how much it'll cost you.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:57.845
A big one is inflation management.

00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.074
Understanding these trends
driven by policy is essential

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:03.395
for financial planning.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:08.315
It also provides an economic growth
outlook as policy signals give

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:12.695
us clues about the central bank's
thinking on expansion or contraction.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.860
For banks, regulatory compliance is key.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.900
Being aware of policy changes ensures
they are following RBI's rules.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.270
And finally, market liquidity as policy
actions affect the availability of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.590
funds in the interbank market, which
is vital for a bank's day-to-day

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.500
work Breakdown of question types.

00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:36.125
Based on patterns from your exam.

00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:40.054
Questions on this topic come
in a few predictable flavors.

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:45.935
Around 30% of the time you'll see
definition or concept-based questions.

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:51.994
For example, what is the primary objective
of monetary policy, or which body is

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:54.484
responsible for monetary policy in India?

00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:56.445
The most frequent type at.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.850
35% are instrument based questions.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.769
These might ask which of the
following is a quantitative tool or

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.869
quiz you on the current reper rate?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.369
About 20% of questions are
impact or effect based.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.839
Testing your logic with something
like what is the likely effect of

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.510
an increase in CRR on bank lending?

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.315
A smaller slice, about 10% are
role or function-based questions.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500
Like asking about the job of the
monetary policy committee and finally,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.750
a small but vital 5% are current
affairs or latest rates questions,

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.250
which require you to be up to date with
the last MPC meetings, announcements.

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:40.965
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:45.915
Monetary policy doesn't really have
mathematical formulas, but it has

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:50.295
key relationships that work like
formulas for understanding its magic.

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:53.385
Under policy rates,
you have the repo rate.

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:57.855
The rate at which RBI lends short
term money to commercial banks.

00:03:58.245 --> 00:04:00.345
The reverse reper rate is the opposite.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:03.825
The rate at which RBI borrows
from commercial banks.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.410
The marginal standing facility or MSF
rate is for when banks need emergency

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.850
overnight funds from RBI and the
bank rate is for long-term lending

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.280
from RBI to banks without collateral.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.650
Then we have reserve ratios.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.170
The cash reserve ratio or CRR is the
percentage of a bank's total deposits

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.990
that it must keep with the RBI as cash.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.570
The statutory liquidity ratio or SLR
is the percentage of deposits banks

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.700
must maintain in liquid assets like
cash, gold, or approved securities.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.970
We also have open market operations
or o os, which is just the RBI buying

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.900
or selling government securities
to inject or absorb liquidity.

00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:52.614
The monetary policy stance can be
accommodative, focusing on growth

00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:56.965
with lower rates, or hawkish focusing
on inflation with higher rates.

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.784
A neutral stance means
a balanced approach.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:06.715
Just remember if inflation goes up, rates
go up, if growth goes down, rates go down.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.925
Methods of solving.

00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:13.755
Solving these questions is all about
understanding cause and effect.

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:16.605
First, identify the objective.

00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:22.245
Figure out if the policy action is meant
to control inflation or boost growth.

00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:24.525
Second, categorize the instrument.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.560
Is it a quantitative tool affecting
the whole money supply or a qualitative

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.870
one targeting specific sectors.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.020
Third, trace the impact on liquidity.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.990
How does the tool change
the amount of money?

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.770
Banks have?

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.620
Fourth, predict the effect on lending.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.180
How does this change affect a
bank's ability to lend and the cost

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.010
of borrowing for people like us?

00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:52.284
Fifth, assess the macroeconomic outcome.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:56.575
What's the final impact on
inflation growth and jobs?

00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.145
And finally, relate to
monetary policy stance.

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:04.615
Connect the action to an expansionary
or contractionary policy.

00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:07.284
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:10.555
Here are some smart
techniques to make you faster.

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.555
Remember, repo equals lending.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:17.485
Reverse repo equals borrowing
to get the money flow right.

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:21.635
C-R-R-S-L-R up equals
less money for banks.

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:25.325
If these ratios go up,
banks have less to lend.

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:29.405
For o os remember, buy equals inject.

00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:31.145
Sell equals absorb.

00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:34.775
When RBI buys securities,
it injects money.

00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:37.135
When it sells, it absorbs money.

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:43.075
A golden rule is inflation up rates
up and growth down, rates down.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.755
Also, try to think from the bank's
perspective, how does a policy

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:52.045
change affect a commercial bank's
costs or its ability to lend?

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:55.315
And most importantly, focus on the why.

00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:57.445
Don't just memorize definitions.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.260
Understand why a tool is
used in a certain situation.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.140
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.290
Let's clear up some
common areas of confusion.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.830
A big one is mixing up
repo and reverse repo.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.670
Remember, repo is when
banks borrow from the RBI.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.025
Reverse repo is when the
RBI borrows from banks.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.045
Another mistake is misunderstanding.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:27.075
CRR versus S-L-R-C-R-R is only
cash kept with the R-B-I-S-L-R

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:31.995
includes cash, gold and securities
that the ban keeps with itself.

00:07:32.475 --> 00:07:36.675
Also don't believe monetary
policy is the only economic tool.

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:41.295
It works alongside fiscal policy,
which is managed by the government.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.450
Many friends assume policy
changes have an immediate effect,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.700
but there's always a time lag.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.420
Lastly, don't confuse
bank rate with repo rate.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.420
Repo is short-term and needs collateral.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.220
Bank rate is long-term and
doesn't W Edge framework Summary.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.210
So to wrap it all up with a quick WH
framework, what is monetary policy?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.500
It's the process by which the
central bank controls money and

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.810
credit to achieve economic goals.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.760
Why is it important?

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.560
It is crucial for maintaining price
stability, promoting economic growth,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.900
and ensuring financial stability.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.670
When is it applied?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.680
Periodically in bi-monthly MPC
meetings or whenever the economy

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.610
needs a course correction.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.840
Where is it applied?

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.160
At the national level influencing
the entire financial system.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.780
Who runs the show?

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.470
The Reserve Bank of India and
its monetary policy committee.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.240
And how is it applied?

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.400
Through tools like policy rates, reserve
ratios, and open market operations.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.560
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.965
Alright, let's test your
understanding with some examples.

00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:55.735
Example, one question.

00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:59.875
Which of the following is the
primary objective of the Reserve

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.825
Bank of India's monetary policy?

00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:04.645
A. Maximizing government revenue.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.225
B. Maintaining price stability.

00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:11.875
C. Promoting exports only
D. Reducing public debt.

00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:14.980
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:16.064 --> 00:09:17.204
Let's break it down.

00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:20.025
The question asks for
the primary objective.

00:09:20.444 --> 00:09:23.655
We know the core goals are
price, stability, growth,

00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:25.245
and financial stability.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:29.204
Option A, government revenue
is a fiscal policy job.

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:31.305
Option C is too narrow.

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.845
Policy aims for overall
growth, not just exports.

00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:38.625
Option D, public debt is
also a fiscal concern.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.860
So option B, maintaining price
stability or controlling inflation

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.500
is the main mandate given to the RBI.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.960
The correct answer is option B.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.250
Example two.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.240
Question.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.520
If the reserve bank of India, RBI
decides to increase the cash reserve

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.560
ratio, CRR, what is the likely
immediate impact on commercial banks?

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.710
A, their lending capacity will increase.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.380
B, their cost of funds will decrease.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.290
C, their lending capacity will decrease.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.840
D, they will have more surplus funds.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.930
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.400
Let's solve this.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.060
The question is about the
impact of A CRR increase.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.700
CRR is the cash banks must park with
the RBI and they earn no interest on it.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.060
So if CRR increases, banks have to keep
more of their money with the RBI, this

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.170
directly means they have less money
available to lend out to customers.

00:10:37.455 --> 00:10:41.235
So looking at the options,
A and D are clearly wrong.

00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:45.705
Their lending capacity will not increase
and they'll have fewer surplus funds.

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.045
Option B is also incorrect.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:53.085
The correct answer is C. Their lending
capacity will decrease because a larger

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.155
chunk of their deposits is locked away.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:55.930
With the RBI.

00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:58.515
Example three question.

00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:02.835
Which of the following is a
quantitative tool of monetary policy

00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:06.165
used by the RBIA model persuasion?

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:08.025
B, direct action.

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:13.815
C. Open market Operations, O Os
D. Credit rationing Understand the

00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:15.795
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:17.365
Let's analyze this.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:21.115
The question wants us to
identify a quantitative tool.

00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:25.975
Remember, quantitative tools affect
the overall volume of money while

00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:28.285
qualitative tools affect its direction.

00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:30.025
Let's look at our options.

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.775
Moral persuasion, direct
action, and credit rationing

00:11:33.805 --> 00:11:35.215
