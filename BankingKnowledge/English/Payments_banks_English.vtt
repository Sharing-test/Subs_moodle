00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on payment banks.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.570
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.810
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
So what are these payment banks
everyone is talking about?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.760
They are a new type of bank
in India, a brainchild of the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.125
Reserve Bank of India, or RBI.

00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:28.645
Created to make banking services easier
to get, especially for our friends who

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.564
don't have a traditional bank account.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:36.504
Just think of them as simplified banks,
like a diet version of a big bank.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:41.694
Their main job is accepting deposits
and helping you make payments.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.190
They can take small deposits currently
up to a cool 200,000 rupees per

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.660
customer and let you make payments
and send money home through all the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.580
usual channels like mobile banking,
debit cards, and internet banking.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.480
But, and this is a big but unlike the big.

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:04.565
Commercial banks, payment banks
cannot give you loans or issue.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:09.215
Those tempting credit cards, their
number one mission, their reason for

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.215
existing is to boost financial inclusion.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.505
They are here to provide basic
banking to people who have been left

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:21.335
out, like migrant workers, small
businesses, and low income households.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.315
Real world relevance.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:28.025
Understanding these banks is super
important because they're shaking

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.495
things up in the banking world.

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:32.604
Affecting both competition and teamwork.

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:37.764
As an officer, you'd be looking at
their role in financial inclusion and

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:42.384
figuring out how they fit in with or
compete against traditional banks.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.134
First up, they represent
a new shift in banking.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:50.369
These banks are creating brand
new opportunities for delivering

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.610
financial services in ways we haven't.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.740
Seen before.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.850
Second, think about their impact
on the financial ecosystem.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.960
They're changing the relationship
between traditional banks, buzzing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.429
FinTech companies, and even telecom
operators in the financial sector.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.320
Third, their most important role
is driving financial inclusion.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.240
They are the champions helping bring
banking services to populations that were

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.980
previously unserved, including migrant
workers and low income households.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:25.385
And finally, of course, their
relevance for competitive exams.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:30.905
Knowing about payment banks is absolutely
crucial for your exam as it shows you

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:35.704
are up to date with evolving banking
models and financial inclusion efforts.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:41.195
Breakdown of question types based on
what we've seen in past papers for

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:45.755
the exam, questions about payment
banks usually come in a few flavors.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.995
About 40% of the time you'll get
definition or purpose-based questions.

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:54.655
These will ask simple things
like, what is a payment bank?

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.345
What is their main goal, or,
which committee recommended them?

00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:03.895
Around 30% of questions will be about
their permitted activities or limitations.

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:08.225
These are the tricky ones, focusing
on what they can and cannot do,

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.945
like the deposit limits or the
fact that they can't lend money.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.755
Then about 15% are regulatory aspects.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.345
These questions will test your knowledge
about who regulates them, which is the

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.555
RBI or their licensing and capital needs.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:28.545
A smaller 10% of questions might be
about examples or the first payment

00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:33.405
bank asking you to name the first
one or identify some existing ones.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:38.805
And finally, a tiny 5% might be
comparison with other banks where

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:42.645
you'll have to compare them with small
finance banks or commercial banks.

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:45.225
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:50.295
Now, since this is a conceptual topic,
there are no maths formulas to memorize.

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:51.315
Thank goodness.

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:55.875
The tricks are all about remembering
key facts and what makes them unique.

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:57.915
First, the deposit limit.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:02.355
Always remember the current
maximum, which is 200,000 rupees.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.329
Second, the golden Rule.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.250
No lending payment.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.660
Banks cannot, I repeat, cannot
lend money or issue credit cards.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.880
This is their biggest defining feature.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.409
Third, their core business is to
focus on payments and remittances.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.790
They are all about helping you pay
your bills and transfer money easily.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.380
Their primary objective is, you
guessed it, financial inclusion.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.960
And who was the genius behind this idea?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.030
The N Moore Committee.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.290
Remember that name?

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:36.995
Finally for the number crunchers, they
need a minimum capital of a hundred

00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:39.515
crow rupees as paid up equity capital.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:45.195
Methods of solving to really get a
grip on payment banks for your exam,

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:46.995
you need a structured approach.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:49.424
First, understand the why.

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:52.965
Start by understanding the
whole reason they were created.

00:04:53.174 --> 00:04:57.104
Financial inclusion for people
who were unbanked or underbanked.

00:04:57.535 --> 00:05:00.115
Next, identify core activities.

00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:05.755
Make a clear mental list of what they
can do, accept demand deposits in current

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:10.975
and savings accounts, issue debit cards,
handle remittances, and offer internet and

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:14.125
mobile banking then, and this is critical.

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:16.345
Identify key limitations.

00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:19.825
Make an even clearer list
of what they cannot do.

00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:25.195
No offering loans, no issuing credit
cards, no accepting NRI Deposits

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:27.175
and no setting up subsidiaries.

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.055
Also note the regulatory framework.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:34.615
Remember the minimum capital, the
naate more committee, and that the

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:37.165
RBI is the big boss regulating them.

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:40.525
You should also be able to
distinguish from others.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:45.345
Compare payment banks with small
finance banks and universal banks to see

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.415
their special place in the ecosystem.

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:52.845
And lastly, memorize key figures and
facts like the deposit limit and minimum

00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:55.845
capital shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:59.625
Let's talk about some smart techniques
to keep in your back pocket.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.054
First, the payments only rule.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:06.705
If a question ever asks about lending
or credit cards for payment banks,

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.494
the answer almost always, a big no.

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:11.325
It's their biggest restriction.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.445
Second, the two lack limit.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.465
Just connect the words payment
bank with the 200,000 Rupe

00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:19.205
deposit limit in your mind.

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:22.625
Third, a little memory trick M for more.

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:24.965
M for micro, the naate.

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:28.685
More committee recommended these
micro or small scale banks.

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:31.715
Fourth, remember debit not credit.

00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:35.495
They give you a debit card to
spend what you have, but not a

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.175
credit to spend what you don't.

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.355
And finally, simplify
their function to this.

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:43.544
No loans, just deposits and transfers.

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.424
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:51.525
All right, listen up my friend, because
this is where many people get confused.

00:06:52.005 --> 00:06:55.365
A common mistake is confusing
with small finance banks.

00:06:55.724 --> 00:07:00.525
People assume payment banks can also lend
money, just like small finance banks.

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:03.164
Remember, they strictly do not lend.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.080
Another is believing they can
accept unlimited deposits.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.000
There is a very clear limit.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.040
Currently at 200,000 Rupees don't
fall for the misconception that

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.780
they can be issuing credit cards.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.060
They can only issue debit cards.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.960
Also, they are not permitted
to accept NRI deposits.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.680
And finally, they cannot set
up subsidiaries to get into

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.660
non-banking financial activities.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.940
WH Framework Summary.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.280
So to wrap this all up, let's
do a quick wedged summary.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.140
What are they?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.390
They are specialized banks offering
basic banking, mostly deposits

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.700
and payments without any lending.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.859
Why do they exist?

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.900
Their main goal is to promote
financial inclusion for the unbanked

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.849
and underbanked people in India.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.099
When were they introduced?

00:07:55.505 --> 00:07:59.405
They came into being based on the
recommendations of the Nazi Kate

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.955
Moore committee back in 2014.

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:03.935
Where do they operate?

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:08.705
They operate all across India
using technology to reach

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.195
everywhere, especially remote areas.

00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:13.175
Who benefits from them?

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:18.275
Their primary customers are
individuals, small businesses, migrant

00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:20.525
workers, and low income households.

00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:22.355
And how do they do it?

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:27.725
By accepting small deposits, making
remittances easy, and providing

00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:29.615
digital payment solutions for everyone.

00:08:30.645 --> 00:08:32.355
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:34.784
Example, one question.

00:08:35.145 --> 00:08:39.705
Which of the following activities is not
permitted for payment banks in India?

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:44.715
A accepting demand deposits up
to INR to lack per customer.

00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:47.565
B, issuing ATM debit cards.

00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:50.085
C. Providing remittance services.

00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:55.035
D. Lending money to individuals
and small businesses Understand the

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.255
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.790
Okay, let's break this down.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.220
Step one, analyze the question.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.750
It's asking what activity payment
banks are not allowed to do.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.300
Step two, recall their functions.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.410
We know they are all about
deposits and payments, and their

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.630
biggest restriction is no lending.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.880
Step three, look at the options.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.770
Option A is allowed.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.480
Option B is allowed.

00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:28.795
Option C is a core activity, but option
D lending money is explicitly forbidden.

00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:36.025
So step four, we conclude our answer,
correct answer D example two question.

00:09:36.324 --> 00:09:41.215
What is the current maximum deposit limit
per customer for payment banks in India?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:49.610
A-I-N-R-A hundred thousand BINR,
200,000 CINR, 500,000 D. No limit.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.555
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.729
This one is a direct question
about a specific number.

00:09:56.939 --> 00:10:00.689
Step one, understand what's
required, the deposit limit.

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:03.240
Step two, recall the key facts.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.620
One of the most important numbers
to remember is their deposit limit.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.079
Step three, state the correct limit.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.390
The RBI has set this maximum limit
at 200,000 rupees per customer.

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.170
So step four, we conclude
our answer, correct.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.430
Answer b. Example three question.

00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:27.500
The concept of payment banks in India was
primarily recommended by which committee

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:36.620
A, rag Raja committee B, NA committee C,
committee D, or Patel Committee understand

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.930
the question before moving to explanation.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.859
This question is about the
origin story of payment banks.

00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:45.500
Step one, identify what's needed.

00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:46.790
The name of the committee.

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:50.869
Step two, access your knowledge
of banking committees in India.

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:54.290
Step three, link the right
committee to Payment Banks.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:59.300
The N Moore committee was the one that
strongly recommended setting up both

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.609
payment banks and small finance banks.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.040
So step four, we have our answer,
correct answer C. Thank you.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.750
See you in the next lecture.
