00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on types of risks.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.180
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:17.895
So in the big bustling world
of banking, what is this risk

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:19.485
everyone keeps talking about?

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:21.525
It's not a monster, don't worry.

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:25.994
Risk simply means the possibility
of something unexpected happening

00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:30.255
that could lead to a financial
loss or some other negative impact.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:31.785
Think of it like this.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:37.275
Banks are basically jugglers, but instead
of balls, they are juggling your money.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:42.675
My money and big financial transactions,
so they are constantly exposed

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.595
to all sorts of uncertainties.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.335
Understanding these risks is absolutely
critical for banks to operate

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:54.345
safely, and of course, profitably
different types of risks pop up from

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.965
various parts of their business.

00:00:56.144 --> 00:01:00.165
From lending money to a hopeful
entrepreneur to managing massive

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:03.765
investments and even just
handling daily transactions.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:10.505
So the core job of a bank besides giving
us long cues is to identify, measure,

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.425
and manage these risks, to protect its
assets and ensure it doesn't suddenly

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.175
vanish one day real world relevance.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
Now you might ask, why is it so important
for banking professionals to understand

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.310
these different types of risks?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.840
Let me tell you, it's not just for
impressing people at parties First,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.120
it helps in informed decision making.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.240
The purpose here is to make
smart lending decisions.

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:40.985
The benefit is that it assists
in evaluating potential borrowers

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:45.395
much more effectively, so the bank
doesn't lend money to someone who

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.645
plans to run away to a remote island.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.155
Second, it's all about
financial health management.

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.895
Its purpose is to support the management
of the bank's overall financial health.

00:01:55.895 --> 00:02:00.545
And the benefit is that this contributes
to long-term financial stability.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.070
Then we have risk identification.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.680
The goal is to detect potential issues in
transactions and operations, allowing for

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.780
proactive risk mitigation before a small
problem becomes a newspaper headline.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.609
And finally, protection.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.530
Its purpose is to shield the bank and its
customers, and the benefit, my friend,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.590
is preventing those nasty, unexpected
losses, breakdown of question types.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:29.625
Based on what you might see in your exam.

00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:33.675
Questions on types of risks
show up in a few common avatars.

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.635
About 40% are straightforward
definition based questions.

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:41.895
They'll ask for the direct definition
of a risk or give you a definition

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.455
and ask you to name the risk.

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:48.465
For instance, what is the risk associated
with a borrower failing to repay a loan?

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:49.425
Easy peasy.

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:53.475
Another 30% are scenario based
identification questions.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:57.515
Here, they'll give you a little
story, a situation, and you have to

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.735
play detective and identify the risk.

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:04.595
An example would be a bank experiences,
a system failure leading to

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:06.455
incorrect transaction processing.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.225
Which type of risk is this?

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:12.905
Then about 20% are classification
or categorization questions.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000
These involve putting specific
events into the right risk bucket

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:21.500
or finding the odd one out, like
which of the following is typically

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.570
categorized under operational risk?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.890
And the final 10% are impact on
mitigation strategy questions,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.880
which focus on the consequences
of a risk, all how to reduce it.

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:37.160
For example, implementing robust internal
controls primarily helps mitigate

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.785
which type of risk formulas and tricks.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:42.945
Now for the good part.

00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:46.935
While there are no mathematical
formulas here, thank goodness the

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:50.955
tricks are all about understanding
the core personality of each risk.

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:55.960
For credit risk, just think C, for the
customer's ability to repay the loan.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.630
For market risk.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.950
Think m for market movements
like the crazy dance of prices

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.350
and rates for operational risk.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.360
Think O for operations.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.010
That means problems with people,
processes, systems, or even random

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.530
external events for liquidity risk.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.420
Think L for liquidity, which is the bank's
ability to meet its short-term payment

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.670
duties without having a panic attack.

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:22.315
For interest rate risk.

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:27.145
Think I for interest rate changes that
affect the bank's income or value.

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:32.275
And finally, for compliance risk, think
C for compliance with all the rules

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:34.495
and laws to avoid getting into trouble.

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:36.475
Methods of solving.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.790
To effectively identify and understand
these risks when a question is thrown

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.190
at you, just follow these simple steps.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.130
First, you must understand
the core definition.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.450
Memorize the fundamental meaning
of each major risk type, credit

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.070
market, operational liquidity,
interest rate, and compliance.

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:56.875
Next.

00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.415
When you get a scenario, identify
the source of uncertainty.

00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:03.565
Ask yourself what is
causing the potential loss?

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:08.095
Is it a borrower who can't pay a
wild market fluctuation and internal

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:10.195
system failure or a legal issue?

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:12.415
Then categorize by impact.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:16.405
Think about what part of the
bank's world is primarily affected.

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.885
Is it the loan book, the
investment portfolio, daily

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:22.105
operations, or its legal standing?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.315
Also, you must learn to
differentiate similar risks.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.020
Pay close attention to
the small differences.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.010
For instance, both operational
and compliance risks can seem

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.030
internal, but operational risk
is about failures in processes or

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.140
systems, while compliance risk is
specifically about breaking the rules.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.990
And lastly, relate to banking functions.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.000
Connect the risk type to the banking
activity it impacts most, like lending for

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.190
credit risk or trading for market risk.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.700
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.630
For some smart techniques,
try keyword association link

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.460
specific words to risk types.

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.020
If you say loan default borrower
or repayment, your brain should

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.940
light up and scream credit risk.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.219
If you say stock prices, interest rates,
currency exchange, or commodity prices,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.140
that's your queue for market risk.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.610
Words like fraud.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.480
System error, human error process
failure on natural disaster point

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.220
directly to operational risk.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.510
If the problem is about cash flow
funding or an inability to meet

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.820
obligations, that's liquidity risk.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.950
The phrase interest rate fluctuations or
talk about bond prices and net interest

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.380
margin is all about interest rate risk.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.590
And finally, if you see laws, regulations,
fines, penalties, or legal action, that

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.690
is a hundred percent compliance risk.

00:06:44.924 --> 00:06:47.594
Also use the elimination strategy.

00:06:48.044 --> 00:06:52.155
If you're not sure, just eliminate
the options that clearly don't fit,

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:57.044
and always focus on the primary
cause of the problem in the scenario.

00:06:57.945 --> 00:06:59.835
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.970
Be careful of these common traps.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.380
A big one is confusing
operational and compliance risk.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.050
Remember, operational risk is about
things going wrong inside people,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.720
processes, systems, compliance.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.720
Risk is about failing to
follow external rules.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.240
A system failure is an operational risk,
even if it leads to a compliance breach.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.670
The failure itself is operational.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.360
Also don't overlook reputational risk.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.610
While it's not always the main category,
many other risks like operational

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.220
failures can smash a bank's reputation.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.610
It's often an outcome,
not the primary cause.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.720
Another mix up is between
market and interest rate risk.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.085
Interest rate risk is just one part
of the bigger market risk family.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.049
Market risk is broader and includes
all market price movements.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.099
Lastly, don't assume all
losses are operational.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.260
A loss from a loan default is pure
credit risk, even if the loan approval

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.359
process itself was a bit sloppy, the
direct cause is what matters most.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.760
W framework summary.

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.870
So to summarize it all
nicely, what is risk?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.219
It's the possibility of financial
loss from unexpected events.

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:21.905
Why is it important?

00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:26.495
It is absolutely essential for
banks to manage their stability and

00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:29.135
profitability and to protect their assets.

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:34.565
When is it applied continuously
across every single banking operation?

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:37.715
From lending to trading,
where does it exist?

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:42.515
It's pervasive in all areas of
banking, finance, and investment.

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:44.164
Who is concerned with it?

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:50.285
Banks, financial institutions, regulators,
and investors are all worried about

00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:52.775
managing it and how is it managed?

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:58.115
It's identified, measured, monitored,
and then mitigated through various

00:08:58.115 --> 00:09:00.155
smart strategies and controls.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.314
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:04.985
Alright, let's solve some examples.

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:07.385
Example, one question.

00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:11.045
A bank provides a large loan
to a manufacturing company.

00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:15.325
Due to an unexpected economic
downturn, the company faces

00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:19.015
severe financial difficulties and
is unable to make its schedule.

00:09:19.015 --> 00:09:20.005
Loan repayments.

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:24.775
Which type of risk is the bank
primarily exposed to in this scenario?

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.695
A. Market risk.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:28.645
B, operational risk.

00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.355
C. Credit risk.

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:32.155
D, liquidity risk.

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:35.695
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:37.345
Let's analyze this.

00:09:37.714 --> 00:09:41.795
The heart of the problem is the
borrower's inability to repay a loan.

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:44.824
This is about the credit
worthiness of the company.

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:49.235
Market risk is about market prices,
which is not the main issue.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.915
Operational risk is about internal
failures, not a borrower failing.

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:57.405
Liquidity risk is about
the bank's own cash flow.

00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:01.965
The risk is tied directly to the
borrower's failure to pay, which is

00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:07.005
the textbook definition of credit
risk, correct answer, C, credit risk.

00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:09.285
Example two question.

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:14.415
A major software glitch in a bank's
online banking system causes thousands of

00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:16.530
transactions to be incorrectly processed.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.530
Leading to customer complaints
and financial discrepancies.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.150
What type of risk does this situation
primarily represent for the bank?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.010
A, compliance risk.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.900
B, interest rate risk.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.730
C, operational risk.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.590
D. Reputational risk.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.670
Understand the question before
moving to explanation here.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.730
The problem comes from
a soft GL in a system.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.240
This points to a failure
inside the bank's own house.

00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:47.885
While it might cause compliance or
reputational issues later, the root

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:52.204
cause is not a breach of law itself,
nor is it related to interest rates.

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:56.255
The direct cause is a failure
in the bank's internal system.

00:10:56.615 --> 00:11:00.905
This is a classic case of operational
risk, which covers losses from

00:11:00.905 --> 00:11:05.435
failed internal processes, people
and systems, correct answer C,

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:08.255
operational risk, example three.

00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:09.185
Question.

00:11:09.575 --> 00:11:14.405
A bank holds a significant portfolio
of government bonds unexpectedly.

00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:18.965
The central bank raises interest rates
sharply causing the market value of

00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:23.045
these bonds to fall significantly
leading to a potential loss for

00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:24.965
the bank if it needs to sell them.

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:27.455
Which type of risk is the bank facing?

00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:29.074
A credit risk.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.665
B, market risk.

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.465
C, liquidity risk.

00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:34.235
D, compliance risk.

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:37.505
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:38.975
Let's break this down.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:43.085
The scenario is about a change
in interest rates causing the

00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:45.035
market value of bonds to fall.

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:49.175
This is all about sensitivity
to financial market movements.

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:52.925
Credit risk is about default,
which is not the issue here.

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:57.695
Liquidity and compliance risks are
irrelevant to bond value fluctuations.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.625
The loss is due to adverse
movements in market prices,

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.605
specifically interest rates.

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:08.495
This falls squarely under the big
umbrella of market risk, correct answer.

00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:09.965
B, market risk.

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:10.805
Thank you.

00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:12.575
See you in the next lecture.
