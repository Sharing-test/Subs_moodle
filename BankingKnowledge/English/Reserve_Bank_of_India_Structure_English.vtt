00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.980
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on Reserve Bank of India structure.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.950
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.070
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.750
First things first.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.430
What is this RBI?

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.500
We keep talking about the Reserve
Bank of India or RBI is the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.720
big boss of all banks in India.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.630
It's our central bank, established
on April 1st, 1935 under the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.345
Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934.

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:39.515
Think of it as the guardian of the Indian
financial system playing a super crucial

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.975
role in its development and regulation.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:46.655
The structure of the RBI is
designed very carefully to make

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:51.065
sure it can do its job properly
and without too much interference.

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:54.105
So who runs this show?

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:58.665
The RBI's Affairs are governed
by a central board of directors.

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:01.815
Now, this isn't your
Neighborhood Society meeting.

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:05.625
This board is appointed by the
government of India following

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.545
the rules of the RBI Act.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:12.795
The structure has two types of directors,
the full-timers and the part-timers,

00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:17.295
or as they're officially called
official and non-official directors.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.880
Let's look at the
official directors first.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.100
These are the full-time bosses.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.289
At the very top, we have the governor,
the chief executive of the RBI,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.870
responsible for all the big management
and policy decisions helping the governor.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.580
We have the deputy governors.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
There can be a maximum of
four Deputy governors each

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.710
handling different functions.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:44.385
Then we have the non-official directors.

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:48.525
These folks are appointed to
bring in different viewpoints from

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.235
various sectors of the economy.

00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:54.195
It's like getting advice from all
the wise people in the village.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:59.895
This group includes four directors from
the local boards, one from each of the

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:02.385
four local boards located in Mumbai.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:07.105
Kohl Kata, Chennai, and New Delhi
representing regional interests.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:11.515
Then we have two government officials,
usually from the Ministry of

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:15.775
Finance, appointed by the central
government to keep things coordinated.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:20.725
And finally, there are 10 other directors
nominated by the central government

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:26.035
from fields like industry, finance and
other professions to ensure we have a

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.345
broad range of expertise on the board.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:33.925
This structure ensures RBI remains
independent, but also gets insights

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.935
from the government and other sectors.

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:37.885
Real world relevance.

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:42.685
Now, you might ask, sir, why
should I care about this structure?

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:47.395
Well, my friend, understanding
the RBI structure is absolutely

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:49.040
vital for a banking professional.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
It helps you understand the entire
food chain of financial policy making

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
and regulatory decisions that will
directly affect your daily work.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.489
It gives you a peek behind the
curtain at the governance and decision

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.510
making processes that shape the
financial world you'll be a part of.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.600
Let's break down the key relevance areas.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.730
First, it's about policy formulation,
understanding who is making those

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.620
big monetary policy decisions.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.540
Second is regulatory oversight,
knowing the authority behind all

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.549
the banking rules and regulations.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.100
Third, it's about financial stability,
recognizing the leadership whose job is

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.260
to keep our economy healthy and stable.

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:36.285
It also influences interbank
relations, showing how the RBI

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:40.125
structure guides its interactions
with commercial banks like yours.

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:44.805
Critically, it's about economic
management and knowing who is steering

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.515
the nation's economic direction.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:51.045
And for the ambitious ones, it's
about career progression, helping

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.945
you identify the key roles within
the central banking system itself.

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.119
Breakdown of question types
when it comes to your exam.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.959
Questions on the RBI structure
usually test your knowledge of

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.970
its composition key people and its
foundations based on past patterns.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.649
Let's see what you can expect.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.085
About 40% are direct fact-based questions.

00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:19.245
These are straightforward questions asking
for specific numbers, names, or dates.

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:23.205
For example, how many deputy
governors can the RBI have?

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:27.585
Then about 30% are role and
responsibility questions.

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:32.755
These focus on what different people
or bodies within the RBI do, for

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:37.405
instance, which body is responsible
for the overall governance of the RBI.

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:40.945
Next 20% are composition based questions.

00:04:41.304 --> 00:04:45.445
These ask about the types of members
on the central board or local boards.

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:49.545
A classic example is, which of
the following is not an official

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.645
director of the RBI central board?

00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:56.205
Finally, about 10% are chronological
or historical questions.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:05:00.555
These are less frequent, but can
pop up asking about the year of

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:02.895
establishment or key historical moments.

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:07.425
For example, in which year was the
Reserve Bank of India established?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.290
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.850
For a topic like RBI structure,
there are no complex mathematical

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.470
formulas, thank goodness.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.420
Instead, the tricks are all about
memorizing key numbers, roles,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.860
and the board's composition.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.680
Let's look at the key numbers to remember.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.720
One governor, a maximum of four
deputy governors, four directors

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.100
from local boards, two government
officials, and 10 other directors

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.630
nominated by the government.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.190
This brings the total members of the
central board to between 18 and 21 people

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.380
to remember the board's composition.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.370
You can use a simple mnemonic, just think
of G-D-L-G-O, governor, deputy Local.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.410
Government and others.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.070
A very simple way to recall
the categories of directors.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.310
And please, please
remember the ACT and year.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.040
The RBI Act was in 1934 and
it was established in 1935.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.540
Don't mix them up.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.400
Methods of solving.

00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:12.664
Solving questions on this topic
is mainly about factual recall,

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.825
not complicated problem solving.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:19.385
So the method is all about effective
memorization and understanding

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:24.515
first use categorization, break
down the central board into official

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:28.294
and non-official directors, and
then into their subcategories.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.510
Second, try visual mapping.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.400
Create a mental chart or even draw
one out with the governor at the top.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.840
Then the deputy governors and the central
board below with all its different

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.900
members, flashcards or space repetition.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.190
Are your best friends here?

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.570
Use them for key facts, like
number of deputy governors, and

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.760
finally, use contextual learning.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.175
Understand why these positions exist.

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:58.299
For instance, local boards are there for
regional representation and government

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:02.559
officials are there for coordination,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:06.280
Since this is a knowledge based
topic, shortcuts are really

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.510
about efficient learning.

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.840
Use active recall,
instead of just reading.

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:14.049
Close your notes and try to
list all the director types

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:15.375
and their numbers from memory.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.160
Try Association link numbers to roles.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.570
For example, think of four deputy
governors as the four pillars

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.980
of support for the governor.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.050
Practice questions regularly.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.910
This is non-negotiable.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.470
It reinforces the information and
shows you where you are weak and

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.170
always focus on exceptions or limits.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.120
Pay close attention to words like
maximum as in a maximum of four

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.170
deputy governors because these are
favorite targets for question setters.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:47.945
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.110
All right.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.420
Let's talk about the common potholes.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.000
To avoid a classic mistake is confusing
the establishment here with the act here.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.840
Remember, the act was passed in 1934,
but the bank started its work in 1935.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.610
Another one is getting the number
of directors wrong, so drill

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.200
those numbers into your head.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.330
A common misconception is that RBI
was always fully government owned.

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:22.200
No, it was initially privately owned and
was nationalized in 1949 for your exam.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Focus on its current status,
but know the history.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.349
Don't underestimate the
role of local boards.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.020
They are important for
regional representation.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.070
And finally, don't assume
all directors are full-time.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.659
Only the governor and deputy
governors are the full-time official

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.720
directors, WH framework summary.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.385
So to quickly summarize this
whole thing, what is it?

00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:50.865
The RBI structure refers to the
hierarchy of its governing bodies,

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:53.205
mainly the central board of directors.

00:08:53.655 --> 00:08:58.455
Why does it exist to ensure good
governance, independent policymaking,

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.155
and representation of diverse interests?

00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:03.120
When did the current structure evolve?

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:10.265
It evolved after nationalization in
1949 based on the RBI Act of 1934.

00:09:10.745 --> 00:09:11.825
Where does it operate?

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:15.815
The central board is in Mumbai
with local boards in Mumbai,

00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:18.215
Karta Chennai, and New Delhi.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:19.595
Who is involved?

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:20.410
The governor.

00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:25.805
Deputy governors, government officials,
and various other nominated directors.

00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:27.725
And how does it work?

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:31.805
The central government appoints the
board, and this board collectively

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:37.175
governs the RBI's operations and
policies fully worked out examples.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.275
Let's tackle some examples.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.650
Example, one question.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.850
The central board of directors of
the Reserve Bank of India consists

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:53.980
of how many deputy governors a two B,
three C four D five, understand the

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.290
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.670
Step one is to understand the
question asks for the maximum

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.140
number of deputy governors.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:06.465
Step two is to recall the
composition of official directors.

00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:12.525
The RBI ACT says there can be a governor
and not more than four deputy governors.

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:17.115
So step three is to identify
the correct number, which is

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:20.085
four, correct answer C four.

00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:22.425
Example two question.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:27.495
Which of the following is not an official
director of the RBI Central board?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.810
A, the governor, B, a Deputy Governor, CA
director, nominated from a local board D.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.450
All of the above are official directors.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.870
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.510
First, define official directors.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.830
These are the full-time members.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.480
Second, who are they?

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:53.090
The governor and the deputy governors
third, who are the non-official directors.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.290
Those are the part-timers,
including directors from LOC boards.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.460
So comparing the options, a
director from a local board is a

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.740
non-official director, correct?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.280
Answer.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.310
C. A director nominated
from a local board.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.680
Example three question.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.430
The Reserve Bank of India was
established in which year?

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:20.840
A 1934 B, 1935 C. 1949 D 1950.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.890
Step one is to recall
the key historical facts.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.695
Step two is to differentiate between
the act here and the establishment here.

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:38.755
The act was passed in 1934, but the bank
started its operations in the next year.
