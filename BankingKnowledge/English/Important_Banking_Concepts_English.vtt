Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on important banking concepts.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.610
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.060
First up, let's talk about the big
family of banks concept, explanation.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.030
Types of banks.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.160
So what are banks?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.470
Think of them as the financial heart of
the country, accepting our savings and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.600
then lending it out to create credit.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.450
They are the ultimate money managers,
but not all banks wear the same clothes.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.485
First up, we have the commercial banks.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:46.115
These are the celebrities of the banking
world, like S-B-I-H-D-F-C, and I-C-I-C-I.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:47.795
They do everything.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.415
They take your deposits, savings,
current fixed, and give out loans

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.455
for your car, home or business.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:59.195
Their main goal, of course, to
make a profit, of course, then

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:00.754
come the cooperative banks.

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:03.125
These are more like a community potluck.

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.885
The members are both the
owners and the customers.

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:11.355
They mostly serve their own
members, focusing on rural areas,

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:13.725
agriculture and small businesses.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.805
A good example is the District
Central Cooperative Bank.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.615
Next are the regional rural banks or rbs.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.554
These were created to
be the perfect hybrid.

00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:29.235
You see, they have the local friendly
vibe of a cooperative bank, but the

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:33.735
professional style of a commercial
bank, their mission is to provide

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:37.485
credit to the small and marginal
farmers agricultural laborers.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.895
And artisans in rural India.

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:43.915
We also have small finance banks or sbs.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.805
These are niche players.

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:50.305
The specialists, their goal is
to bring financial services to

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:51.775
those who have been left out.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:56.485
Small business units, marginal
farmers, and the unorganized sector.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:58.615
Finally, payments banks.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.105
These banks are on a strict diet.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:05.845
They can take your deposits up to a
certain limit and give you debit cards.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.049
They are excellent for payments
and sending money, but, and this

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.980
is a big, but they cannot give
loans or issue credit cards.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.040
They're all about
transactions, not credit.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.820
Now, who is the head
of this entire family?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.930
The big boss.

00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:28.035
Reserve Bank of India, RBI and
its functions that would be the

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:30.615
Reserve Bank of India, the RBI.

00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:33.015
It's the central bank of our country.

00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:37.155
Established way back on April 1st, 1935.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.209
Think of the RBI as the principle
of the school regulating monetary

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.380
policy, printing money, and keeping
an eye on all the other banks.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.680
So what does the Superbank do first?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.269
It's the monetary authority.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.760
It's RBI's job to manage the country's
monetary policy to keep prices stable,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
or what we call controlling inflation
while making sure the economy grows.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.090
It is also the regulator and
supervisor of the financial system.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.390
RBI sets the rules of
the game for all banks.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.980
It's like the umpire in a cricket
match, ensuring fair play, protecting

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.100
our deposits, and making sure
we get good banking services.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.040
It is the issuer of currency.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.210
RBI prints and manages all
our currency notes and coins.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.840
It also removes old DON
notes from circulation.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.920
This ensures we always have
enough good quality cash.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.440
It acts as banker to government.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.960
Yes, even the government needs a bank.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.150
RBI handles the accounts for the central
and state governments collecting taxes

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.665
and making payments on their behalf.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.520
It is also the banker to banks.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.640
All other banks have their
accounts with the RBI.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.180
This helps them meet their
reserve requirements and settle

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.980
transactions between themselves.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.780
If a bank is in deep trouble,
RBI Acts as the lender of last

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.700
resort, the final lifeline.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.790
It is also the manager
of foreign exchange.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:09.885
RBI manages the country's foreign currency
reserves under the FEMA Act to help

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:12.105
with international trade and payments.

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:15.285
And finally, it has a developmental role.

00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:20.954
The RBI also works to promote and develop
our financial institutions and markets

00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:23.090
to support overall economic growth.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.215
Now let's dive into one of
RBI's most powerful tool.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.330
Monetary policy.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.010
Monetary policy is basically the
action plan of a central bank like

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.420
the RBI, to control the supply of
money and credit in the economy.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.440
The aim is to hit big targets
like controlling inflation

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.270
and boosting economic growth.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.220
What are the main weapons in its arsenal?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.080
First is the repo rate.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.390
This is the rate at which commercial banks
borrow money from the RBI for a short

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.800
term by selling government securities
with a promise to buy them back.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.810
If RBI increases the repo rate,
borrowing becomes expensive for banks,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.030
which means less money in the system.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.310
Next is the reverse repo rate.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.810
This is the opposite.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.800
It's the rate at which RBI
borrows from commercial banks.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.789
When banks have extra cash, they pocket
it with the RBI and increase here

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.530
encourages banks to deposit more with
RBI, again, reducing money supply.

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.205
Then we have the cash
reserve ratio or CRR.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.630
This is a certain percentage of
a bank's total deposits that it

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.150
must keep with the RBI AS cash.

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.010
The bank cannot use this money
for lending a higher CRR means

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.929
less money for banks to lend out.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.460
Similar to this is the statutory
liquidity ratio or SLR.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.140
This is the percentage of deposits
that banks must maintain in the form

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.060
of liquid assets like cash, gold, or
approved securities with themselves.

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.349
A higher SLR also reduces
a bank's lending capacity.

00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:04.424
There's also the marginal
standing facility or MSF.

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:10.005
This is an emergency window for banks
to borrow overnight from the RBI if they

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:12.315
are facing an unexpected cash crunch.

00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:13.575
It's a safety net.

00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:19.335
Finally, the bank rate, this is the rate
at which RBI lends to commercial banks

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:24.075
for the long term without any collateral,
it often acts as a penalty rate.

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:26.580
Financial inclusion.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.450
This term sounds fancy,
but the idea is simple.

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:35.460
Financial inclusion means making sure
that affordable financial products

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.929
and services are available to every
single person and business, no

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:41.789
matter how rich or poor they are.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.020
This includes basic things like a
savings account, access to credit

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.450
insurance, and a ways to send money.

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.735
KYC, know your customer.

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:54.495
KYC means know your customer.

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:58.965
It's a mandatory process where
banks verify who you are, why

00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:03.015
to prevent bad stuff like money
laundering and terrorist financing.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:08.115
The key parts of KYC are the customer
identification program, which is

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:12.165
collecting and verifying your basic
details like name and address.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.550
Then there's customer due diligence
where the bank understands your business

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.650
and transactions to check for risks.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.000
And finally, ongoing monitoring
where the bank keeps an eye on your

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.520
transactions for any suspicious activity.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.640
It's the bank's way of
being a good watchman.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.039
Digital banking slash payment systems.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.620
Digital banking is simply taking all
the bank services online from opening

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.390
an account to transferring funds.

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.240
Everything is now on
your phone or computer.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.659
Some important digital
payment systems in India are.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.150
NEFT or National
Electronic Funds transfer.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.500
This system processes transactions
in batches, so there's a slide

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.530
delay, but it's available 24 7
RTGS or real time gross settlement.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.510
This is for the big boys.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.260
It settles large value transactions
instantly, one by one without

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.120
clubbing them together.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.920
It's also available 24 7.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.880
IMPS or Immediate Payment
Service, the name says it all.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.550
It's an instant fund transfer service
available 24 7 even on holidays, right

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:25.280
from your mobile and the Superstar
UPI or Unified Payments Interface.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.210
This system links multiple bank
accounts to a single mobile app.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.910
It makes instant payments super easy
using a virtual payment address or VPA.

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:37.224
Real world relevance.

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:40.434
Now, why should an officer
care about all this?

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:44.905
Understanding different bank types
helps you guide diverse customers

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.125
from a farmer to a city businessman.

00:08:47.574 --> 00:08:51.834
Knowing RBI's functions helps you
understand the rules you have to follow.

00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:56.844
Grasping monetary policy lets you
explain to customers why their loan,

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:01.630
EMI just changed promoting financial
inclusion is a key part of the job.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.110
You must enforce KYC rules
strictly to protect the bank.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.800
And being a pro at Digital
payments helps you guide

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.330
customers in this new digital age.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.990
Breakdown of question types based on
past patterns For the exam, about 30%

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.000
of questions are direct definitions.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.520
Around 25% will ask about the
functions of an institution like RBI.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.390
You can expect about.

00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:34.425
20% of questions to be scenario based
asking you to apply a concept about 15%

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:41.505
will be full form questions for acronyms
like NEFD or KYC and maybe 10% will

00:09:41.535 --> 00:09:46.245
indirectly test your understanding of how
a change in a rate affects the economy.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.900
Formulas and tricks.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.270
While there are no math formulas, here
are some quick facts for RBI instruments.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.650
Repo rate is when banks borrow
from RBI reverse Repo is

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.630
when RBI borrows from banks.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.990
CRR is cash kept with R-B-I-S-L-R is
liquid assets the bank keeps with itself.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.459
And MSF is the emergency overnight
borrowing window for digital payments.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.530
NEFT is batch processing.

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.619
RTGS is real time for large values.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.500
IMPS is instant and mobile based.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.739
And UPI is instant using A VPA.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:28.119
The pillars of KYC are customer
identification, customer due

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.979
diligence, and ongoing monitoring.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.830
Methods of solving to solve
questions effectively.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.920
First, understand the core
definition of the concept.

00:10:38.189 --> 00:10:42.420
Look for keywords in the question,
relate the concept to its purpose.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.680
For example, why does CRR
exist to control liquidity?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.580
If you are stuck, use the
elimination strategy to remove wrong

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.740
options for scenario questions.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.880
Understand the context and
always practice your acronyms.

00:10:57.104 --> 00:11:01.574
Lastly for policy questions, understand
the cause and effect, like how a

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:03.370
repo rate hike impacts lending.

00:11:04.724 --> 00:11:06.675
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:11:06.885 --> 00:11:09.255
Here are some mnemonics for repo.

00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:14.204
Think repurchase banks repurchase
their securities for reverse repo.

00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:21.464
It's the reverse action for CRR think cash
reserve with RBI and for SLR statutory

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:23.685
liquidity kept by the bank itself.

00:11:24.015 --> 00:11:26.535
Always ask why a concept exists.

00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:29.865
It helps you remember group
similar concepts together

00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:31.035
to see their differences.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.130
And be very careful with negative
questions that ask, which is not.

00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:39.405
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:43.155
A classic mistake is confusing
repo and reverse repo.

00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:46.035
Remember, repo is for banks to get money.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.435
Reverse repo is for them to park money.

00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:50.205
Also don't mix up.

00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:54.795
CRR and S-L-R-C-R-R is
cash with R-B-I-S-L-R is

00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:56.265
liquid assets with the bank.

00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:00.285
A huge misconception is that
payments banks can give loans.

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:04.655
They absolutely cannot, and don't
think all banks are the same.

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.065
They have different roles.

00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:10.895
Finally, banking policies change,
so always stay updated with RBI's.

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:12.155
Latest announcements.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.850
WH framework summary.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.880
So to sum it up, what
is the banking system?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.260
It's a network of institutions
managing money regulated by policies

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.480
like KYC and monetary policy.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.800
Why does it exist to drive the
economy by managing, savings,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.960
credit, and transactions securely.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.190
When is it used?

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.780
Constantly Every day.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.680
By everyone.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.580
Where is it?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.420
Everywhere.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.560
From rural villages to urban centers,
both physically and digitally.

00:12:40.814 --> 00:12:41.655
Who uses it?

00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:44.985
All of us individuals,
businesses, and governments

00:12:45.045 --> 00:12:47.265
with RBI as the main regulator.

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:49.005
And how does it work?

00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:54.705
Through loans, deposits, KYC policy tools
like the repo rate and digital systems

00:12:54.705 --> 00:12:57.225
that provide instant access to services.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:13:00.285
Now, let's test our knowledge
with a few examples.

00:13:01.755 --> 00:13:03.405
Fully worked out examples.

00:13:03.765 --> 00:13:07.455
Example, one monetary
policy instrument question.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:11.475
Which of the following is the rate at
which commercial banks borrow money

00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:16.005
from the Reserve Bank of India RBI for
a short period by selling government

00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:20.535
securities with an agreement to
repurchase them a reverse re report

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:26.565
rate B, cash reserve ratio C report
eight D, statutory liquidity ratio.

00:13:26.824 --> 00:13:29.615
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:30.995
Let's break it down.

00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:34.745
The question is about the rate for
short-term borrowing by banks from

00:13:34.745 --> 00:13:37.295
the RBI against securities option.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:41.795
A reverse report rate is when RBI
borrows from banks, so that's out.

00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:45.995
Option BCRR is a reserve
requirement, not a borrowing rate.

00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:49.444
Option DSLR is also a reserve requirement.

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:54.900
This leaves us with c. Repo rate repo
literally stands for repurchase option,

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.670
which perfectly matches the question's
description, correct answer, C repo rate.

00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:03.675
Example, two types of banks question.

00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:07.725
Which type of bank in India is
specifically established to provide

00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:09.765
credit and other banking facilities?

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:13.845
Primarily to small and marginal
farmers, agricultural laborers,

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:18.885
and artisans in rural areas, A
commercial bank, B, payments bank.

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.895
C, small finance bank.

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:22.725
D, regional rural bank.

00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:24.425
Understand the question before.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:26.345
Moving to explanation here.

00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:30.965
The keywords are rural areas, small
and marginal, farmers and artisans.

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:35.255
Commercial banks serve everyone, so
they are not this specific payments.

00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:37.265
Banks don't primarily give credit.

00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:42.395
Small finance banks serve the underserved,
but the description is the exact original

00:14:42.395 --> 00:14:44.375
mandate of a regional rural bank.

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:48.215
RBS were created precisely
for this purpose to serve the

00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:50.015
weaker sections in rural India.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.030
Correct answer.

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:53.461
D. Regional rural bank, RRB.

00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:59.625
Example, three digital payment systems
question, which digital payment system

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:04.005
in India allows for real time gross
settlement of high value interbank

00:15:04.005 --> 00:15:12.315
fund transfers operating 24 7
A-N-E-F-D-B-I-M-P-S-C-U-P-I-D-R-T-G-S.

00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:16.805
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, let's look at the clues.

00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:22.805
Realtime gross settlement and high value
NEFT works in batches, not realtime.

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:27.245
IMPS and UPI are instant, but are
not defined by gross settlement

00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:31.925
in this specific way, the system
designed explicitly for realtime gross

00:15:31.925 --> 00:15:34.415
settlement of large amounts is RTGS.

00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:38.405
The name itself gives it away,
correct answer, D-R-T-G-S.

00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:39.395
Thank you.

00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:40.895
See you in the next lecture.
