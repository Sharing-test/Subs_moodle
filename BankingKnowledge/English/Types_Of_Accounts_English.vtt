00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on types of accounts.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:12.570
Let's decode this concept like detectives
concept explanation In the fabulous world

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
of banking, types of accounts simply
refers to the different kinds of financial

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.250
accounts that you, me, and businesses
can open with a bank to handle our money.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.530
It's not as complicated as it sounds.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.010
Each account type is built for a specific
job offering different features like

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.330
how much interest you can earn, how
easily you can get your money, and how

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.310
many times you can swipe that card.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.390
Understanding these is the very
first step to managing your

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.310
finances and is absolutely crucial
for banking professionals as it

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.120
helps them advise customers and
process everything correctly.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.480
The main types you'll
see everywhere include.

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.475
First, the savings account.

00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.305
This is the most common one, designed
for individuals to park their money,

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.185
save up and earn a tiny bit of interest.

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:08.175
It's all about encouraging good
saving habits while letting you

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:10.125
access funds for your daily needs.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:12.435
Next is the current account.

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:17.145
This one is the playground for
businesses, firms, and public enterprises.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.750
It's built to handle frequent
and very large transactions.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.250
Unlike its cousin, the savings
account, it usually offers zero

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
interest and might even charge you
some fees, but in return you get

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
unlimited transactions and that magical
thing called an overdraft facility.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
Then we have the fixed deposit or FD
account, also called a term deposit.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
An FD account lets you deposit
a lump sum of money for a fixed

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
period, which could be anything
from a few months to several years.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.660
For this loyalty, the bank gives
you a much higher rate of interest

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.430
compared to a savings account.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.920
Just remember, you can't just break up
with your FD and take the money out before

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.260
it matures without facing a penalty.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.710
And there's the recurring
deposit or RD account.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.680
An RD account is for discipline savers.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.239
It encourages regular savings by
letting you deposit a fixed amount

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.730
every single month for a preset period.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.950
It's a nice mix combining the benefits
of a savings account and a fixed deposit,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.135
offering better interest rates than
savings while building that saving muscle.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.970
There is also a loan account.

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.260
While it's not where you deposit
money, a loan account is created.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.399
When a bank lends you money, it keeps
a record of the principal amount.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.910
You borrowed the interest piling
up your repayment schedule

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.709
and the outstanding balance.

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:45.915
Finally the Dmat account.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:51.585
A Dmat or Dematerialized account is what
you use to hold shares and securities

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.835
in an electronic or digital form.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:58.365
It is absolutely essential if you
want to trade in the stock market

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:03.225
because it gets rid of the old school
hassle of physical share certificates.

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.415
Real world relevance.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:10.245
So why does this matter in the
real world for customer service?

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:13.785
Understanding these account
types helps bank officers guide

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:17.084
customers to the perfect financial
products for their needs.

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:18.945
For transaction processing.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:23.295
This knowledge ensures they handle
all your deposits, withdrawals, and

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:26.205
transfers accurately in risk management.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:29.265
Knowing the difference between
accounts helps in assessing

00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:33.020
financial risks and making sure
all regulatory rules are followed.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.060
It even drives product development
as insights into what customers

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.140
need lead to new banking services.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.510
Bank employees can also act as a
financial advisory service, helping

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.440
clients with investment and saving
strategies based on these account

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.870
options and for fraud prevention.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.520
Being aware of how each account works
helps in spotting and stopping any

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.830
funny business or fraudulent activities.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.530
Breakdown of question types.

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:05.295
Based on what we've seen
in past exam patterns.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:09.345
Questions on this topic, mostly
check if you understand the features,

00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:11.774
differences, and users of these accounts.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:16.485
About 40% are feature-based
questions, asking about a specific

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:20.534
characteristic, like which account
gives you an overdraft facility.

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:25.275
Around 25% are difference based
questions, which will ask you to

00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:29.145
compare to accounts, for instance,
what is the main difference between a

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.185
savings account and a current account?

00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:34.724
Another 20% are
application-based questions.

00:04:35.055 --> 00:04:38.474
These are scenario questions where
you have to pick the best account

00:04:38.474 --> 00:04:43.305
for a situation like a small business
owner needs to make frequent payments,

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:44.775
which account should they get?

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:49.815
10% are related to interest or
maturity, focusing on interest rates

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:52.275
or tenure details of FDS and rds.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:55.635
And the final 5% are
terminology questions.

00:04:55.784 --> 00:05:00.440
Just testing if you know specific terms,
like what does dematerialized mean?

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:05.625
Formulas and tricks now
for some handy formulas and

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.155
tricks to keep up your sleeve.

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:12.854
For interest calculation, especially
simple interest for savings or rds, you

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:18.794
can use the classic formula I equals P
times R times T divided by a hundred.

00:05:19.275 --> 00:05:24.675
The FD maturity value is simply the
principle plus the compound interest, and

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:30.044
the RD maturity value is the sum of all
your monthly deposits plus the interest.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.100
Here are some quick tricks to
identify a current account.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.840
Look for keywords like business
unlimited transactions, no interest

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.450
or overdraft for a savings account.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.490
Look for individual small interest,
limited transactions, and personal use.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.980
The key word for a fixed deposit is
lump sum, fixed period, higher interest

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.720
and penalty for early withdrawal, and
for a recurring deposit, just spot

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.980
the phrases, monthly installments,
fixed period, or discipline savings.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.210
Methods of solving.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.820
So how do we solve questions on this?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.770
First is the direct recall method
for feature or terminology questions.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.270
You just recall the definition, read
the question, access your memory,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.740
and pick the matching option.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.640
Then there's the comparison method
for difference based questions.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.430
Just make a quick chart comparing the two
accounts on interest, transaction limits,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.455
and target user to find the contrast.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:32.825
For application questions, use
the scenario analysis method.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:37.475
Figure out what the user in the
story needs, savings, spending, or

00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:41.075
high returns, and match it to the
account with the right features.

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:44.885
Finally, the keyword spotting
method is great for speed.

00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:51.125
Scan the question for words like business,
salary, lump sum, monthly or shares, and

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.075
link them to their respective accounts.

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:57.765
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to work smarter, not harder.

00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:02.355
Use feature association instead
of memorizing long definitions.

00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:05.685
Just link each account with
two or three unique features.

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:10.215
For example, savings equals
interest plus limited transactions.

00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:12.345
Use the elimination strategy.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.125
If you're not sure, get rid of the
options that are clearly wrong.

00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:19.095
This seriously boosts your
chances of getting it right.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.050
Also try purpose-driven categorization.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.630
Think about the main job of each account.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.570
Is it for savings, spending, or investing?

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.820
This helps you sort them out quickly.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.860
You can even create mnemonics,
something like SCF for savings,

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.955
current FD to remember the general
order of liquidity and interest.

00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.995
And always focus on exceptions.

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:45.385
Note the unique things like
a current account, having an

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:47.965
overdraft, but no interest questions.

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:49.855
Love to target these special points.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.650
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.560
All right, let's talk
about the common craps.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.640
A very common mistake is confusing
savings and current accounts.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.690
Remember, savings are for
individuals to save with limits.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.800
Current accounts are for businesses
with high volumes and no interest.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.930
Many people also overlook the
penalties for early FD withdrawal.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.270
Breaking an FD early costs you.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.250
Another misconception is assuming all
accounts earn interest, they don't.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.140
Current accounts typically don't.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.860
Also don't misunderstand the
purpose of a Dmat account.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.710
It's for holding
securities, not for money.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.270
Transactions like a savings account,
and never ignore KYC requirements.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.090
All accounts need customer
know your documents.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.679
Lastly, don't think an
RD is the same as an fd.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.270
An RD involves regular monthly
deposits, whereas an FD needs one

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.540
single lump sum W framework summary.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:49.709
To put it all together
using our WH framework.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.449
What is this topic about the different
types of bank accounts for managing money?

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.949
Why do they exist to serve diverse
financial needs, like savings,

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:00.870
spending, investing, and borrowing?

00:09:00.989 --> 00:09:01.290
When are they used?

00:09:02.564 --> 00:09:07.064
Whenever an individual or business needs
to deposit, withdraw, or manage their

00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:09.135
funds safely, where are they found?

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:13.035
They are offered by all commercial
banks, cooperative banks and

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:15.645
financial institutions who uses them?

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:20.235
Individuals, businesses, institutions,
and even government bodies.

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:21.584
And how do they work?

00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:26.685
By taking deposits, earning interest
on some facilitating transactions, and

00:09:26.685 --> 00:09:28.785
providing various financial services.

00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:30.944
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:31.244 --> 00:09:33.165
Example, one question.

00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:37.875
Which type of bank account is primarily
designed for businesses and offers

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:42.704
unlimited transactions, but typically does
not pay interest on the deposited amount?

00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:44.444
A savings account.

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:46.364
B. Fixed deposit account.

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:49.994
C. Current account D,
recurring deposit account.

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:52.729
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.940
All right, let's solve this.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.140
The key phrases are for
businesses, unlimited transactions,

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.670
and does not pay interest.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.300
Option a savings account
is for individuals and pays

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.590
interest, so that's out.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.300
Option B, fixed deposit is for lump
sum savings to earn high interest

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.220
not transactions, so that's wrong.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.440
Option D recurring deposit is for monthly
savings, not business transactions.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.640
Option C. Current account is specifically
for businesses, allows unlimited

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.860
transactions and doesn't pay interest.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.270
It's a perfect match.

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:30.255
Correct answer, C. Example two question.

00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:34.515
An individual wishes to save a fixed
amount of money every month for a

00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:38.385
period of two years to accumulate
funds for a future expense and

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:41.595
wants to earn a higher interest
rate than a regular savings account.

00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:44.655
Which type of account would
be most suitable for them?

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:46.245
A DMA account.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:47.985
B Fixed deposit account.

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:50.265
C, recurring deposit account.

00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:51.795
D, current account.

00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:54.615
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.415
Let's analyze this scenario.

00:10:56.715 --> 00:11:00.255
The person wants to save a
fixed amount every month for two

00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:02.265
years and earn higher interest.

00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:05.955
Option A Dmat account is for
shares, so that's not it.

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:10.875
Option B, fixed deposit is for a single
lump sum deposit, not monthly ones.

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:15.375
Option D. Current account is for
businesses and has no interest.

00:11:15.735 --> 00:11:19.995
Option C recurring deposit account
is designed precisely for fixed

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:24.315
monthly deposits over a set period and
offers higher interest than savings.

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:26.175
This fits the individual's needs.

00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:30.640
Perfectly correct answer
C. Example three question.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.410
Which of the following statements is true
regarding a fixed deposit FD account?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.980
A. It allows unlimited
withdrawals without penalty.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.420
B. It is primarily used for day-to-day
transactions by individuals.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.380
C, it offers a higher interest
rate compared to a savings account

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.910
for a fixed tenure D, it requires
monthly deposits of a fixed amount.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.760
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.390
Okay.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.420
We need to find the one
true statement about an fd.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.920
Let's check the options.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.630
Option A is false.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.940
FDS have penalties for early withdrawal.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.010
Option B is also false.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.530
Savings accounts are for
day-to-day transactions.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.550
Option D is also false that
describes a recurring deposit,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.860
and FD is a lump sum deposit.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.240
This leaves option C. It offers a
higher interest rate compared to a

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.800
savings account for a fixed tenure.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.840
This is the defining feature of a fixed
deposit, so this statement is absolutely

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.720
true, correct answer, C. Thank you.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.130
See you in the next lecture.
