00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on small finance banks, sbs.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.710
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.275
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:19.695
All right, so what exactly are these
small finance banks or sbs, the Reserve

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:25.605
Bank of India or RBI introduced this new
type of bank with one primary mission?

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:27.134
Financial inclusion.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.775
Think of them as specialized banks.

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:34.185
The kirana stores of the banking
world designed to serve people that

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:36.525
traditional big banks sometimes miss.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.440
We are talking about small business units,
tiny industries, folks in the unorganized

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.470
sector and our small and marginal farmers.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.450
Their main job is providing basic
banking services, accepting your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.520
deposits and lending you money.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.660
They are laser focused on giving
credit and other financial.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.339
Services to these specific
groups, helping them grow and

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.410
join the formal financial system.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.700
Now, while they act like full fledged
commercial banks, in many ways,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.830
they do have certain restrictions.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.210
This ensures they stick to their
main goal of financial inclusion.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.205
And yes, they are regulated
by the big boss, the RBI.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.000
Just like any other bank, real
world relevance, these sbs play a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.830
massive role in spreading financial
services to underserved areas, which

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.720
directly boosts the economic growth
of local communities for your exam.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.150
Understanding SBS is crucial.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.170
It gives you great market
understanding, helping you analyze

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.970
the ever-changing banking scene.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.795
It also provides deep insight
into financial inclusion and how

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:50.055
different banking models help bring
more people into the formal system.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:55.665
You'll get a better grip on the overall
regulatory landscape, and it offers a

00:01:55.665 --> 00:02:00.375
fresh perspective on credit assessment,
especially for priority sectors.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.440
Finally, it helps in identifying the
needs of specific customer segments

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.580
and highlights the role of banks
in fostering grassroots economic

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.520
development, breakdown of question types.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.610
Now based on patterns in your exam.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.270
Questions on SBS usually
come in a few flavors.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.340
About 30% of the time you'll get a
definition of purpose-based question

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.290
asking about their core function.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.230
Around 25% of questions are about
regulatory or eligibility criteria like

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.570
minimum capital or who can promote them.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
Then 20% of questions will test your
knowledge on permitted activities and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.400
restrictions what they can and cannot do.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.320
Another 15% might be comparison
questions, asking how they

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.820
differ from payments banks.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.450
And the final 10% are often historical
or committee-based questions about who

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.360
recommended them formulas and tricks.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.050
While there are no complex
mathematical formulas here, there

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.650
are some magic numbers and facts
you absolutely must memorize.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.680
The minimum paid up
capital is now 200 crows.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.310
It was a hundred crows before,
so remember the new number.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.260
The promoter's minimum contribution
must be 40% for the first five years.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.020
The priority sector lending or
PSL target is a whopping 75% of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.430
their adjusted net bank credit.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.465
Regarding loan sizes,
there are restrictions.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:32.315
A maximum of 10% of their total
loan portfolio can go to a single

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:34.865
borrower and 15% to a single group.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:39.335
Remember, existing non-banking
financial companies, microfinance

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:43.325
institutions, and local area banks
are eligible to convert into sbs.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.440
And the name to remember is the NTA
Moore Committee, which recommended

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.990
decor creation methods of solving.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.860
Tackling.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.460
Questions about SBS is more
about a conceptual approach.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.490
First, always identify the core mandate.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.720
The primary purpose is financial
inclusion for underserved groups.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.765
This single point can help you
eliminate wrong answers immediately.

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:11.820
Next, categorize information as you
study what they are, what they do.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.019
What they can't do, and key
numbers for comparison questions.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.980
Just create a quick mental table
comparing SBS with payments.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.400
Banks.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.920
Also focus on the restrictions.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.200
These are classic, tricky question areas.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.240
Always understand the why.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:31.795
Knowing why they were introduced helps
answer any purpose-based question.

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:37.075
Finally, link to committees
just associate NA Moore with SBS

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:39.625
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.175
Here are some quick brain hacks.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:47.065
Just think small equals niche
banking for financial inclusion.

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:51.205
The 75% PSL rule is a key differentiator.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.645
So lock that number in your head.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:58.505
For capital, remember, 200
crows for restrictions.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:03.335
A simple trick is no big corp,
no subs, and for the origin

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:05.375
story, it's a direct connection.

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:09.485
NCI tmore equals SFB Origin simple.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.230
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.900
Please avoid these common traps.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.270
A huge mistake is confusing.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.740
SBS with payments.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.250
Banks.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.710
Remember, SBS can lend money, but
payments banks absolutely cannot.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.299
Another error is assuming they
have full commercial bank powers.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.200
They don't.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.340
They have specific restrictions,
especially on lending to large

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.950
corporations and setting up subsidiaries.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.109
Also, don't mix up the initial capital
of a hundred growers with the current

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:49.710
requirement of 200 growers, and please
don't forget that high 75% PSL target.

00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:52.784
WH framework summary.

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:57.284
So to quickly summarize, what
are they niche banks for?

00:05:57.284 --> 00:05:58.544
Underserved sections.

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:03.525
Why do they exist to promote financial
inclusion and provide credit?

00:06:03.914 --> 00:06:05.234
When were they introduced?

00:06:05.534 --> 00:06:08.984
Based on the Nagate Moore
committees recommendations with

00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:11.534
licenses granted from 2015.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.090
Where do they operate?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.440
Across India?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.270
Focusing on local needs.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.620
Who do they serve?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.490
Small businesses, micro
industries, and small farmers.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.020
And how do they do it?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.030
By accepting deposits and extending
credit under strict RBI guidelines.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.200
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.180
Let's try a few questions.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.580
Example one question.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.390
Which of the following committees
recommended the establishment

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.490
of small finance banks in India?

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.960
A. Rag Raja committee B, ham
Committee, C, nmo, committee D,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.640
or Patel Committee understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.849
The question is a direct factual
recall about the committee behind sbs.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.469
As we discussed, the nacha More
Committee on Comprehensive Financial

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:09.325
Services was instrumental in this,
so the answer is clearly option C.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.690
Example two question.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.370
What is the minimum paid up capital
requirement for a small finance bank

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.680
in India as per current regulations?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.570
A 50 crows.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.230
B hundred Crows C, 200 crows.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.150
D 500 crows.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.925
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.039
This question tests your knowledge
of the current capital rules.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.680
Remember the common
mistake we talked about?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.300
The initial requirement was a hundred
crows, but it was later increased.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.530
The current updated minimum
paid up capital is 200 crows.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.140
Therefore, option C is the correct one.

00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:52.245
Example three question.

00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:56.145
Which of the following activities
is generally not permitted

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:57.674
for small finance banks?

00:07:58.094 --> 00:07:59.865
A. Accepting deposits.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.385
B. Lending to micro industries.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:04.575
C. Setting up subsidiaries.

00:08:04.724 --> 00:08:07.305
D. Distributing mutual fund products.

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:10.365
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:14.565
Here we need to identify
the restricted activity.

00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:19.305
We know SBS can accept deposits
lend to their target audience, like

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:24.164
micro industries and even distribute
financial products, but a major

00:08:24.164 --> 00:08:28.335
restriction is that they are generally
not allowed to set up subsidiaries

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:30.585
to maintain focus on core banking.

00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:32.684
So the correct answer is see.

00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:33.824
Thank you.

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:35.355
See you in the next lecture.
