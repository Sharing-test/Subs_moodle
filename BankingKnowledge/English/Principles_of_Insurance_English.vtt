00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on principles of Insurance.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.290
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.410
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.775
So what is this magic called insurance?

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:22.395
At its heart insurance is a
contract, a simple promise

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.545
represented by a policy in this deal.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.655
An individual or a business gets
financial protection against

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.785
losses from an insurance company.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.815
How does the company do
it without going broke?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.830
Simple.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.360
They pool all their clients' risks
together to make the payments more

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.700
affordable for everyone who is insured.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.460
The entire system is built on a set
of fundamental principles that ensure

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.260
everything is fair and legal for
both the insurer and the insured.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.180
These principles are the absolute
backbone of the insurance industry

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.270
determining if a contract is even valid.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:04.005
Real world relevance.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:09.075
Understanding these principles is not
just for passing exams, my friend.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:14.745
It helps you assess risk, advise
customers on the right products and handle

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.905
claims without pulling your hair out.

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:21.135
It's all about ensuring compliance
and building that all important

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:25.545
trust, which is the lifeblood
of effective banking operations.

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:27.494
Topics.

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:32.054
Now let's meet the big players,
the six core principles.

00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:37.095
First is the principle of utmost
good faith or bury my fade.

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:42.494
I, which just means both parties must
be completely honest and disclose

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:45.255
all important facts, no secrets.

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:50.235
Next, the principle of insurable
interest, which says you must

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.895
have a genuine financial stake
in whatever you are insuring.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.180
You can't insure your neighbor's
new car just because you like it.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.120
Then comes the principle of indemnity.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.610
This ensures you are only compensated
for your actual loss, not a pesa.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.660
More insurance is a safety
net, not a lottery ticket.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.610
After that is the principle of
subrogation, where after paying

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.810
you, the insurer gets to chase the
third party who caused the loss.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.610
They step into your shoes.

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:24.865
We also have the
principle of contribution.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:30.085
If you have multiple insurance policies
for the same thing, all the insurers

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.065
will share the loss proportionately.

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:38.035
Finally, the principle of proximate
cause or cause proxima, this means

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.355
the loss must be directly caused
by the danger you insured against,

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:44.905
not some distant, unrelated event.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.500
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns in your

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000
exam for banking knowledge.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.060
Questions on these principles
come in a few flavors.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.610
About 40% of the time you'll get direct
definition or concept based questions.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.990
For example, which principle states
that the insured should not make a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.970
profit from the insurance contract.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.959
Another 35% ask scenario based
application questions where they

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.250
give you a little story and ask which
principle applies or was broken.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.769
Then about 15% ask simple, true
false statements like the principle

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.820
of subrogation allows the insured
to claim compensation from both

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.405
the insurer and the third party.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.679
Spoiler alert, that's false.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.019
And finally, a small 10% are matching
questions where you match principles

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.725
to their definitions or examples.

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:38.385
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:42.255
Now, these aren't complex
mathematical formulas, so relax.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.985
They are just key concepts
to lock in your brain.

00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:50.505
For utmost good faith, full disclosure
is a must for insurable interest.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:55.335
No financial stake, no policy
for indemnity, no profit.

00:03:55.455 --> 00:03:57.585
Just compensation for actual loss.

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:03.045
For subrogation, the insurer steps
in after a payout for contribution.

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:05.715
Multiple policies result in a shared loss.

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.435
And for proximate cause.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:10.255
The direct cause of
the loss truly matters.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:12.204
Methods of solving.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.924
When you face a question on these
principles, the method is to

00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:17.844
carefully analyze the situation.

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:21.175
First, identify the key
parties and actions.

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:25.225
Figure out who is involved, the
insured, the insurer, a third

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:26.725
party, and what they are doing.

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:30.355
Second, recall the core
definitions of each principle.

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:32.905
Then match the scenario to the principle.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.159
If someone is hiding information,
think at most good faith if the

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.030
person has no financial connection,
it's about insurable interest.

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.960
If the claim is bigger than the
actual loss, it's about indemnity.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.890
If the insurer is going after
someone else, it's sub obligation.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.210
If there are multiple policies, it's
contribution and if there is a chain

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.219
of events, it's proximate cause.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.599
Finally, determine if the principle
is being applied or violated.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.940
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.500
Let's talk about some smart techniques.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.310
Use keyword association to
create mental shortcuts.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.170
When you see words like honesty or
disclosure, your brain should scream

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.840
utmost good faith for financial loss
or benefit, think insurable interest.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:23.845
If you see actual loss or no
profit, it's definitely indemnity.

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:27.985
Third party or recovery points
straight to subrogation.

00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:35.005
Multiple policies or share is the clue for
contribution and direct cause or unbroken

00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.615
chain is your sign for proximate cause.

00:05:38.155 --> 00:05:42.265
Also use the elimination strategy
for multiple choice questions.

00:05:42.715 --> 00:05:45.235
Get rid of the options
that are obviously wrong.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.935
And always focus on the why.

00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:51.535
Understanding the reason behind each
principle makes them so much easier.

00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:55.365
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:57.795
Now let's look at the common traps.

00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:01.815
A huge mistake is confusing
indemnity with profit.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.645
Remember, insurance is only to
cover the actual financial damage.

00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:09.945
Another one is ignoring material facts.

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:15.255
Some people think only big details
matter for utmost good faith wrong.

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:19.545
Any fact that could influence the
insurer's decision is material.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.120
Also don't misunderstand
insurable interest by thinking

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.740
it's only about ownership.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.960
It's about any financial stake like
a creditor has in a debtor's life.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.230
Don't miss up Subrogation
and contribution.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.540
Subrogation is the insurer recovering
from a third party while contribution

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.000
is multiple insurers sharing one loss.

00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:47.365
And please don't overlook proximate
cause by focusing on distant causes

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.775
instead of the most direct one.

00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:51.765
WH framework summary.

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:57.555
So to wrap it all up, what they are, the
fundamental rules that govern insurance

00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:00.284
contracts to ensure fairness and legality.

00:07:00.645 --> 00:07:05.895
Why To prevent fraud, unjust enrichment,
and maintain the system's integrity.

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:07.365
When are they applied?

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:13.125
When forming a contract during its term,
and especially when settling claims, where

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.735
are they used in all types of insurance?

00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:16.784
All over the world.

00:07:17.109 --> 00:07:22.330
Who is involved Insurers, the insured
and the legal systems that enforce

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.580
these contracts and how do they work?

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.140
By guiding disclosures, determining
contract validity, managing

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.549
claims, and resolving disputes
fully worked out examples.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.739
Let's tackle some examples.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.445
Example, one question Mr. Sharma had.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.270
Two fire insurance policies for his
house, one for rupees, five lacks

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.910
from company A and another for rupees.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.530
10 lacks from company B.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.700
His house suffered a fire
loss of six lacks according to

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.260
the principles of insurance.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.410
How will the loss be settled
between the two companies?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.120
A company A will pay five lacks
and company B will pay one.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.260
Lack B, company B will
pay the entire six lacks.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.849
C, both companies will pay three.

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.979
Lacks each D The loss will be shared
proportionally based on the sum insured.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.135
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.655
All right, let's break it down.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:23.895
Mr. Sharma has two policies
for the same house.

00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:27.974
This is a classic case where the
principle of contribution applies.

00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:32.534
This principle ensures that insurers
share the load proportionally,

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:34.485
and the insured doesn't profit.

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:39.765
The total sum insured is five Lacks
plus 10 Laxs, which is 15 Lacks.

00:08:40.094 --> 00:08:42.944
The actual loss is six Lacks company.

00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:48.375
A share is calculated as it's sum
insured upon total sum insured

00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:50.175
multiplied by actual loss.

00:08:50.444 --> 00:08:55.935
So five lacks upon 15 lacks multiplied
by six lacks, which is one third

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.094
of six lacks equals two lacks.

00:08:58.515 --> 00:08:59.655
Company B share is.

00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:04.955
It's sum insured upon total sum
insured multiplied by actual loss.

00:09:05.195 --> 00:09:10.535
So 10 lacks upon 15 lacks multiplied
by six lacks, which is two thirds

00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:12.695
of six lacks equals four lacks.

00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:16.745
Therefore, the loss is shared
proportionally, correct answer

00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:19.995
D. Example two question.

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:25.065
Ms. Puja purchased a life insurance
policy for her brother who is financially

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:29.625
dependent on her, which fundamental
principle of insurance is primarily

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.485
demonstrated in this situation.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.035
A principle of subrogation.

00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:36.825
B. Principle of utmost good faith.

00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:39.675
C. Principle of insurable interest.

00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:42.105
D Principle of proximate cause.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:47.094
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, let's analyze this.

00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:50.844
Ms. Puja is insuring her
brother's life because he is

00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:52.525
financially dependent on her.

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:56.305
This means she would suffer
a direct financial loss if

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:57.834
something were to happen to him.

00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:01.344
This scenario screams principle
of insurable interest.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.180
This principle demands that the
policy holder must have a financial

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.550
stake in the subject matter here.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.840
Ms. Puja has a clear financial interest
in her brother's continued life.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.700
The other options don't fit.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.800
Subrogation is about third party recovery
at most good faith is about disclosure.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.550
Proximate cause is about the
cause of loss, correct answer

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.310
C Example, three question.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.580
A policy holder's car was
damaged in an accident.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.730
The actual repair cost was 50,000 rupees.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:38.460
However, the policy holder tried to claim
70,000 rupees from the insurer arguing

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.530
for inconvenience and loss of use.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.520
Which insurance principle would
the insurer invoke to settle the

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.439
claim for 50,000 rupees only.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.920
A principle of subrogation.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.170
B, principle of indemnity.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.540
C. Principle of contribution.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.120
D. Principle of utmost good faith.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.300
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.530
In this situation, the actual
loss is 50,000 rupees, but

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.150
the claim is for 70,000.

00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:05.375
Rupe.

00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:09.724
Trying to claim more than the actual
loss would mean making a profit,

00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:12.094
which is a big no-no in insurance.

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:16.055
The principle that prevents this
is the principle of indemnity.

00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:20.375
It skates that insurance is only
for compensation of the actual

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:24.574
financial loss to put you back in the
same financial position as before.

00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:26.525
The loss not to make you richer.

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:31.594
