00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Microsoft Office.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.420
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.185
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.215
So what is this Microsoft Office?

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.595
You ask Array.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.265
It's just a fancy name for a toolkit.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:25.515
A suite of productivity applications
developed by the good people at Microsoft.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:29.805
It is used everywhere from
homes and schools to bigshot

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:32.055
businesses for all sorts of tasks.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:37.275
The main heroes of this suite are Word,
which is for all your text documents.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.250
Excel, the king of spreadsheets and data
analysis PowerPoint for making those

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.320
jaw dropping presentations and outlook,
which handles your professional life

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.450
with email and calendar management.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.940
Basically, these applications are
designed to help all of us create,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.020
manage, and present information
without losing our minds.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.400
Real world relevance and don't
think this is just for college

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.350
projects in the real world.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.740
Its relevance is massive
for data management.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
Our bank offices use Excel to
juggle customer data, transaction

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.620
records, and financial statements,
making sure everything is

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.660
accurate and easy to analyze.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:26.655
For report generation, word is
absolutely essential for drafting

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:31.845
official letters, reports, and those
very serious policy documents, keeping

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:34.275
communication clear and professional.

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:39.705
When it comes to presentations, PowerPoint
is the go-to tool for creating visual

00:01:39.705 --> 00:01:44.565
aids for meetings, training, or trying
to impress clients, which enhances

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:49.725
clarity and keeps people from falling
asleep, and of course, communication.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.650
Outlook helps with professional email
scheduling meetings and managing

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.320
contacts, which streamlines daily chaos.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.060
All this leads to better operational
efficiency as being good with

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.290
office tools helps automate boring
tasks, reducing manual effort.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.690
Lastly, for compliance and auditing,
these applications are a lifesaver

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.010
for organizing and presenting data
for compliance checks, ensuring

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.900
everyone follows the rules.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:24.135
Breakdown of question types now for
the part you've been waiting for

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:26.895
based on past patterns for your exam.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:31.665
Questions on Microsoft Office show
up in a few predictable formats.

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:37.665
A huge chunk about 30% of the questions
are all about keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:42.325
Yes, they love asking for those
key combinations, like control S

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:44.845
for save or control C for copy.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:49.465
Then about 25% of questions
will test your knowledge of

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:51.565
application features and functions.

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:56.095
Asking things like which tab has
the page layout option in word.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.140
Another 20% will be on file extensions
and types where you need to identify

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.989
the default file extension, like dot
doc X for word or do X ls for Excel.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.870
We also see about 15% of questions on
basic Excel formulas and functions.

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.079
Testing your understanding of simple but
crucial formulas like some average max

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.080
and min. And finally, a small 10% will
be about interface elements, asking you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.430
to identify parts of the screen, like
the ribbon or quick access toolbar.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:33.435
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:38.205
While the word formulas makes us
think only of Excel, let's talk

00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:42.555
about the key features, shortcuts,
and concepts you must memorize.

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:46.995
Think of these as your secret
weapons for common shortcuts.

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:49.220
You must know control S for save.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:54.495
Control C for copy control, X
for cut and control V for paste.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:59.625
Don't forget Ctrl Z to undo a
mistake and control Y to redo it.

00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:02.144
Control P is for print control.

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:05.505
F is to find something,
control ET is to replace it.

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:10.394
Control N is for a new file and
control O is to open an existing one.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.260
For my friends using Excel, the basic
formulas are a must always start with

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.170
an equal sign Use equal sum range
to add numbers, equal average range

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.510
for the average equal max range.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.640
To find the biggest number and equal
min range for the smallest, the equal

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.900
count range formula is handy for
counting cells that contain numbers.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.800
And please, please remember the file
extensions for Word it's DO Doc X. For

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:48.110
XL it's X Ls, and for PowerPoint it's pt.
The older versions used DOC XLS and DOT

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.610
access uses do acb and an Outlook data
file is a do PST file methods of solving.

00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:58.605
So how do you actually do these things?

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.224
It's simpler than you think.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:05.685
To save a document, you can click
the file tab, then save or save as.

00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:07.365
Choose where to save it.

00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:11.745
Give it a name and click save
To insert a table in word.

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:16.335
Just go to the insert tab, click
table, and either drag to select

00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:20.115
your rows and columns, or choose
insert table for more control.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.020
To create a chart in Excel, first,
select your data, then head to the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.585
insert tab and pick a chart type
you like from the charts group.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:31.815
Need a new slide in PowerPoint easy.

00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:37.784
Go to the home tab, click new slide in
the slides group and choose a layout to

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:40.155
change font size in any of these apps.

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:45.164
Select the text, go to the home tab
and use the font size dropdown menu

00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:47.594
or the increase and decrease buttons.

00:05:48.044 --> 00:05:51.284
And to send an email in
Outlook, click new email.

00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:53.895
Put the recipient's
address in the two field.

00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:58.005
Type a subject, write your
message and hit that send button.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.545
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:05.465
Now for the real masala, the techniques
that make you look like a pro.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:09.155
First try quick access,
toolbar customization.

00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:13.985
You can add your most used commands
there for one click access, saving

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.575
you from hunting through tabs.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:19.265
Also, never underestimate
contextual menus.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.430
Just right.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.140
Clicking on text sells or objects
brings up a handy menu with common

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.599
actions, which is often much faster.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.440
The format Painter on the
home tab is a magical tool.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.180
Use it to quickly copy formatting from
one place and apply it to another.

00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:41.375
In Excel, the fill handle, that tiny
square at the corner of a cell is

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:45.575
your best friend for quickly copying
content or extending a series of

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:48.635
numbers or dates for PowerPoint gurus.

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:53.465
Using the slide master view lets you
make design changes that apply to all

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:59.135
your slides at once, ensuring perfect
consistency and in newer office versions

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.815
that tell me what you want to do.

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:05.795
Search Bar is a genius feature for finding
commands without knowing where they live.

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:08.354
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:13.035
Alright, let's talk about the silly
mistakes so you can avoid them.

00:07:13.485 --> 00:07:15.645
A classic blunder is confusing.

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:19.215
File extensions like
thinking doc is for Excel.

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:21.735
Remember, each app has its own.

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:25.065
Another one is incorrect Shortcut usage.

00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:27.075
Please verify a shortcuts.

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:30.840
Don't go pressing control B
for break when it's for bold.

00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:37.484
Also, people often have a misunderstanding
of ribbon tabs, assuming every single

00:07:37.484 --> 00:07:42.104
option is under the home tab, but
many advanced features are hiding

00:07:42.104 --> 00:07:44.715
in insert page layout or review.

00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:48.974
In Excel, a common source
of tiers is formula errors.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.280
Like forgetting the equal sign before
a formula, and please my friend, do

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.530
not make the mistake of not saving.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.340
Frequently.

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.320
A system crash can ruin your day if
you haven't saved your masterpiece.

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:07.359
Lastly, a common rookie move is
overlooking print preview, which

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:11.710
often results in wasted paper
from bad margins or scaling.

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:12.820
Always check it.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.520
W Edge Framework summary.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.700
So to wrap it all up, simply, what is it?

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:22.359
A suite of software applications
for office productivity.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.820
Why do we use it to create, manage,
and present information efficiently?

00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:32.439
When is it used daily for
documents, data analysis,

00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:34.630
presentations, and communication?

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.770
Where is it applied in
workplaces, schools, and for

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.780
personal use all over the world.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.110
Who uses it?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.650
Basically anyone who
needs to do office tasks.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.120
And how does it work?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.440
Through user-friendly interfaces
with powerful tools for everything

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.390
you need fully worked out.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.690
Examples, example, one question.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.530
Which of the following keyboard
shortcuts is used to undo the

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.390
last action in Microsoft Word.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:11.540
A, control x, B, control ZC, control
YD control S understand the question

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.420
before moving to explanation solution.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.300
Step one, the question is straightforward.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.195
It asks for the UND undo shortcut.

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:22.675
Step two, let's recall
our common shortcut.

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:25.795
Step three, evaluating the options.

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:28.075
We know control X is for cut.

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:32.455
Control Z is the famous
shortcut for undo control.

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:36.535
Y is for redo, which is the
opposite of undo and control.

00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:37.825
S is for save.

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:38.965
Step four.

00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:43.885
Clearly based on this, control Z
is our hero for undoing the last

00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:47.140
action, correct answer B Ctrl Zed.

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:53.510
Example two question in Microsoft
Excel, what is the default file

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.640
extension for a workbook created
in versions 2007 and later?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:11.810
A Xls B. Do DCC do xlsx d Pptx understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:13.845
Solution.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:18.675
Step one, the question asks for
the modern Excel file extension,

00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:25.365
specifically for versions 2007 and newer
step two, we need to recall the file

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:30.015
extensions for office applications,
noting the change in newer versions.

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:32.834
Step three, let's check the options.

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:36.045
XLS is for older Excel versions.

00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:39.225
Do d. C is for older word versions.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.695
Do XL SX is the correct
extension for modern Excel.

00:10:43.995 --> 00:10:49.695
That X at the end is the key signifying
the newer XML based format and

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:52.515
do PTX is for modern PowerPoint.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:53.565
Step four.

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:59.655
Therefore do XL SX is the right answer
for modern Excel workbooks, correct?

00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:04.065
Answer C, Excel SX example three.

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:09.765
Question, which view in Microsoft
PowerPoint displays all slides

00:11:09.765 --> 00:11:14.115
in a miniature format, allowing
you to easily reorder, add or

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:16.845
delete slides a normal view.

00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:22.815
B slide show view, C outline
view, D slide sort of view.

00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:26.325
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:27.735
Solution.

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:28.785
Step one.

00:11:29.115 --> 00:11:33.195
The question describes a view in
PowerPoint for organizing slides

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:35.145
by showing them as thumbnails.

00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:39.945
Step two, let's think about the different
PowerPoint views and what they do.

00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:42.885
Step three, evaluating our options.

00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:45.915
Normal view is your main
editing screen for one.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.940
Slideshow view is for presenting
outline view shows the text

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.590
content slide sorter view, however
perfectly matches the description.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.690
It displays all slides as miniatures,
making it super easy to sort them.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.230
Step four, the functionality
described directly.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.090
Points to slide sorter view,
correct answer D slide sorter view.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.050
Thank you.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.580
See you in the next lecture.
