00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on word processing.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.110
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.470
This is it.

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:11.084
Concepts explanation.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:15.225
So what is this magic called
word processing array?

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:20.085
It's simply the art of creating,
editing, formatting, and printing

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.275
your text documents using a computer.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.405
It's all about using special software,
which we call word processes, to

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.200
play with text and make it look good.

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:34.945
Before all this fancy computer business,
our grandparents had typewriters.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:35.965
Oh boy.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.705
Making a correction on those was a
nightmare involving white ink and a

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:45.835
lot of frustration, but word processing
software changed the game completely.

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:51.150
It allows us to revise, rearrange,
and beautify our text with no swipe.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.010
You can add images, tables, and all
sorts of fancy things, and then save

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.710
it, share it, or print it out simple.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.905
Key functions of word processing
include, let's talk about

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:06.554
its key functions, shall we?

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:11.265
First, there's text entry, which is
just a sophisticated way of saying

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.125
you type words into a document.

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:15.645
Then comes editing the real superhero.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.760
This is where you fix your mistakes,
delete words that sound silly,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.950
or move whole paragraphs around.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.260
After that, we have formatting.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.780
This is the fashion show for your text.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.250
You change its appearance with
different fonts, sizes, and colors.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.039
You can also format paragraphs with
alignment and spacing, and even

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.179
set up your pages with margins and
those little notes at the top and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.370
bottom called headers and footers.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.570
Of course, there's saving and
retrieving, which lets you store your

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.150
masterpiece for later and open it again.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.419
Printing gives you a
physical hard poppy to hold.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.520
Most software also includes a spell
check and grammar check, which is like

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.750
having a tiny English teacher inside
your computer pointing out your errors.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.229
And one very powerful
feature is mail merge.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.090
This clever tool helps you
create personalized letters or

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.500
emails for a whole list of people
using just one main template.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.350
Common software you've probably heard of
include the King Microsoft Word, the Free

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.080
and Easy Google Docs Libre office writer,
and for the Apple fans, apple pages.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.890
Real world relevance.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.760
Now you might ask, sir,
why is this so important?

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.320
Well, my friend word processing
skills are absolutely fundamental

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.710
for good communication and managing
documents in any professional setting.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.800
Think about it for document creation.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.900
It's essential for drafting reports,
letters, and all official communications.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.950
It's used daily for professional
correspondence, like preparing

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.380
emails, memos, and formal letters.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.870
It also helps in record keeping, making
it easy to create and organize digital.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:06.395
When you're giving a presentation,
it's great for presentation support,

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:10.775
helping you prepare scripts or
handouts for data organization.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:15.305
It enables the creation of simple
tables and lists, and finally,

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:19.775
it brings communication, clarity,
allowing for clear, well formatted

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:23.465
documents that make sure everyone
understands what you're trying to say.

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.799
Breakdown of question types
when it comes to your exam.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.670
Questions on word processing usually
focus on practical knowledge.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.200
A huge chunk, about 40% will
be on keyboard shortcuts.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.820
They love asking for things like
Control plus S, or control plus C.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.640
The next biggest slice, 30% is on
feature identification or functionality

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.359
where they'll ask what a specific
feature like Mail Merge actually does.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.100
Then you have questions about file
formats, making up 15%, focusing

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.010
on extensions like DOC or do pdf.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.770
A smaller part, 10% is on basic
operations, like saving or printing.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.220
And the final 5% is on simple terminology,
defining words like header or margin.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:15.030
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.260
While there are no mathematical
formulas here, thank goodness, the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.149
trick is to understand the logic.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.120
Let's cover the most common shortcuts
we have control C for copy control,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.969
X for cut and control V for paste.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.770
Think of these three
as inseparable friends.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.289
Then there's control Z for undo
the magical oops button and control

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.420
Y to redo what you just undid.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.440
Control.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:43.270
S is for save control.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.380
P is for print.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.450
For formatting, you have control
B for bold control I. For italic

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.800
and control U for underline
control A selects everything.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.390
Control F helps you find a word
and control H lets you replace it.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.980
To start Fresh Control N gives you a
new document and control O lets you open

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.620
an existing one for file extensions.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.970
Remember that Doc and Doc
X belong to Microsoft Word.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.900
A dxt file is just plain
text with no style.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.450
An RTF or Rich text format has some
basic formatting, and A PDF is a portable

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.220
document format mainly for viewing, not
really for editing in a word processor.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.800
And please remember this simple rule
formatting changes the appearance while

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.990
editing changes the actual content.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.240
Methods of solving To answer
these questions effectively,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.530
you need a strategy.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.400
First, visualize the action
for a shortcut question.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.460
Just mentally press the
keys if it's control.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.650
S think I'm saving my work.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.750
Second, understand feature purpose.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.979
If a question describes a task like
sending personalized invites, your brain

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.200
should immediately scream mail merge.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.539
Third, if you're stuck, use the classic
technique, eliminate options, get rid

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.640
of the answers that are obviously wrong,
and finally look for contextual clues.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.780
Words in the question like layout
of the page, point towards margins

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.159
or orientation while appearance
of text, hints at font or color.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.555
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:23.055
Here's a smart tip.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.925
Most of the really common
actions like copy, paste, and

00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:28.635
save, use the control key.

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.135
Memorize this group.

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:33.975
Also, don't ignore the F keys
at the top of your keyboard.

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:37.995
F seven is your personal
proofreader for spell check and F

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:40.395
12 quickly opens the save as box.

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:45.135
A good real world habit, which is often
tested indirectly, is to save your

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:47.355
work frequently to prevent data loss.

00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:51.545
For documents you create, often
use templates to save time and

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.045
keep formatting consistent.

00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:57.755
And remember all the page layout
options like margins, orientation,

00:06:57.755 --> 00:07:02.165
and paper size are usually found
under a page layout or layout tab.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.760
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:08.280
Let's clear up some common confusions.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.400
People often mix up cut and copy, both put
data on the clipboard, but cut removes the

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.979
original text while copy leaves it behind.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.460
Also, don't assume all
doc files are the same.

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.299
The older doc files are different
from the newer XML based

00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:26.640
DOC files from 2007 onwards.

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:30.015
People also think delete
and cut are identical.

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:30.945
They are not.

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:35.295
Delete removes text forever
unless you undo it while cut,

00:07:35.295 --> 00:07:38.145
moves it to the clipboard so
you can paste it somewhere else.

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:41.055
A big misunderstanding
is about mail merge.

00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:42.945
It's not just for emails.

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:47.235
It's for creating any personalized
document from a template and a data list.

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:51.105
And please don't overlook
the power of undo and redo.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:54.165
They are your best friends
for fixing mistakes quickly.

00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:57.255
WH framework summary.

00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:01.335
So to summarize it all quickly,
what is word processing?

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:05.115
It's the creation and editing
of text documents on a computer.

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:06.645
Why is it important?

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.675
It helps you create professional
documents effectively.

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:10.885
When do you use it?

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:14.705
Basically, whenever you need
to write something from reports

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:16.805
to letters, where is it used?

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:19.625
Everywhere from big offices to schools.

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:20.765
Who uses it?

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:23.735
Every professional
friend and administrator.

00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:25.085
And how is it done?

00:08:25.295 --> 00:08:29.555
By using word processing software
to type, format, save and print.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.355
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:34.635
Let's try an example.

00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:35.685
Example.

00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:42.135
One question, which keyboard shortcut
is commonly used to save a document

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:44.745
in most word processing applications?

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:53.085
A, control plus C, B, control plus
X. C. Control plus S. D. Control

00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:57.525
plus P. Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.810
All right, let's break it down.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.810
The question wants the shortcut for save.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.620
Option A, control plus C is for copy.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.920
Option B control X is for cut.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.280
Option D, control P is for print.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.580
That leaves us with option C control S,
which is the universal shortcut for save.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.590
It's as simple as that.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.425
The correct answer is C.
Example, two question.

00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:32.855
You need to send personalized letters
to 50 different customers each with

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:37.955
their specific name and address, but the
main content of the letter is the same.

00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:42.185
Which word processing feature
would be most efficient for this?

00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:42.695
Task?

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:44.555
A. Spell check.

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:48.425
B. Find and replace C mail merge.

00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:50.315
D. Header and footer.

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:53.945
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.610
Let's analyze this.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.470
The goal is to make many personalized
letters from one main template.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.330
Option A, spell check, just
correct spelling, use less here.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:12.270
Option B, find and replace is good
for changing one word to another, but

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.670
it's not built for this kind of mass
Personalization from a data list, option

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:23.130
D, header and footer just puts the same
text at the top and bottom of every page.

00:10:23.535 --> 00:10:29.444
The only feature specifically designed
for this exact job is option C mail Merge.

00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:34.275
It merges a template with a data
source to create multiple unique

00:10:34.275 --> 00:10:38.324
documents, so C is a hero example.

00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:39.765
Three question.

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:45.285
Which of the following file extensions
typically indicates a standard Microsoft

00:10:45.285 --> 00:10:48.135
Word document created in newer versions?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.780
2007 and later?

00:10:50.439 --> 00:11:00.880
A txt B pdf C Doc D Docx understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:02.925
Okay.

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.035
Final question.

00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:07.755
We need the file extension
for newer Word documents.

00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:12.345
Option a T XT is plain
text, no formatting.

00:11:12.585 --> 00:11:17.445
Option b PDF is for viewing
not the native word format.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:23.710
Option C DOC is the extension for
older word documents from before 2007.

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:31.275
That leaves us with option D Doc X. The
X at the end stands for XML, and this

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:37.275
is the standard format for Word 2007 and
all later versions correct answer is D.

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:38.295
Thank you.

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:39.945
See you in the next lecture.

00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:39.975
I.
