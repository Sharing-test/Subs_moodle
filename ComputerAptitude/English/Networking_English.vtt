00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on networking.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.645
Concept explanation.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:15.165
Networking in the computer world is
basically the art of connecting two

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.545
or more devices so they can talk
to each other and share things.

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.125
Think of it like your colonies.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.835
Super efficient gossip network.

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:30.445
But for computers, they connect to share
resources like a single printer for the

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:36.295
whole office, the internet connection,
or to just exchange files and messages.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:42.144
These connections can be physical
using wires and cables, or they can be

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.700
wireless using magic signals in the air.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.460
What we call wifi, the main purpose,
the big idea is to get all these

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.459
devices to cooperate and work together
as one big, happy, efficient family.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:00:59.775
Real world relevance.

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:02.325
Now you ask where is this used?

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:09.255
RA everywhere, especially in banks for
secure transactions, banks need these

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:14.385
powerful networks to handle millions
of safe transactions every single day.

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:18.610
Making sure your money doesn't
just vanish into thin air.

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.995
For great customer service networking.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.255
Lets bank staff access your
data instantly, no matter

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.815
which branch you walk into.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:34.055
It also helps in data sharing, allowing
for smooth movement of important financial

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.785
data between different bank departments.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:42.435
And of course, the online banking and
mobile banking you use, that entire

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:47.565
fantastic experience is built on a
super secure and efficient network.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:52.425
It even enables interbank
communication, letting banks talk

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.495
to each other, to the central bank.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.070
And to financial institutions
all over the globe.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.930
Finally, it provides branch
connectivity connecting every single

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.820
branch to a central brain or server
for realtime updates and smooth

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.150
operations breakdown of question types.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.250
Now for your exam, what kind of
questions can you expect from this topic?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
Based on past patterns, the questions
usually follow a certain style.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.090
A big chunk, about 30 to 35% will be
on definitions and basic concepts.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.120
Asking things like, what is a network or
the difference between lan, wan, and man.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.675
Then about 25 to 30% of questions
will be on network devices.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.900
Testing.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.970
If you know the function of a hub
switch router or modem, another

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.150
15 to 20% will focus on networked
apologies like star bus or ring.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.700
A smaller part may be 10 to 15% will
check your understanding of common

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.946
protocols like TCP IP or HTTP.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.120
And the rest, a tiny five to 10% each will
touch upon the OS I slash TCP IP model and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.940
the basics of IP addressing and security.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.460
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.020
Now, networking doesn't have
math formulas like algebra, but

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.120
it has formulas for your memory.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.120
These are associations to help you recall
things instantly for network types,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.210
remember, LAN is local area network.

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.340
For a small area, like an office
man is Metropolitan Area Network.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.630
Think citywide.

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:41.975
And van is wide area network, which
is global, like the internet itself.

00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:47.825
For the famous OSI model layers, just
remember this silly sentence, please

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:50.045
do not throw sausage pizza away.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:56.555
That gives you physical data, link
network transport session presentation,

00:03:56.644 --> 00:03:58.685
and application layers in order.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:05.605
For the simpler TCP IP model, remember
AAN application, transport, internet,

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:08.545
and network access for devices.

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:12.774
A hub is a dumb device that
just broadcasts to everyone.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:18.024
A switch is smarter, its sends data to
a specific device using its MAC address.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.260
A router is the traffic
police that connects different

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.360
networks using IP addresses.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.970
A modem is a modulator demo modulator,
a translator between digital and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.550
analog signals, and for protocols.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.790
Remember, HTTP is for web browsing
while H-T-T-P-S is the secure version.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.030
FTP is for file transfer and SMTP is
for sending emails while POP three

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.100
or imap are for receiving them.

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.530
Lastly, DNS is the phone
book of the internet.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.780
It translates website names to
IP addresses, methods of solving.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.360
So how do you crack these questions?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.849
First, use definition recall.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.580
If a question asks, what is X?

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.400
You just need to remember
the exact definition.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.830
Second, use functionality mapping for
questions about devices or protocols

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.640
match the function described in the
question with the correct option.

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.034
Third is layer association.

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:23.405
If the question mentions the OSI or
TCP IP model, you have to associate

00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:25.055
the task with the correct layer.

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:27.695
Fourth, try scenario analysis.

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:32.795
If they give you a situation like a
company connecting two offices, analyze

00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:37.805
the needs, like distance and security to
pick the right network type or device,

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:41.105
and finally use comparison and contrast.

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:44.745
For questions that ask for the
difference between a hub and a

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:48.975
switch, for example, focus only on
their key distinguishing features.

00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:54.375
Shortcuts and smart techniques
for some smart jugar.

00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:59.145
Always expand acronyms in your mind
like LAN to reinforce the meaning.

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:01.935
Also, practice keyword spotting.

00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:06.914
If you see connect's different networks,
your brain should scream router.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:11.534
If you see broadcasts,
think hub, see secure web.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.155
Think H-T-T-P-S.

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:15.015
This is a game changer.

00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:18.105
The elimination strategy
is your best friend.

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:22.095
When you're not sure, get rid of
the obviously wrong answers first.

00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:24.945
Also look for contextual clues.

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.815
If the question is about email,
your answer will likely be

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:30.465
an email related protocol.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:33.795
And finally, try a bit
of visual association.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:38.865
Try to create a mental picture of a
network topology or how a device works.

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:40.155
It really helps.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.620
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.200
Be careful of these common traps.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.510
Many people confuse a hub which
broadcasts to all with a switch, which

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.880
smartly sends to a specific destination.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.330
Also, don't mix up a router and a switch.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.420
Routers connect different
networks while switches.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.520
Connect devices within the same network.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.780
People also underestimate
the geographic scope.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.340
LAN is local.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.690
WAN is wide.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.909
A classic mistake is forgetting.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:15.560
The S in H-T-T-P-S stands for
secure meaning encryption.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.010
Another is mixing up
protocols for sending email.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.470
Which is SMTP with protocols for receiving
it like POP three and imap, and please

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.900
learn the OSI layer order correctly.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.840
Lastly, understand that an IP address is
logical and can change, but a MAC address

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.940
is physical and fixed to the device.

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.745
WH framework summary.

00:07:39.045 --> 00:07:42.345
So to wrap it all up
quickly, what is networking?

00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:45.825
It's the interconnection of
computers to share resources.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.085
Why do we do it?

00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:50.595
To enable communication and
efficient data exchange.

00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:51.975
When is it applied?

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:53.715
Basically all the time.

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:55.605
Whenever devices need to connect.

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:56.925
Where is it used?

00:07:57.105 --> 00:08:00.045
From our homes and offices
to the entire globe.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.690
Who benefits all of us,
individuals, businesses, everyone.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.160
And how does it work through all
those network devices, cables,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.265
signals, and protocols we discussed.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.280
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.110
Let's solve some examples.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:22.080
Example, one question, which of the
following network devices operates at

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.540
the data link layer of the OSI model and
is primarily used to connect segments

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.580
of a LAN forwarding data only to the
specific port of the destination device.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.740
A hub, B router, C switch, D repeater.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.340
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.010
All right, let's break it down.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.290
The question has two big clues.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.069
Data linked layer and
forwards to a specific port.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.530
A hub is out because it's a physical
layer device and broadcasts to everyone.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.420
A router is also out.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.170
It works at the network layer
connecting different networks.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.980
A repeater just boosts the
signal at the physical layer

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.140
that leaves us with the switch.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.840
A switch perfectly fits the description.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:16.690
It operates at the data link layer and
smartly sends data only to the intended

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.350
devices port correct answer c switch.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.770
Example two question.

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:27.540
Which protocol is responsible for
translating human readable website

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.220
addresses into numerical IP addresses
that computers can understand.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.319
A-H-T-T-P-B-F-T-P-C-D-N-S-D-S-M-T-P
understand the question

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.120
before moving to explanation.

00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:43.444
Okay.

00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:49.234
The core task here is translating a
name like google.com into a number.

00:09:49.385 --> 00:09:50.525
It's IP address.

00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:52.295
Let's look at the options.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.724
HTTP is for webpages.

00:09:55.084 --> 00:09:57.305
FTP is for file transfers.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:59.704
SMTP is for sending emails.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.140
None of them are translators.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.190
The correct answer is DNS,
the domain name system.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.880
Its entire job is to be
the Internet's phone book.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.270
Translating names to
numbers, correct answer.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.800
CDNS.

00:10:15.435 --> 00:10:17.145
Example three question.

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:22.245
A large bank wants to connect its main
headquarters in Mumbai with its regional

00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:24.915
offices across different states in India.

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:28.815
Which type of network would be
most suitable for this purpose?

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:37.305
A. Lan B man, C Wan D Pan understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:38.625
Okay.

00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:41.835
The keyword here is
across different states.

00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:45.135
This implies a very
large geographical area.

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.465
A LAN is too small just for one building.

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:52.155
A man covers a city, which
is also not big enough.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:56.475
A pan is a personal area network
just for your own devices,

00:10:56.715 --> 00:10:58.635
so that's definitely wrong.

00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:03.495
The only option that covers vast
distances like states and countries

00:11:03.615 --> 00:11:05.985
is a van, a wide area network.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.190
Correct answer.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.420
See one.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.410
Thank you.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.685
See you in the next lecture.
