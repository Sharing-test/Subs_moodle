00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on basics of logic gates.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.510
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.450
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.640
So what are these logic gates?

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.690
You ask array?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.380
They are the fundamental
building blocks, the bricks and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.509
cement of any digital system.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.420
Think of them as tiny electronic circuits,
little decision makers inside a computer.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.730
They take one or more binary inputs,
which is just a fancy way of saying

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.130
zero or one representing low or high
voltage, and then produce a single

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.340
binary output based on a very specific
logical rule types of logic gates.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.910
There are several types of
these gates, each with its own

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.340
personality and unique logical job.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.780
First we have the and gate.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.820
This one is very strict.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.720
The output is one only if
all its inputs are one.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.540
Otherwise, it gives a big fad zero.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.430
For example, if A is zero and
B is zero, output is zero.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.710
A is zero, and B is one.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.150
Output is still zero.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.015
A is one, and B is zero.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:16.865
Output is again, zero, only
when A is one and B is one.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:18.155
The output is one.

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:19.955
Next is the orate.

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:22.145
This one is more relaxed.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.615
The output is one.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:25.235
If any, input is one.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:29.345
The only way it gives a zero
is if all inputs are zero.

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:33.274
So if A and B are both,
zero, output is zero.

00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:36.850
But if A is zero and B
is one, output is one.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.890
A is one and zero.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.110
Output is one, and if A and B are
both, one, output is of course one.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.980
Then there's the knot gate,
also called the inverter.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.690
This one is a rebel.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.130
It has only one input, and it's
output is always the opposite.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.810
If you give it a one, it gives you a zero.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.290
If you give it a zero, it
gives you a one simple.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.810
Now, for the combinations, the Nand
gate is basically a knot and gate.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.850
It's an and gate followed by a
knot gate, so it's output is zero.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.890
Only when all inputs a one.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.680
Otherwise, the output is always one.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.000
This gate is a universal gate
because you can build any other

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.980
gate using only Nan Gates.

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:23.244
Very powerful.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:29.845
Similarly, we have the norgate or not,
or an OR gate followed by a not gate.

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:33.625
Its output is one only
when all inputs are zero.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:35.845
Otherwise, the output is zero.

00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:37.765
Like its cousin nand.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.774
It is also a universal gate.

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:45.325
Then comes the xor gate or exclusive,
or this one is interesting.

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:49.614
The output is one only if the inputs
are different from each other.

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:53.575
So if A is one and B
is zero, output is one.

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:59.425
If the inputs are the same, like zero and
zero, or one and one, the output is zero.

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:05.485
Finally, the X nor gate or
exclusive, nor it's an X or

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.080
gate with a knot gate attached.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.055
It's the exact opposite of xr.

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:14.915
The output is one, if the inputs
are the same, and zero, if they are

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.704
different, real world relevance.

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:21.575
Now you might be thinking,
sir, this is all theory.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.424
Where is the real world connection array?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.625
It's everywhere.

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:30.065
Understanding logic gates is
absolutely crucial for knowing

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:32.075
how our digital world functions.

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:36.725
Especially in something as
important as banking systems from

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:40.385
transaction processing to the
security that guards your money.

00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:45.125
They are the core of decision
making in computer networks and

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:46.924
automated banking operations.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:52.834
Think of transaction validation,
security ATMs and their embedded systems.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:57.755
Digital authorization logic,
even credit score evaluation at

00:03:57.755 --> 00:03:59.525
the hardware and software level.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:04.925
The big banking servers and network
routers are all powered by these

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:10.805
simple but brilliant gates, breakdown
of question types for your exam.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.500
You should know the kind
of questions to expect.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.930
About 30% of questions will ask
you to identify a gait type just

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.670
from its symbol or truth table.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.520
Another 25% will involve completing
truth tables for given expressions.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.230
Around 20% will test your skills
in simplifying Boolean expressions.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:37.665
A smaller 15% will ask you to analyze a
full logic circuit to find its output.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:42.615
And finally, a tricky 10%
might involve gait conversion.

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:48.945
For example, building an and gate using
only Nan Gates formulas and tricks.

00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:54.945
To become a master, you need to know the
magic formulas first, you must memorize

00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:56.955
the truth tables for all the gates.

00:04:57.345 --> 00:05:00.045
Then come the Boolean algebra identities.

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:01.305
Remember these?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.400
A plus zero is a a plus one is
one A multiplied by zero Is zero.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.240
A multiplied by one is a a plus.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.080
Its opposite.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.800
A prime is one A
multiplied by its opposite.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.240
A prime is zero.

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.950
Also A plus A is just A and
A times A is also just a. The

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.260
double negative or a prime.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.600
Prime is simply A, and don't forget
the superstars d Morgan's theorems.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.030
The first is A B prime
equals A prime plus B prime.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.000
The second is A plus B. Prime
equals A prime, B prime.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.000
These are your best
friends for simplification.

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:49.545
Methods of solving.

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:51.975
So how do we attack the problems?

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.375
There are a few standard methods.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.105
First is truth table construction.

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:00.375
You identify all your input variables.

00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:04.125
Then you list all possible
combinations of inputs.

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:09.135
Remember, for N inputs, you have
two to the power of end combinations

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:14.295
For each combination, you find the
output of each gate step by step

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.425
until you get the final output.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.909
Second is Boolean Alge
algebra Simplification.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.580
Here you write the logic circuit as a
Boolean expression, and then apply all

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.650
those lovely identities and theorems,
especially D Morgans, to simplify it

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.349
until it can't be simplified anymore.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.780
Third is circuit analysis.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.120
This is like being a detective.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.310
You assign binary values.

00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:42.695
Like zero or one to the inputs.

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:47.315
And then trace these values through
each gate, calculating the output

00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:51.335
one by one until you reach the
final output for the whole circuit.

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:53.885
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:57.845
Now for the smart techniques,
the jugar of Logic Gates.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:00.665
First, universal gait recognition.

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.825
Just burn this into your brain.

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:05.255
Nand and nor are universal.

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.105
They can be configured
to make any other gait.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:11.275
Second for D Morgan's quick application.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:16.315
When you see a complement over multiple
variables, just change the operator

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:21.924
inside and to, or, or, or to, and and
complement each variable individually.

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:23.664
It's a huge time saver.

00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:27.294
Third, use pattern
recognition in truth tables.

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:29.155
Quickly spot the patterns.

00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:34.164
If you see a truth table that is all
zeroes except for the very last row,

00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:36.474
your brain should immediately shout.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.419
And gate.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.740
Finally, for very simple
circuits, use visual inspection.

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.140
Don't waste time on a full truth table.

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:48.789
Often you can just trace the inputs
with your eyes and get the answer.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.640
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.505
Please be careful of these
common traps my friend.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.280
A classic error is confusing.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.130
Nand or nor with, and or, or always
remember, the N means not so.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.240
NAND is not.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.980
And another big one is the incorrect
application of d Morgan's theorem.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.060
People often forget to compliment
all the individual variables.

00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:17.725
Also watch out for silly errors
in truth table rows like missing a

00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:23.335
combination or a calculation mistake,
and please do not misinterpret X or

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:26.575
X, nor XR means different inputs.

00:08:26.575 --> 00:08:29.725
Give one and XNOR means same inputs.

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:30.325
Give one.

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:35.265
Lastly, while ignoring input
order is fine, for many gates, it

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:39.765
is good practice to maintain the
order to avoid confusion in complex

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:42.615
circuits W Edge Framework summary.

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:44.955
So let's wrap it up in a nutshell.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.815
What are Logic Gates.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.070
They are digital electronic
circuits doing logical operations.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.600
Why are they important?

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.470
They are the fundamental basis
of all digital systems and

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.510
computers for making decisions.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.760
When are they used in designing
microprocessors, memory units, control

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.520
systems, and almost all digital devices?

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.675
Where are they found?

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.350
Inside computers, calculators, your
mobile phone, ATMs, basically every modern

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.660
electronic gadget who deals with them?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.470
Electrical engineers and
computer scientists, and anyone

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.970
in digital circuit design.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.310
And how do they work Simple by taking
binary inputs and producing a single

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.310
binary output based on a predefined rule.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.150
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.920
Let's solve some problems.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.080
Example, one question.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.740
Which of the following Logic
Gates has an output of one?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.450
Only when both of its inputs
are different, A and B or C.

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:51.875
X-O-R-D-X-N-O-R understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:55.565
The question is asking for a
gait where the output is one.

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:59.765
When inputs are different, like
zero and one or one and zero,

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:01.925
let's recall our truth tables.

00:10:02.285 --> 00:10:05.435
The and gait gives one
only when both inputs are.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.570
The OR Gate gives one if
at least one Input is one.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.820
The X norgate gives one.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.980
When inputs are the same, the x, O or
gate is the one that gives an output of

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.260
one only when the inputs are different.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:25.620
So the correct answer is C. Example two
question, simplify the Boolean expression

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:33.160
A, A plus B. A A, B, B, C, A plus B, DAB.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.220
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.940
Okay?

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.290
Let's simplify this.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.740
We start with A, A plus B first.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.050
We apply the distributive
law, which gives us.

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:50.470
A, A plus A point B. Now we use
the I Potent law, which says

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:56.170
that a point A is just A, so our
expression becomes A plus a B.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.270
Finally, we apply the absorption
law, which states that A plus A

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.950
point B is simply A, so the entire
expression simplifies down to

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.020
just a, the correct answer is.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.490
A example three question.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.120
What is the final output X of
the following logic circuit.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.760
If input A is equal to one and input
B is equal to zero, assume the circuit

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.040
consists of an and gate with inputs A and
B, followed by a knot gate on its output.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:33.140
A zero B one, CAD, B, understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.700
Let's trace the values.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.910
The circuit is an and gate
followed by a knot gate.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.960
This is actually a N gate.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.710
The inputs are A equals
one and B equals zero.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.190
These go into the and gate
first for an and gate.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.400
If the inputs are one and
zero, the output is zero.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.150
This output of zero then becomes
the input for the knot gate.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.000
The knot gate inverts its input, so an
input of zero becomes an output of one.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.310
The final output X is therefore
one correct answer is B. Thank you.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.690
See you in the next lecture.
