00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.390
Welcome my friend to today's lecture on
introduction to Computer Organization.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.700
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.360
Concept explanation.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.900
So what is this computer organization?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.340
You ask Array.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
It's simply how a computer system
is built and how all its different

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.979
parts are connected and talk to
each other to get things done.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.320
Think of it like a human body.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.619
Yeah.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
We have a brain, a heart, limbs,
and they all work together.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
It's the same with a computer,
which at its heart has hardware,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.150
the physical bits you can touch and
software the programs and instructions.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.870
You can't.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.769
The basic functional units of a computer.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.880
All thanks to the Von Neumann
architecture are a few key players.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.000
First up, the central processing unit
or CPU, we all call it the brain of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
the computer, and for good reason, this
fellow is responsible for executing

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.259
all instructions, doing all the maths,
and basically managing the entire show.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.910
Inside this brain, there
are three main departments.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.050
First is the Arithmetic
Logic Unit or a LU.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.310
This is the master accountant
doing all the arithmetic, like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.390
addition, subtraction, and all
the logical comparisons, like

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.040
greater than or less than.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.310
Next is the control unit or cu.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.780
Think of it as the director of
a movie or maybe a traffic cop.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.150
It fetches instructions from memory.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.550
Figures out what they mean
and then tells all the other

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.800
components what to do and when.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.289
Finally, we have registers.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.289
These are tiny but super fast storage
spots right inside the CPU that hold

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.460
data instructions and addresses for
a little while during processing.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.820
Next is the memory unit.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.899
This is where the computer stores
all its data and instructions.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.390
It's divided into two main types.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.030
Primary memory or main memory is
super fast, but also very moody and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
volatile, meaning it forgets everything
the moment the power goes off.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.280
The best examples are ram
or random access memory.

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:24.445
Which is used for temporary storage
of programs and data that are

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:29.545
currently active, and then there
is ROM or read only memory, which

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:33.144
stores permanent instructions,
like how to boot up the computer.

00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:37.734
It's non-volatile, so it remembers
everything even without power.

00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:42.234
Then comes the secondary memory,
also called auxiliary storage.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.800
This is the slow and steady, non-volatile
memory used for keeping huge amounts

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.990
of data and programs for the long term.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.670
This is your hard disk drive,
your SSD, your USP pen drive,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.920
and even old CDs and DVDs.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.329
The input unit is quite simple.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.100
These are all the devices that
let you, the user feed data and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.750
instructions into the computer.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.059
Your keyboard, mouse, scanner, and
microphone are all perfect examples.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.760
And of course we have the output unit.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.299
These devices show you the
final processed results.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.704
Your monitor, your printer, your speakers,
they all bring the computer's work to you.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400
Finally, how do all these parts
communicate through buses?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.290
No, not the ones on the road.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.150
These are sets of electrical super
highways that connect all the components.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.870
There's the data bus, which
carries the actual data between

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.360
the CPU memory and IO devices.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.680
There's the address bus, which carries
memory addresses from the CPU to point

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.540
to the exact location for data and
the control bus, which carries control

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.710
signals from the control unit to
manage and synchronize everyone's work.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.550
Real world relevance.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.600
Now, why should you care
about all this internal drama?

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.640
Because understanding computer
organization is incredibly useful in

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.190
the real world for system performance.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.970
Knowing how the CPU and Memory
Chat helps you understand your

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.960
computer speed for troubleshooting
a little hardware knowledge.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.695
Can help you figure out what's
wrong with your machine.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:26.075
It helps in resource management by
letting you efficiently manage your

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:28.145
computer's power for different tasks.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.234
It's also crucial for
software compatibility.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.414
Understanding the hardware's
limits helps you choose the

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:36.995
right software for data security.

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:42.424
Knowing about storage helps you handle
your data more safely, and for technology

00:04:42.424 --> 00:04:46.984
upgrades, you can make much smarter
decisions about which new parts to buy

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:48.905
when you have a good grasp of this.

00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:53.295
Breakdown of question types in your exam.

00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:55.815
Questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.985
About 45% of the time, they
will ask you about component

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:01.784
identification and function.

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:07.215
They'll just ask you to name a part like
a LU or RAM and describe its main job.

00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:11.835
Around 30% of questions are on
memory types and characteristics.

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:15.794
These will test if you can tell
the difference between RAM and rom.

00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:19.905
Primary and secondary memory
are volatile and non-volatile.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:26.114
About 15% of questions are on input
output devices simply asking for examples.

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.090
A tiny 5% will be on data flow or
interaction, asking very basic questions

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.030
on how data moves around, and the last
5% is just on terminology, asking for

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.400
definitions of words like bus or register.

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:43.545
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:48.975
The good news is there are no complicated
mathematical formulas here, but you

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:51.165
must memorize some key relationships.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:55.665
Just think of it this way, the
CPU is the brain, the central

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:57.315
hub for processing and control.

00:05:57.765 --> 00:06:01.005
Inside it, the A LU
does the math and logic.

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:04.215
The CU is the director
controlling everything.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.655
Registers are the CPU's, fast
temporary storage, the smallest

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:09.835
and fastest memory of all.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.690
RAM is volatile main memory
for active work that disappears

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.710
when the power is cut.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.440
ROM is non-volatile and permanent storing
boot up instructions and it always remains

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.170
Primary memory is basically RAM plus rom
the memory the CPU can access directly.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.730
Secondary memory is for long-term
storage, like your hard drives and SSDs.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.170
Input devices.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.440
Get data in like a
keyboard or mouse output.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.820
Devices, push data out like a
monitor or printer, and buses are the

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.560
pathways that connect everything for
data addresses and control signals.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.169
Methods of solving to solve questions on
this topic, A conceptual approach is king.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.239
First, always identify the core
function for any component they mention.

00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:59.940
Ask yourself, what is its primary job?

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.359
Is it processing, storing input or output?

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:06.000
Second, distinguish memory types.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.070
When you see a memory question, focus on
its volatility, speed, and its purpose.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.919
Is it for temporary work
or long-term storage?

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.830
Third, trace the data flow conceptually.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.380
Remember, the general path data comes from
an input device, goes to memory, then to

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.300
the CPU for processing, back to memory,
and finally out through an output device.

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.250
Fourth, categorize devices clearly
classify if a device is strictly

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.300
for input, strictly for output, or
sometimes both like a touch screen.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.060
And finally, understand the bus purpose.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.420
Just remember, buses are
the communication channels.

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:45.645
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:48.045
Everyone loves a good shortcut, right?

00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:50.925
For the CPU, remember the acronyms.

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:57.345
A LU stands for arithmetic Logic Unit, CU
for control, unit for memory volatility.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.175
Just remember this little rhyme.

00:07:59.565 --> 00:08:00.645
RAM is random.

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:05.025
It vanishes because it's
volatile, and RO is read only.

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:07.365
It remains because it's non-volatile.

00:08:07.775 --> 00:08:11.675
For primary versus secondary memory,
think of primary as your on the

00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:15.575
fly, work memory, and secondary
as your long-term storage trunk.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.175
For input output, just think
of your daily computer use.

00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:20.435
Typing is input.

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:25.385
Seeing it on screen is output, and for
the bus types, the name gives it away.

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:27.275
The data bus carries data.

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:31.925
The address bus carries addresses, and
the control bus carries control signals.

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:35.175
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:39.375
All right, let's look at the
common traps to avoid a very

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:40.995
common mistake is confusing.

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:46.005
RAM and ro, please my friend, understand
the difference in volatility and purpose.

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:48.015
RAM is for your active work.

00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:49.995
ROM is for permanent boot up instructions.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:53.925
Another mistake is thinking
the CPU is just one thing.

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:58.545
Remember, it has distinct parts,
the A-L-U-C-U and registers

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:00.105
each with a specific job.

00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:03.705
Misidentifying input output
devices can also be tricky.

00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:06.645
Some devices like a
touch screen or a modem.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.110
Are actually both input and output
and don't overlook the buses.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.710
They aren't flashy devices, but
they're absolutely critical for

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.370
communication and often show up
in questions about data transfer.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.910
Finally, don't believe all
memory is equally fast.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.010
There is a clear speed hierarchy.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.540
Registers are the fastest, followed
by cash, then ram, and finally

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.070
the slow secondary storage.

00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:32.985
W Edge Framework summary.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:37.905
So to wrap it up with a quick summary,
what is computer organization?

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:41.205
It's the structural and
functional relationship between

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.795
the computer's, hardware parts.

00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:44.355
Why is it important?

00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:47.925
It defines how a computer
actually processes information

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:49.545
and executes instructions.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.710
When is it applied?

00:09:51.255 --> 00:09:55.064
In the design and understanding
of absolutely any computer system

00:09:55.155 --> 00:10:00.135
from a tiny smartwatch to a massive
supercomputer, where is it found in

00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:02.265
every single digital device you own?

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.125
And who needs to know this?

00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:09.074
Architects, engineers, and even users
like you who want to understand system

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:11.625
performance and how does it all work?

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:14.505
Through the beautifully
coordinated operation of the

00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:17.655
CPU memory IO devices and buses.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.280
Fully worked out examples.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.590
Let's tackle a few examples.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.260
Example, one question.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.240
Which component of the central
processing unit CPU is responsible

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.110
for performing arithmetic
calculations and logical operations?

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:42.960
A control unit, B registers, C, arithmetic
logic, unit D, memory unit, understand

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.880
the question before moving to explanation.

00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:48.735
Okay, let's analyze this.

00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:53.565
The question is very specific,
which CPU part does arithmetic

00:10:53.565 --> 00:10:55.935
calculations and logical operations?

00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:57.705
Let's check the options.

00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:01.305
Option A, the control
unit is the director.

00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:02.745
It doesn't do the math.

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:06.855
Option B registers are
just for temporary storage.

00:11:07.114 --> 00:11:08.795
They don't perform operations.

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:14.885
Option C, the Arithmetic Logic Unit Array,
the name itself tells you the answer.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.094
It performs arithmetic
and logical operations.

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:23.045
This is our match option D. The
memory unit only stores things,

00:11:23.314 --> 00:11:25.204
so the conclusion is clear.

00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:29.334
Correct answer C. Example two question.

00:11:29.725 --> 00:11:33.685
Which of the following statements
best describes random access?

00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:34.165
Memory?

00:11:34.704 --> 00:11:40.225
A. It is a non-volatile memory used for
long-term storage of programs and data.

00:11:40.584 --> 00:11:44.574
B, it is a type of primary
memory that loses its data

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:46.135
when the power is turned off.

00:11:46.464 --> 00:11:50.185
C, it stores permanent boot up
instructions for the computer.

00:11:50.495 --> 00:11:55.445
D, it is typically slower than secondary
storage devices, like hard drives.

00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:58.380
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.480
Right.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.660
This question wants the
best description for ram.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.670
Let's go through them one by one.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.480
Option A says, Ram is non-volatile wrong.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.920
RAM is volatile.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.450
It forgets everything.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.120
Long-term storage is for secondary memory.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.699
So A is false.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.949
Option B says, RAM is primary memory
and loses data when power is off.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.370
This is a perfect description
of Ram's volatile nature.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.719
This looks correct.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.020
Option C says it stores
boot up instructions.

00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:31.939
Nope, that's the job of ro.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.530
So C is false.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.800
Option D says RAM is
slower than hard drives.

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:38.180
Absolutely not.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.189
Ram is much, much faster.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.050
So D is also false.

00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:47.205
The conclusion is that option B is
the only accurate statement, correct

00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:50.475
answer B. Example three question.

00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:54.855
A device that accepts data from
the user and converts it into a

00:12:54.855 --> 00:13:00.285
form understandable by the computer
is known as an A output device.

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:02.235
B processing device.

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:04.005
C storage device.

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:08.655
D input device understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.120
Let's analyze this last question.

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:17.610
The key phrases are accepts data from the
user and converts it for the computer.

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:21.449
This is clearly about getting
information into the computer.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.860
So let's see.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:28.475
Option A output device shows information
to the user opposite of what we want.

00:13:29.084 --> 00:13:33.975
Option B processing device like
the CPU works on data but doesn't

00:13:33.975 --> 00:13:36.015
primarily accept it from the user.

00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:42.464
Option C storage device just holds
data that leaves option D input device.

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:44.865
This is its exact job description.

00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:48.375
Taking user data and
translating it for the computer.

00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:49.635
Think of a keyboard.

00:13:49.844 --> 00:13:52.365
This is a perfect fit, correct answer.

00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:53.865
D. Thank you.

00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:55.395
See you in the next lecture.
