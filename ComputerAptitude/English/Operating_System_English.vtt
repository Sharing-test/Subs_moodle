00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on operating system.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.270
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.120
So what is this operating system
or os as the cool kids call it?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.860
Ra, it's simple.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.640
It's like the main manager,
the big boss of your computer.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.265
It is a very special software that
acts as a conductor for an orchestra.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.490
Making sure all the different
parts, your keyboard, mouse, screen,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.690
even your stubborn printer, work
together in beautiful harmony.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.680
Think of it as the computer's
brain telling everything

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.690
else what to do and when.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.580
Without an os, your laptop is
just a very expensive paperweight.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.035
It wouldn't know how to run programs.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.940
Save your precious files or even
show your face on the screen.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.430
It expertly manages all the computer's,
resources from memory and processing

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.770
power to files and connected devices,
making the whole experience easy for you.

00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:08.160
Real world relevance.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.740
Now, where do you see this magic?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.729
In the real world?

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:14.460
In banking, it's the unsung hero.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.039
It ensures all the banking software runs
smoothly for lightning fast transactions.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
It's the security guard failure money
managing who gets access to what?

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:29.160
Protecting all that sensitive
customer financial data ever used.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.020
An ATM thank the os.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
It powers those machines, making
sure you get your cash reliably.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.070
It's also the network manager connecting
all the bank branches so they can talk to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.110
each other, and it supports the customer
service systems, helping bank employees

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.300
assist you without pulling their hair out.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.550
Basically, it's a master of
resource allocation, juggling

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.009
all the computers tasks at once.

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.845
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.545
There are a few ways they
will try to trick you.

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:09.405
First, a big chunk about 40%
of questions will be on the

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:11.355
definition and basic functions.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.115
Asking things like, what is an os?

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:19.005
Another 25% of questions focus on
the different types of operating

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.895
systems like single user.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.230
Multi-user or mobile os.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.959
Then about 15% of questions might
get a bit technical asking about the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.540
components like the kernel or the shell.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.019
A smaller 10% will just ask you to
identify examples like Windows or Android,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.299
and the final 10% will touch on the
basics of process and memory management.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.930
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.070
Don't worry.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.210
There are no scary formulas
for this topic, but we do have

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.829
some handy tricks to remember.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.900
First, always remember the OS is
the bridge between the hardware

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.400
and the software you use.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.350
Second, the kernel is the core,
the absolute heart of the os.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.360
Third, just think of the OS as the
ultimate resource manager for the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.630
CPU memory and all connected devices.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.890
Also, it's wise to memorize
common examples for different

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.030
OS types, like windows for
desktops and Android for mobiles.

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:26.705
And a key fact, the OS is the first thing
loaded into memory when your computer is

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.220
starting up a process we call booting.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.649
Methods of solving.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.600
So how do you tackle the questions
for definition or function questions?

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.440
Read it carefully and recall
the primary role of an os,

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.209
which is managing resources.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.109
Then look for the option
that best describes this job.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:51.825
For questions about types or examples, you
must first identify what is being asked,

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:55.335
a type like mobile OS, or a specific name.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:04:00.015
Then just match the options to the
characteristics you have hopefully

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.865
memorized for component questions.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:06.674
Understand which part of the
OS is being talked about.

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.575
Is it the core, the user
interface or something else?

00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:16.274
Then simply associate the function
with the right component like kernel

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:21.825
for core operations, shortcuts,
and smart techniques to be really

00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:24.015
clever, use the elimination method.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.409
If you are unsure, just get rid of
the options that are obviously wrong.

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:33.099
Often one or two are completely unrelated.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.580
Another great trick is
keyword association.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.830
Connect terms in your mind like
kernel with core, or scheduling

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.330
with process management.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.965
Also pay attention to contextual
clues in the question itself.

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:54.375
If it says multiple users, you should
immediately think Multi-user os.

00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:59.925
And when in doubt, my friend, always
fall back to the OSS primary role.

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:03.765
It's the manager that
makes the computer usable.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:06.795
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:10.215
Please do not fall into
these common traps.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.990
A big one is confusing
the OS with applications.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:16.724
Ms. Word is not an os.

00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:18.495
It runs on an os.

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:23.835
Another mistake is believing Windows is
the only operating system in the world.

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:30.224
Remember, Linux, Mac, os, Android
and iOS are all major players.

00:05:30.675 --> 00:05:36.344
Also, don't forget that managing the
physical hardware is a key role of the os.

00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:41.115
A common confusion is thinking
the kernel is the entire os.

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:44.955
No, it is just the central
most important part.

00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:48.495
And finally, don't
overlook file management.

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:53.234
Organizing, storing and finding
your files is a crucial OS

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:56.175
function, WH framework summary.

00:05:56.534 --> 00:06:01.155
So to summarize it all with
the WH framework, what is it?

00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:05.025
It's software that manages
all computer resources.

00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:09.734
Why does it exist to provide
a. Platform for apps and let

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:11.534
us interact with the computer.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.034
When is it used?

00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:16.034
Every single time a computer is on.

00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:17.505
Where is it found?

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:24.075
On everything from your phone to a giant
supercomputer who benefits all of us

00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:27.344
users, developers, and hardware makers.

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:29.025
And how does it do it?

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:33.075
By being the middleman,
allocating resources, and

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:35.325
managing every single process.

00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:38.505
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:40.244
Let's try a question.

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:42.765
Example, one question.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:47.354
Which of the following is the primary
function of an operating system?

00:06:47.804 --> 00:06:50.565
A, to create documents and spreadsheets.

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:55.005
B, to manage computer, hardware
and software resources.

00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:57.405
C. To browse the internet.

00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.715
D to play video games.

00:07:00.224 --> 00:07:03.164
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.870
The question wants the primary function.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.580
Let's look at the options.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.170
Option A. Creating documents
is for software like Ms. Word,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.930
that's an application, not the os.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.610
Option C, browsing the internet
is the job of a web browser.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.990
Another application.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:28.000
Option D. Playing games also requires
application software, but option

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.920
B to manage computer hardware and
software resources is the perfect

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.230
description of the OSS main job.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.560
It's the manager of everything, correct?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.599
Answer B. Example two question.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.669
Which component of an operating
system acts as the core and manages

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:53.280
the system's resources, including the
CPU, memory and input output devices?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:59.310
A Shell, B kernel, C compiler
D application software.

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:03.120
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.290
Here, the keywords are component and core.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.940
Let's check our options.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.620
The shell option A is the
interface you use to give commands.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.140
It's the outer layer, not the core.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.430
A compiler.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.270
Option C is a tool for
programmers that translates code.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.140
It's not part of the OS
core application software.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.380
Option D are programs that run on the os.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.620
That leaves us with option B, the
kernel, and that's exactly right.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.620
The kernel is the central core component
that manages all the essential resources.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.490
Correct.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.444
Answer B. Example three question.

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:48.885
Which of the following is an example
of a mobile operating system?

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:56.895
A. Microsoft Windows B. Mac Os C,
Android, D Linux understand the

00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:58.699
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:03.974
The question is very specific
mobile operating system.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:07.245
So we're looking for an
OS for phones and tablets.

00:09:07.605 --> 00:09:08.805
Let's go through the list.

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:15.074
Microsoft Windows Option A is mainly
for desktops and laptops, Mac os.

00:09:15.074 --> 00:09:18.795
Option B is for Apple's,
desktop and laptop computers.

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:19.724
Linux.

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:24.525
Option D is a powerful os, mostly
used for servers and desktops,

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:26.175
though Android is based on it.

00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:31.925
But option C, Android is the most
direct and famous example of a mobile

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:34.385
operating system developed by Google.

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:37.235
It's the OS on countless smartphones.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.995
Correct answer C. Thank you.

00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:41.180
See you in the next lecture.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.660
I.
