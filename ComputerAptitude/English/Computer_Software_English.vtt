Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on computer software.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.360
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.390
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.240
So what is this computer software
business at its heart, it's just a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.110
bunch of instructions or programs
that boss the computer around

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.220
telling it exactly what to do.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.035
Imagine the computer's, hardware,
the keyboard, the mouse, the screen

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.924
you're staring at is the body.

00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:32.965
It's the physical stuff, right?

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:37.285
Well, software is the
brain, the mind, the soul.

00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:43.405
Without the software brain, your expensive
computer is just a very complicated,

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.715
very useless box of electronics.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.400
It can't do a single useful thing.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.680
Software is what breeds life into
the machine, making it functional and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.900
allowing us humans to interact with it.

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.089
From everything from writing silly emails
and browsing the internet for cat videos,

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.310
to playing intense games and managing
a country's entire banking system.

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:11.305
Now we generally split this magical
stuff into two main families.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:13.705
First, we have system software.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.145
This is the behind the scenes
manager, the stage crew that makes

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.125
sure the whole show runs smoothly.

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:24.085
It manages the hardware and
provides the basic platform

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:25.675
for other software to run on.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:30.355
Think of things like your operating
system, device drivers, utility

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.085
programs, and even language translators.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.035
Second, we have application software.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:38.165
This is the start of the show.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.765
This is the software you
actually use to get things

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.135
done, to perform specific tasks.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:48.875
This includes your word processors,
web browsers, games, accounting

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.545
software, and fancy graphics editors.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.335
Let's dig a little deeper, shall we?

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:59.795
Operating software or the OS is the
undisputed king of system software.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.625
It's the most critical piece that
manages all the hardware, resources and

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.965
provides services for other programs.

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:11.555
Familiar names here are Windows,
Mac, os, Linux, and Android.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:16.085
Then there's utility software, the
helpful mechanic that keeps your

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:18.215
computer tuned up and optimized.

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:23.615
Your antivirus disc defragment and
backup tools fall into this category.

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.465
Device drivers are like interpreters.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:30.785
They are tiny, but crucial bits
of software that enable hardware

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:34.715
parts like your printer or graphics
card to talk to the operating

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.845
system without the right driver.

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.365
Your printer is just a plastic box.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.890
And language translators like compilers
and interpreters are what Tech Wizards

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.140
use to convert the programming code.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.760
They write into the zeros and ones that
the machine can actually understand.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.260
On the other side of the fence,
we have the applications, general

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.910
purpose applications are the everyday
tools used by almost everyone for

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.160
common tasks, think of Ms. Word.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.400
Excel, Chrome or Gmail.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.150
Then you have specific purpose
applications, which are designed

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.690
for very specialized tasks
in particular industries.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.840
Tally for accounting, Photoshop for
artists, AutoCAD for engineers and complex

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.420
banking software are perfect examples.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.790
Real world relevance.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.280
Now, you might be wondering why should I
care about this as a banking professional,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.489
my friend, understanding computer software
is absolutely vital because it directly

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.170
impacts almost everything in daily
banking, operations, and customer service.

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:45.015
Core banking systems, which are
massive, complex pieces of software,

00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:49.425
manage every single customer
account, transaction, and service.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:53.055
All that money moving around
that software working.

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:53.745
Its magic.

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:58.455
Banks use data analysis software
to crunch numbers on financial

00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:02.390
data, market trends, and customer
behavior to make big decisions.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.710
Cybersecurity tools are the digital
guards essential for protecting

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.430
sensitive financial data and
stopping fraud in its tracks.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
The mobile banking apps and
internet portals you use are powered

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.829
by digital banking platforms,
even for simple office work.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.820
Software like Word processors and
spreadsheets are used constantly

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.840
for reports and documentation,
and to top it all off.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.960
Customer relationship management or CRM
software is used to manage all customer

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.190
interactions and service requests,
ensuring you get the help you need.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.960
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.230
You can expect certain types
of questions on this topic.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.045
The most common format, accounting
for about 40% of questions deals

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:51.925
with definition and classification.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:55.935
They'll ask you for the definition
of software or to classify

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:59.924
examples like whether something
is system or application software.

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:05.534
About 30% of questions will test you
on functionality, asking about the main

00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:10.155
purpose of a specific software type,
like what does an operating system do?

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:15.224
Around 15% will be about identifying
examples of software where

00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:18.405
you'll have to pick out a correct
example for a given category.

00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:23.804
A smaller chunk, about 10% will focus on
the difference between software types,

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:26.414
asking you to compare and contrast them.

00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:32.294
And finally, a tiny 5% might be simple,
basic troubleshooting or scenario

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:36.705
based questions like what software
you would need for a particular task.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.739
Formulas and tricks for this topic.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.370
There are no mathematical formulas
to memorize thank goodness.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.380
Instead, we have some conceptual tricks
or key points to lock in your brain.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.120
First, always remember the difference
between software versus hardware.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.950
Software is intangible.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.960
It's just programs and code.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.549
Hardware is tangible.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.830
It's the physical stuff you can touch.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.330
Software needs, hardware to run and
hardware needs software to be useful.

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.315
Think of system software
as the foundation.

00:06:09.614 --> 00:06:12.255
Remember, S four system S for support.

00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:15.284
It manages the computer's basic resources.

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:20.025
The operating system or OS, is the
most important system software.

00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:21.434
It's the big boss.

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:26.385
The manager like Windows or Android
utility software helps maintain

00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:30.075
and optimize the computer like your
friendly neighborhood antivirus.

00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:34.555
Device drivers are the
diplomats that enable hardware

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.205
to communicate with the os.

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:40.975
Translators like compilers and
interpreters convert human readable

00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:42.955
programming code into machine.

00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:48.385
Understandable code application software
is all about specific tasks for the user.

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:49.255
Remember.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.530
A for application, A for action.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.070
General purpose applications
are for common tasks like

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.050
writing a document in Ms. Word.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.400
While specific purpose applications
are for niche jobs like using

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.140
tally for accounting, there's also
firmware, a special type of software

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.400
permanently embedded in hardware
like the bios acting as a bridge.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.150
And let's not forget the villain
malware, which is malicious

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.460
software like viruses and worms.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.960
Methods of solving.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.650
When a question on computer
software pops up, don't panic.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.900
Just follow these simple steps.

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.570
First, identify the core function.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.859
For any software mentioned, ask
yourself what is its main job.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:36.065
Is it managing the computer's
basic operations, or is it helping

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:37.835
a user do something specific?

00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:41.885
Second, classify by category
based on its function?

00:07:42.005 --> 00:07:45.335
Decide if it's system software
or application software.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:49.295
Third subcategorize, if it's
system software, is it an

00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:51.335
operating system, a utility?

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:54.094
A device driver or a language translator.

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.015
Fourth subcategorize.

00:07:56.015 --> 00:08:00.515
If it's application software, is
it for general everyday use or for

00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:02.465
a specific specialized purpose?

00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:04.805
Fifth, recognize examples.

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:09.094
You must associate common software
names with their correct categories.

00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:13.520
For instance, your brain should
immediately connect Microsoft Word with

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:15.755
application software for word processing.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:20.945
Finally, understand relationships, grasp
how these different types interact.

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:26.784
For example, an application needs the
operating system to run and the OS needs

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.945
device drivers to talk to the hardware.

00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:33.204
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:08:33.444 --> 00:08:35.845
Let's talk about keywords association.

00:08:36.294 --> 00:08:41.605
If you see words like manage control,
resource allocation, booting, or

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:47.030
interface, your mind should immediately
scream system software, especially the os.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:52.380
If you see specific task, user
productivity, entertainment, or

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.189
problem solving, that's a huge
clue for application software.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.900
Words like optimize, protect,
clean or diagnose point

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.204
straight to utility software.

00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:07.615
And if you see convert code or
translate, that's a language translator.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:10.765
Another great trick is
the elimination strategy.

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:14.995
If you're stuck, eliminate the
options you know are definitely wrong.

00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:18.595
This dramatically increases your
chances of getting it right.

00:09:19.314 --> 00:09:21.775
Pay attention to contextual
clues in the question.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:27.085
If it talks about running programs or
managing files, it's likely about the os.

00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:31.795
If it's about creating a presentation,
it's pointing to presentation software.

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:35.065
It also helps to memorize common examples.

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:40.915
Just knowing a few key examples for each
type, like Windows for os ms, office for

00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:45.835
application, and not in for antivirus
can help you answer questions in a flash.

00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:48.725
And never forget the
fundamental definition.

00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:50.824
Software is instructions.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:54.670
If it's not a physical part and
it's giving commands, it's software.

00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:57.705
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.645
Let's clear up some common
B blenders people make.

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:04.665
The number one mistake is
confusing hardware and software.

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:09.975
Remember, hardware you can touch and
probably break software you can only

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.825
curse at another trap is believing.

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:14.835
All programs are applications.

00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:20.145
Many people call everything an app, but
system software is fundamentally different

00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:22.395
and more basic than application software.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.630
Don't underestimate the
role of system software.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.730
Some friends think only applications are
important, but without system software,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.100
your applications can't even start.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.569
A common point of confusion is
misidentifying utility software.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.010
While utilities often come bundled
with an os, they are distinct

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.840
programs designed for maintenance.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.569
People often forget about device drivers.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.660
But these are the unsung heroes of system
software that let your hardware function.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.500
Lastly, don't assume
software is always visible.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:11:00.390
Some software like firmware or
background system processes run

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.849
silently without any user interface.

00:11:04.215 --> 00:11:06.075
W Edge Framework summary.

00:11:06.615 --> 00:11:11.475
So to wrap it all up with a quick
summary, what is computer software?

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:16.095
It's a set of instructions,
data, or programs that enable a

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:18.555
computer to perform specific tasks.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.235
Why is it important?

00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:25.785
It makes the hardware functional, allowing
us to use computers to achieve our goals

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:28.185
instead of using them as door stops.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:29.854
When is it applied?

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:34.954
It's used whenever a computer needs to
do anything from the moment it boots up

00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:37.444
to running the most complex applications.

00:11:37.805 --> 00:11:38.974
Where is it used?

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:44.584
It's in every single computing device
from your PC and smartphone to giant

00:11:44.584 --> 00:11:47.194
servers and embedded systems in your car.

00:11:47.525 --> 00:11:48.435
Who uses it?

00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:53.805
Pretty much everyone, regular users,
programmers, system administrators,

00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:55.695
and entire organizations.

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:57.465
And how is it applied?

00:11:57.795 --> 00:12:02.445
It gets loaded into the computer's
memory and is executed by the processor

00:12:02.565 --> 00:12:04.155
to carry out its defined jobs.

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:07.155
Fully worked out examples.

00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:10.755
All right, let's test our
knowledge with some examples.

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:13.095
Example, one question.

00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:16.545
Which of the following is an
example of system software?

00:12:16.905 --> 00:12:23.625
A, Microsoft Word B, Google Chrome,
C. Windows 10 D, Adobe Photoshop.

00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:26.985
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:33.075
Okay, the question wants us to find
the system software in the list.

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:34.395
Let's break it down.

00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:37.605
System software manages
the computer itself.

00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:42.435
Option a Microsoft Word is for
writing documents, which is a

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:45.105
user task, so it's an application.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:49.935
Option B, Google Chrome is for
browsing the internet, another user

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.455
task, so it's also an application.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:58.880
Option D. Adobe Photoshop is for editing
images, yet another specific user task.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:05.030
So it's an application, but option
C Windows 10 is an operating system.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.830
Its job is to manage the computer's,
resources, and run other programs

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.370
that fits the definition of
system software perfectly.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.810
The correct answer is option
C. Example two question.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.460
What is the primary function of
application software A, to manage

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.140
computer hardware, resources?

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:30.360
B, to provide a platform for system
software C to perform specific

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.950
tasks for the user D to convert high
level language into machine code.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.130
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.530
This one asks for the main
job of application software.

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:45.180
Let's look at the choices.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.370
Option A. Managing hardware resources
is the primary job of the operating

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.410
system, which is system software.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.720
Option B, providing a platform for
system software is completely backward.

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:01.199
System software provides the
platform for applications.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:07.000
Option D converting code is the job of a
language translator, which is a type of

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.970
system software that leaves us with option
C to perform specific tasks for the user.

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:17.980
This is exactly what application software
does, whether it's writing a letter,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.380
balancing a budget, or playing a game.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.670
The correct answer is option
C. Example three question.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.470
Which type of software is responsible
for enabling a printer to communicate

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.880
with the operating system?

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.710
A utility software.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.720
B Application software.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.365
C. Device driver D firmware understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:14:43.604 --> 00:14:47.745
Here we are looking for the software
that acts as a translator between a

00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.324
hardware piece, the printer and the os.

00:14:50.594 --> 00:14:55.245
Let's analyze utility software,
maintains the computer application.

00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:57.165
Software performs user tasks.

00:14:57.435 --> 00:15:01.155
Firmware is low level software
embedded in the hardware itself.

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:05.025
The specific role of enabling
communication between a hardware

00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:09.315
component and the OS is the exact
definition of a device driver.

00:15:09.645 --> 00:15:13.665
Without the printer driver, your
OS wouldn't know how to send data

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:15.585
to your specific model of printer.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.425
The correct answer is option C. Thank you.

00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:20.835
See you in the next lecture.
