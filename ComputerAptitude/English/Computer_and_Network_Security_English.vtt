00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.070
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on computer and network security.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.550
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.600
This is it.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
So what is this big short topic all about?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.990
Simply put, computer and network
security refers to the practices

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.660
and all the fancy technology we use.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.980
To protect our computer systems,
networks, and precious data from any

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.830
unauthorized access, use, or drama.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.510
It's about ensuring the
confidentiality, integrity, and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.820
availability of our information.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.550
Think of it as building a solid digital
fortress around your assets to keep them

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.340
safe from all kinds of digital goons.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.360
Key concepts in computer and
network security include.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.985
First we have confidentiality,
which is just a fancy way of saying

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.875
your information is for your eyes
only, and those you authorize.

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.095
It keeps your secret safe.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:07.255
Then there's integrity, which means
making sure your data is accurate.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.420
And complete, and nobody has
messed with it without permission.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.090
Finally, we have availability.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.560
This means authorized users can get
their data whenever they need it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.960
without any annoying disruptions.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.230
This is the famous CIA Triad
Common Threats and Attacks Now

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.910
for the villains of our story.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:32.615
First up is malware or malicious software.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.875
It's designed to cause damage
or just be plain irritating.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:38.914
We have different types here.

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:41.645
Viruses are like clingy relatives.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:46.295
They attach themselves to legitimate
software and need a host to spread.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.664
Worms are more independent.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.104
They are self-replicating and spread
across networks all by themselves.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.310
No host needed.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.940
Trojan horses are the masters of disguise.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.290
They look like useful software,
but they hide malicious code.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.590
They trick you, but they
don't self-replicate.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.590
Ransomware is the digital kidnapper.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.770
It encrypts your files
and demands A ransom.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.350
Spyware is the neighborhood gossip.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.830
It secretly watches and
collects your information.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.080
Adware is that annoying salesman
who just keeps showing unwanted ads.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.220
And key loggers are the worst
kind of spies, recording

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.200
every single thing you type.

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:34.420
Next is phishing, a social engineering
trick where attackers pretend to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.130
be someone trustworthy, like your
organization, to fool you into giving

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.469
up sensitive info like passwords.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.029
Usually through email.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.010
Then we have spoofing.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.750
This is the art of disguise, faking
communication from a known source.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.490
It can be email spoofing,
IP spoofing, you name it.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.700
It's often the tool used
in a phishing attack.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.900
Imagine a DOS or DDOS attack as creating
a massive traffic jam to make a website

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.720
on network unavailable to its real users.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.310
And finally, unauthorized access is
simply breaking and entering into a system

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.040
without permission, often because of weak
passwords or trickery security measures.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.120
So how do we fight back
with a good firewall?

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:27.375
It's the security guard for your network
monitoring all incoming and outgoing

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:30.045
traffic and blocking anything suspicious.

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:32.715
We also have antivirus software.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:36.855
The police force that detects,
prevents and removes malware.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.810
Encryption is like writing
your data in a secret code.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.060
There's symmetric encryption, which
uses one secret key for both locking

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.240
and unlocking and asymmetric encryption,
which uses a pair of keys, a public key to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.670
lock it, and a private key to unlock it.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.275
Of course you need strong passwords.

00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:59.585
Please know password 1, 2, 3.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:05.195
Use a mix of everything and always keep
your systems and software updated with

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:07.925
regular updates to patch security holes.

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:12.815
Finally, have a good backup and recovery
plan because you never know when you

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.704
might need to restore everything.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:16.415
Real world relevance.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.959
Why does this matter?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.609
For data protection?

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.200
It safeguards customer data and
records for financial security.

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.969
It protects your online money
transactions for operational continuity.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.590
It keeps your systems running for
daily work for reputation management.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.530
It prevents data breaches
that can ruin trust.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.359
It also helps with compliance to
legal rules and with risk mitigation

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.130
to reduce financial losses.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.440
Breakdown of question types.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.730
In your exam.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.210
Questions on this topic
often focus on a few areas.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.580
About 40% will be on terminology
and definitions, asking what things

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.410
like malware or phishing mean.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.090
Around 30% will cover the purpose
of functionality of security

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.430
measures like what a firewall does.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.180
Another 15% will be on T threat
identification and prevention.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.210
Through scenarios, you'll see about 10%
on differences or comparisons like virus

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.900
versus wan, and a small 5% on security,
best practices, formulas, and tricks.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.210
While there are no math formulas, remember
these cheat codes first, the CIA triad

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.570
Confidentiality, integrity, availability
For malware types, a virus needs a host.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.730
A worm wanders on its own.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.410
A Trojan is a trick.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.520
Ransomware.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.020
Once ransom spyware spies
a key logger log skis.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:48.465
Remember, phishing is the act
of deception to get information

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:52.575
while spoofing is faking an
identity often used for phishing.

00:05:52.965 --> 00:05:56.625
A firewall is a gatekeeper
and encryption scrambles.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.844
Data symmetric uses one key.

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:02.505
A symmetric uses two keys,
a public and a private one.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:03.810
Methods of solving.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.985
To tackle questions first, understand
the goal of any security measure

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.745
mentioned, identify the attack vector.

00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.485
How is the attack happening?

00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:15.975
Match the threat to the right solution.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:19.635
Pay close attention to the small
differences between similar

00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:23.385
terms, and always prioritize
fundamental best practices like

00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:28.065
updates, and strong passwords,
shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.830
Here are some quick tricks.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.470
Mal means bad like in malware.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.510
Phishing sounds like fake.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.520
Spoof means impersonate.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.410
A firewall is a wall.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.510
Encrypt is a secret code.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.490
A virus needs a vehicle.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.330
A worm is a wanderer,
and a Trojan is a trick.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.760
Common mistakes and misconceptions don't
make these common mistakes, my friend.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.160
Not all malware is a virus.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.510
Antivirus does not protect against
everything, especially brand new attacks.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.700
Firewalls are not foolproof.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.140
They can be bypassed.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.880
Encryption makes data unreadable,
but the key itself can be stolen.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.860
Phishing isn't just email.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.595
It can be texts or calls and spoofing
while usually malicious in exams.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.920
Can have legitimate uses.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.990
WH framework summary.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.810
So to sum it up, what is it?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.180
Protecting digital stuff from harm.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.860
Why do we do it to ensure the
CIA triad and prevent losses?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.210
When is it applied?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.890
Always continuously.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.390
Where is it implemented?

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.789
Everywhere from your PC to the cloud.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.170
Who is responsible?

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.050
All of us from it pros to every user.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.430
And how is it done?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.229
Through firewalls, antivirus, encryption,
good passwords, updates, and being

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:48.900
aware, fully worked out Examples.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.750
Let's look at example, one question.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.610
Which type of malicious software is
designed to replicate itself and spread

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.719
to other computers across a network
without requiring a host program?

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.240
A virus.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:07.760
B, Trojan horse, C Waam, D
spyware understand the question

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.409
before moving to explanation.

00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:11.570
Okay, let's break it down.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.530
The key phrases are replicate
itself, spread across a network

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.299
and without requiring a host.

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:21.919
A virus needs a host, so A is
out, a Trojan horse doesn't

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.390
replicate, so B is out.

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:26.270
Spyware doesn't focus
on spreading like this.

00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:26.955
So D is out.

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:32.699
A worm is famous for self-replicating and
spreading independently across networks.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.909
It fits perfectly correct answer
C. Here is example two question.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.169
A user receives an email that
appears to be from their official

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.760
organization, asking them to click a
link to update their login credentials.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.120
Due to a security breach.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.560
Upon clicking, they are taken to
a fake website designed to steal

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.180
their username and password.

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:01.790
This is an example of what type of
cyber attack a denial of service.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:08.120
B. Phishing C, ransomware, D
Spoofing understand the question

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:10.010
before moving to explanation.

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:13.454
All right, let's analyze this.

00:09:13.814 --> 00:09:18.314
The attack involves a deceptive
email impersonation and stealing

00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:19.935
credentials on a fake site.

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:24.405
A DOS attack just floods the
system, so A is incorrect.

00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:27.285
Ransomware encrypts files for a ransom.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.840
So C is incorrect.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.910
Spoofing is just faking an identity, which
is part of this attack, but the whole

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.770
scam of tricking the user to get their
information is the definition of phishing.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.930
Phishing is the broader, more accurate
term for the entire attack, correct?

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.535
Answer B. And finally,
example three question.

00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:52.330
What is the primary function of
a firewall in a computer network?

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:56.035
A, to increase the speed
of internet browsing.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:59.395
B, to detect and remove computer viruses.

00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:03.895
C to monitor and control incoming
and outgoing network traffic.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.314
D to store backup copies
of important data.

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:10.795
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.710
This one is straightforward.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.650
The question asks for
the primary function.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.430
A firewall doesn't increase
speed, so A is wrong.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.290
Detecting viruses is the job of
antivirus software, so B is wrong.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.070
Storing backups is for backup
systems, so D is wrong.

00:10:29.665 --> 00:10:31.165
A firewall's main job.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:35.785
Its whole purpose in life is to be
a barrier that monitors and controls

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.575
network traffic based on security rules.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.545
Correct answer C. Thank you.

00:10:41.665 --> 00:10:42.850
See you in the next lecture.
