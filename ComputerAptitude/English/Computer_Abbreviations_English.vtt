00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.470
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on computer abbreviation.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.130
Think of this as a cheat code
for understanding this concept.

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:11.655
Concept, explanation.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:13.545
Re what are these things?

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:18.435
Simply put, computer abbreviations
are the nicknames of the tech world.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:23.564
They are just shortened forms of
long, sometimes complicated words or

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:29.115
phrases used in computing, and it,
they're created to make our lives

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.605
easier and our conversations faster.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.434
Especially when we talk about
all this technical stuff.

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:41.045
For example, instead of saying central
processing unit again and again, like a

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:44.360
stuck record, we just say CPU much better.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:44.599
No.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.730
Real world relevance.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.400
Now, why should you care about this?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
Because my friend, being
proficient in computer aptitude

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.339
is vital in today's world.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.559
Understanding these abbreviations helps
you communicate clearly whether you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.660
are discussing digital systems, network
problems, or even cybersecurity stuff.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.695
It basically enables everyone to
work efficiently and solve problems

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.655
without getting lost in translation.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:19.875
Breakdown of question types based on
the typical patterns in your exam.

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:23.265
Questions on this topic
usually come in two flavors.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:29.354
First, and this is the most common one
with about an 80% frequency, is asking

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:31.395
for the full form of an abbreviation.

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:36.695
They'll give you a short form, say
CPU, and ask you to pick its complete

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.794
expanded name from the options.

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:44.285
The second type, which you'll see about
20% of the time, is the complete opposite.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:49.024
They'll give you the full form,
like worldwide web and ask for its

00:01:49.024 --> 00:01:51.725
correct abbreviation, formulas, and.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.035
Now, there are no magic formulas
for remembering these, but I do

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:58.715
have some clever tricks for you.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.145
First is categorization.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.885
Try grouping the abbreviations by
their category, like putting all

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:10.384
hardware ones together, all software
ones in another list, and so on.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:12.560
It helps to organize your brain.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.989
Next, the good old flashcards
method is fantastic.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.310
Write the abbreviation on one side
and the full form on the other.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.780
You can also create mnemonics,
which are memorable little phrases

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.890
where the first letter of each word
helps you remember the abbreviation.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.760
Of course, regular revision
is the key to success.

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.840
You must review a few
abbreviations daily or weekly.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.930
Finally, try some contextual learning.

00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:45.234
If you understand what the full
term actually means, remembering its

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:46.825
short form becomes a piece of cake.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.695
Methods of solving.

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:53.204
When you see a question on
abbreviations, here is a

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:55.275
step-by-step method to tackle it.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:59.505
First and most importantly,
read the question carefully.

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:04.274
You need to be sure if they're asking
for the full form or the abbreviation.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.910
Next, try to recall the full form
abbreviation from your memory.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.160
Then analyze the options provided,
look at them closely and start

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.200
to eliminate incorrect options.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.490
Many times the wrong options will
have one or two correct words,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.019
but will be wrong over overall.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.590
They are just there to confuse you.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
After you've cleared out the rubbish,
you can select the best fit, which

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.140
will be the option that most accurately
represents the correct answer,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.540
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.110
Looking for some smart
techniques, I've got you covered.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.730
A good trick is to focus on
common prefixes, suffixes.

00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:50.635
Many abbreviations share parts like inter
for internet or OS for operating system.

00:03:51.024 --> 00:03:54.054
Recognizing these patterns
is a great shortcut.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.144
Another simple trick is to sound it out.

00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:01.404
Sometimes just saying the
abbreviation out loud can trigger

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:02.660
your memory of the full name.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.030
You can also use Visual Association
by linking the abbreviation

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.680
to an image or a concept that
relates to its meaning, my friend.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.500
You must also practice with mock tests.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.270
This is the best way to get faster
and more confident for the exam day.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.280
And a pro tip, prioritize
high frequency abbreviations.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.420
Focus on memorizing the most
common ones first as they have

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.530
a higher chance of showing up.

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:34.335
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:38.205
Now let's talk about the
common traps people fall into.

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:42.945
The biggest one is mixing up
similar abbreviations like confusing

00:04:42.945 --> 00:04:45.854
Lan with Van or Ram with rom.

00:04:46.184 --> 00:04:48.554
Be very careful with these lookalikes.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.320
Another silly mistake is getting
the incorrect word order.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.090
You might remember all the right words,
but put them in the wrong sequence.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.830
For example, the full form of
DOS is disc operating system,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.110
not operating system disc.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.890
Also watch out for
ignoring case sensitivity.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.905
While not always tested strictly,
some abbreviations like HTML

00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:14.465
are standard in uppercase.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760
Don't go about adding omitting words from
the full form, just because it sounds

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.369
right, and the biggest mistake of all
is relying solely on rote memorization.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.719
If you don't understand the concept,
you'll forget it very quickly.

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:32.075
WH framework summary.

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:36.605
So to summarize everything in
a nutshell, what are these?

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.695
They are shortened forms
of computer related terms.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:45.185
Why do we use them to make communication
in the tech world efficient and concise?

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:46.625
When are they used?

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:52.235
Oh, all the time in technical documents,
discussions, and of course in exams.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:53.855
Where will you find them?

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:59.255
Everywhere in software, hardware,
networking, and all over the internet.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.675
Who uses them?

00:06:01.034 --> 00:06:05.805
Everyone from computer professionals to
a friend like you, and how do they work

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:10.995
by representing complex terms with fewer
characters for quick and easy reference.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.265
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:16.815
All right, let's solve some examples.

00:06:17.175 --> 00:06:19.215
Example, one question.

00:06:19.485 --> 00:06:22.605
What is the full form of URL options?

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:25.335
A uniform resource locator.

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:30.795
B, universal resource link
C, United Resource Locator.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.195
D. Uniform remote link.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.360
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:41.235
The question wants the full form of URL.

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.455
This is the address of a webpage.

00:06:43.455 --> 00:06:44.895
You type in your browser.

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:46.605
Let's look at the options.

00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:50.895
Universal resource link is
wrong, universal and link

00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:52.425
are not the standard terms.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.785
United Resource locator is also incorrect.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.595
United is not part of it.

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:03.180
And uniform remote link is wrong
because remote link is not standard.

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.930
Option A is the correct and
universally accepted full

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.005
form uniform resource locator.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.390
Example two question.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.800
The abbreviation, RAM stands for
which of the following options?

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:24.090
A. Read access memory B. Random
access module C, random access memory.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.340
D. Read anywhere Memory.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.195
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:35.744
The question asks for the full form
of RAM a type of computer memory.

00:07:36.044 --> 00:07:37.724
Let's evaluate our options.

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:40.364
Read access Memory is incorrect.

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:43.244
Random access module is also wrong.

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:47.054
While RAM is a module, that's
not what the M stands for.

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:48.375
Read anywhere.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.265
Memory is not a standard term.

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:55.364
The correct answer is option C,
random access memory, because

00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:58.875
data can be accessed directly
from any random location.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.620
Example three question.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.380
What does HTTP primarily stand for
in the context of the internet?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.610
Options?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.730
A hyper text transfer protocol.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.610
B, high tech transfer program.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.470
C. Hyperlink.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.390
Text transmission protocol.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.570
D, home text transfer process.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.350
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.720
This question wants the full form of HTTP,
the protocol for transmitting web pages.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.580
Let's check the options.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.610
High tech transfer program is incorrect.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.340
These words are not part of the standard.

00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:46.035
Hyperlink text transmission
protocol is close but wrong.

00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:48.735
Transmission is not the standard word.

00:08:49.064 --> 00:08:52.515
Home text transfer
process is also incorrect.

00:08:52.935 --> 00:08:57.405
The correct answer is option a
hyper text transfer protocol.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:03.075
Hyper text is the content transfer
is moving it, and protocol means

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.515
the rules for that transfer.

00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:05.564
Thank you.

00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:07.245
See you in the next lecture.
