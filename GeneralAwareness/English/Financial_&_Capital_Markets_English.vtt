00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on financial and capital markets.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.000
We are about to make the
complicated, ridiculously clear on

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.350
this concept with this tutorial.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.810
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.270
So what are these financial markets?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.700
Think of them as a massive buzzing
marketplace, a network where people and

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.820
big organizations buy and sell financial
assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.520
It's like a giant pipeline for money.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.410
Moving it from those who have extra
stashed away the savers to those who

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.575
desperately need it, like businesses
wanting to expand or borrowers.

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:43.129
Now within this huge marketplace,
there is a very important

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.019
section called capital Markets.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.290
This part deals only with long-term funds.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.000
We are talking about money that is lent
or invested for more than one year.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.709
The two main stars of this show are
the stock market where company shares

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:01.400
are traded, and the bond market
where debt instruments get traded.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.130
These are absolutely crucial for
businesses to raise big money for

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.240
long-term projects and for governments
to get the funds for their spending.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.730
Now, real world relevance.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.260
Now, why should you even bother
with all this in the banking sector?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.070
Understanding these markets is
vital for managing financial

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.230
products and services effectively.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.779
For your investment decisions, it helps
you assess credit risks and make informed

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:33.910
recommendations to clients that won't come
back to haunt you for client advisory.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.770
This knowledge allows you to advise
clients on investment opportunities based

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.839
on what the market is actually doing.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.000
And finally, for risk management, it
helps you make sound financial decisions

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.470
within the bank by understanding both
market risks and golden opportunities.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.850
Break down off question types based
on patterns we've seen in the exam.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.910
Let's break down the kinds
of questions you can expect.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.040
A huge chunk about 40% will be
simple definition based questions.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
They will just ask for the
definition of terms like stock bond.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.820
IPO or what SEBI and RBI stand for.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.530
Next up, about 25% are function
or role-based questions.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.880
These will ask about the functions
of banks or mutual funds, or the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.980
role of a specific market instrument.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.040
Then 20% are instrument based questions,
making you identify different financial

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.080
instruments and their characteristics.

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:36.084
A smaller 10% are regulatory body
questions, focusing on the powers

00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:40.885
and responsibilities of our market,
guardians, sebi and RBI and a

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.505
tiny 5% might touch upon current
affairs, linking recent market

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.605
developments to these core concepts.

00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:51.084
Formulas and tricks for general awareness.

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:55.015
Our formulas are really just
key definitions and acronyms

00:02:55.015 --> 00:02:56.785
you must burn into your brain.

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:01.375
The capital market deals with
long-term funds like equity and

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:02.875
debt for more than one year.

00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:06.984
The money market is its energetic
cousin dealing with short-term

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.515
funds for less than a year.

00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:12.575
The primary market is where new
securities are issued for the

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:14.855
very first time, like an IPOs.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.625
The secondary market is where these
already existing securities are traded

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:22.355
among investors like on stock exchanges.

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.735
SEBI is the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, the big

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.595
regulator for capital markets.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:33.335
The RBI or Reserve Bank of India
is our central bank regulating

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:34.960
money markets and all of banking.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:38.375
An IPO is an initial public offering.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:44.315
The first time a company offers its
shares to the public, FII or FBI stands

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:48.635
for Foreign Institutional Investor or
Foreign Portfolio Investor, which are

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:54.215
overseas groups investing in our markets
and gex are simply government securities

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.555
bonds issued by the government itself.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.410
Methods of solving.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.410
So how do you tackle
questions on this topic?

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.929
The approach is all about knowledge.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.540
First, understand core definitions.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.070
Make sure you have a perfectly clear
grasp of what each term, like stock

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.440
bond or derivative actually means.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:16.055
Second, identify key functions.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:21.034
You should know the primary roles of
all the players, investors, issuers, and

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:23.855
the regulatory bodies like RBI and sebi.

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:28.235
Third, distinguished market segments
clearly distinguish between the

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.094
money market and capital market.

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.825
Remember their characteristics
and instruments.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.730
Fourth associate instruments with markets.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.290
You must be able to tell which instruments
belong to the money market, like

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.880
commercial paper, and which belong to
the capital market like shares and bonds.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.550
Finally, know your regulatory bodies.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.760
Understand which body governs
which part of the system

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.010
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.350
Let's talk about some smart techniques.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.680
Use acronym association,
for example, think sebi.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.990
S for shares to remember.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.670
It's the capital market regulator
practice keyword spotting in questions.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.150
Look for words like long-term,
short-term or new issue.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.760
To quickly figure out
the concept being tested.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.890
Use the elimination strategy.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.430
If you're stuck, eliminate the
obviously wrong options first.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:22.205
It drastically improves your
chances and always focus on the why.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:25.985
Thinking about why a particular
instrument exists helps you

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:27.665
understand its real purpose.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:30.005
Lastly, use categorization.

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:31.535
Mentally sought everything.

00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:34.955
Money market is short-term,
capital market is long-term.

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:39.365
Primary is for new issues, secondary
is for old or existing ones.

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:41.915
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.675
Be careful to avoid some common traps.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:49.055
A very frequent error is confusing
the money market and capital market.

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:53.345
Just remember, money market is
short-term, capital market is long-term.

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.525
Another is misidentifying
regulatory bodies.

00:05:56.705 --> 00:06:00.065
Please don't attribute capital
market regulation to RBI

00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:01.565
or money markets to sebi.

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:02.600
It's the other way around.

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:06.455
People also mix up the
primary and secondary markets.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:09.005
The primary market is only for new issues.

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:13.955
Also, don't forget the long-term nature
of capital markets, which means funds

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:18.725
for more than one year and never, ever
overlook the basic definitions of terms.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.790
W Edge Framework summary.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.500
Let's do a quick recap.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.140
What are financial and capital markets?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.550
They are systems for trading, financial
assets, and raising long-term capital.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.960
Why do they exist?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.580
They facilitate capital formation,
enable investment, and provide liquidity.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.000
When are they active Continuously
during trading hours.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.010
Where do they operate Globally?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.140
Through exchanges and other platforms.

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.925
Who are the participants,
investors, companies, governments,

00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:48.575
and financial intermediaries.

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:50.164
And how does it all work?

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:53.974
Through the issuance and trading of
instruments like stocks and bonds,

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:59.375
all regulated by bodies like SEBI
and RBI fully worked out examples.

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:01.445
Example, one question.

00:07:01.594 --> 00:07:04.565
Which of the following markets
deals with short-term funds?

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:07.115
Typically for a period
of less than one year?

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:08.635
A capital market.

00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:09.835
B, money market.

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:11.275
C derivatives market.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:12.595
D, commodity market.

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:15.535
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.055
Step one is to analyze the question.

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:21.535
The keywords are short-term
funds and less than one year.

00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:24.055
Step two is to recall definitions.

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:26.455
Capital market is for long-term funds.

00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:28.525
Money market is for short-term funds.

00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:31.765
Derivatives and commodity
markets aren't defined by the

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:33.235
duration of funds in this way.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.750
Step three is matching the definition.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.420
The money market perfectly
fits the description.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.410
So in step four, we select
option B. Example two.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.340
Question, which regulatory body
is primarily responsible for

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.640
the regulation and development
of the capital market in India?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.500
A Reserve Bank of India.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.460
B. Securities and Exchange Board
of India C. Ministry of Finance,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.590
D Indian Banks Association.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.560
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:01.974
Let's break it down.

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:06.414
Step one, the question asks for the
regulator of the capital market in India.

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.424
Step two, recall the roles.

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.695
RBI is the central bank and
regulates money markets.

00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:15.265
SE B's entire purpose is to
regulate the securities market,

00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:16.825
which is the capital market.

00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:21.625
The Ministry of Finance sets policy
but doesn't regulate directly, and the

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:24.414
IBA is an association, not a regulator.

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:29.375
Step three, match the role SE B'S core
job is regulating the capital market.

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:32.555
Therefore, in step four,
the correct choice is B.

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:34.565
Example three question.

00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:38.765
When a company issues its shares to the
public for the very first time, this

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:41.435
process is known as a secondary offering.

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:44.915
B rights issue, CIPO, or D. Bonus issue.

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:47.705
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.270
Okay, step one.

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:53.079
The key phrase here is, for the
very first time, this is critical.

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:56.050
Step two, let's recall
what these terms mean.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.959
A secondary offering is a
sale of existing shares.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.540
A rights issue is for
existing shareholders.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.750
A bonus issue is free shares
for existing shareholders.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:09.454
And initial public offering or IPO
is precisely when a private company

00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:11.285
first offers shares to the public.

00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:15.694
Step three, the description perfectly
matches the definition of an IPO.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:19.895
So for step four, we confidently
select option C. Thank you.

00:09:19.954 --> 00:09:21.395
See you in the next lecture.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.540
I.
