00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.370
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on credit rating and agencies.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.740
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept, explanation.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.130
So what is this credit rating business.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.110
Think of it as a financial kundy
or horoscope for a company, a

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.120
country, or even an individual.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.735
It's an assessment of credit worthiness,
a fancy term for checking how likely

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.955
someone is to pay back their loan.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.245
Can they meet their financial
promises or will they do a

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:35.865
disappearing act with the money?

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:40.725
A credit rating agency is the
pundit G, the company that

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.975
creates this financial horoscope.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.144
They give an independent
opinion, a scorecard on the

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:49.275
financial health of an entity.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.195
Why do all this drama?

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:51.995
Simple.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:57.305
So investors and lenders can make
smart decisions knowing exactly

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.135
how much risk they are taking.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:03.275
It's a financial red flag
or green flag system.

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:05.254
Real world relevance.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.945
Now, this isn't just theory
for your exam, my friend.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:14.289
It's super crucial in the real world,
especially if you land a job in banking.

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:18.965
It directly influences who
gets a loan and who gets up.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:19.475
Polite.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:19.865
No.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.175
Thank you for loan sanctioning.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.054
Banks don't just look
at your charming smile.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:30.395
They look at the credit rating to see
the risk involved in risk management.

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:34.985
These ratings help banks manage
their money smartly so they don't

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.475
put all their eggs in a risky basket.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.800
For treasury folks making
investment decisions, ratings are

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.930
the guide to buying safe bonds.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.700
Banks also need to follow
regulatory compliance where rules

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.710
often demand they check ratings.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.670
A good rating also boosts
a bank's public perception,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.950
making it easier to raise money.

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:01.885
And finally, for interest rate
determination, the rating is king.

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:07.765
It decides the interest rates you see
on loans and even deposits, breakdown

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:12.625
of question types based on what we've
seen in past papers for the exam.

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.655
The questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:19.815
About 40% of the time
you'll get straightforward

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:21.315
definition based questions.

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:26.984
They'll ask you to define credit
rating or some related term, so mugging

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:29.265
up the basic definition is a must.

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:35.894
Then 30% of questions are agency specific,
asking you to identify major players

00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:39.269
like Crystal, SNP, Moody's, or Fitch.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.865
Another 15% focus on.

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:47.605
Purpose or importance questions, basically
asking why do we even have these ratings?

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:53.545
A smaller 10% will be impact or
implication questions like what happens

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:59.665
when a company's rating goes up or down,
and the final 5%, the cherry on top

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:05.275
are regulatory body questions, usually
pointing to our very own city in India.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.329
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.130
Now, for the fun part, in general
awareness formulas are just

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.049
clever ways to remember facts.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.340
First, remember the key global
agencies, the big three.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.200
Just remember the mantra.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.370
SMF.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.190
S and P, Moody's and Fitch for the key
Indian agencies, the mantra is CIC,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.660
crystal, ICR, and care Simple right next.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.340
Understand the rating scale.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.650
It's like school grades, higher grades
like triple A or double A mean lower risk.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.160
These are the class toppers.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.290
Lower grades like C or D, mean
high risk, or that the company has

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.320
already failed to pay D for default.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.640
D for danger.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.225
And don't forget the full
forms, especially sebi.

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:59.665
Securities and Exchange Board
of India the main purpose.

00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:04.165
Just remember that credit ratings
are basically risk assessment

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.495
tools or rats methods of solving.

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:12.235
To tackle questions on this topic,
you need a mix of brains and memory.

00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:15.535
First, conceptual understanding is key.

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:20.130
For definition based questions, you
must understand what credit worthiness

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:22.225
and default risk really mean.

00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:26.945
Second, good old factory call
for agency specific questions.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:30.365
You just have to remember
the names, no way around it.

00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:35.945
Third, apply contextual application
for questions on purpose or impact.

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:38.645
Think like an investor or a banker.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.655
What does a rating mean to them?

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:45.095
Fourth, use the elimination technique
in multiple choice questions.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.565
It's your best friend.

00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:49.805
Get rid of the obviously
silly options first.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.430
Finally practice keyword spotting.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.860
Look for words in the question that
point directly to a concept or an agency.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.150
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be even smarter.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.530
Use acronyms.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.690
If my CIC and SMF didn't click
make your own, they really

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.150
help also try association,
link each agency to a fun fact.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.159
For example, think of SNP and its
famous sovereign ratings for countries.

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.745
Flashcards are not just for kids.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:26.665
They are fantastic for quick revision
of agency names and their main jobs.

00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:31.555
You can also create mind maps, put
credit rating in the center and

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:33.505
draw branches to agency's purpose.

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.405
Impact and regulation.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.815
It helps visualize the topic
and of course, practice quizzes.

00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:44.294
They are the gym for your
brain, showing you where you are

00:05:44.294 --> 00:05:46.094
strong and where you need more.

00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:49.544
Exercise, common mistakes
and misconceptions.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.295
All right, listen up because
many people trip here.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:57.525
First, don't confuse a credit
rating with a credit score.

00:05:57.795 --> 00:06:02.715
A rating is for big entities like
companies, while a score like your civil

00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:05.715
score is for individuals like you and me.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:10.365
Second, please remember that ratings
are opinions, not guarantees.

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:14.675
And triple A rating doesn't
mean the company can never fail.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:16.955
It's just an educated guess.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:19.505
Third, don't ignore the outlook.

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:23.765
A rating often has a positive,
negative or stable outlook.

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:28.355
It's the weather forecast for the rating
telling you where it might go next.

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:33.125
Another common mistake is mixing up
Indian and international agencies.

00:06:33.365 --> 00:06:37.625
Keep the global Big three and the
Indian CIC separate in your head.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.710
Finally, a very common error
is forgetting the regulator.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.180
In India, the boss of all
credit rating agencies is sebi.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.350
Don't forget it.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.580
WH.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.540
Framework summary.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.430
Let's do a quick recap.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.080
So what is it?

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.370
It's an assessment of an entity's
ability to pay back its debt.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.950
And why is it important to help investors
and lenders figure out the risk before

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.510
putting their money on the line?

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.390
When is it used before giving a
loan or for continuous monitoring?

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.460
Where is it used All over the world
in financial markets and banking.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.750
Who is involved?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.010
It's assigned by credit rating
agencies and used by everyone

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.080
from investors to regulators.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.685
And finally.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.740
How is it done By deeply analyzing
financials, management quality and the

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.320
economic situation fully worked out.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.040
Examples.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.440
Okay, time for a little test.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.690
Example, one question.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.790
Which of the following is not one of the
big three global credit rating agencies?

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.480
A mood.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.680
B Crystal.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.530
C Fitch ratings, D Standard and
pos, SNP Understand the question

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.270
before moving to explanation.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.590
Let's solve this.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.520
Step one.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.630
The question wants the odd one out
from the big three global agencies.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.620
Step two.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.080
Now recall our little trick, the SMF
mantra, the big three are standard

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.270
and Poors, Moody's and Fitch.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.820
Step three, let's check the options.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.610
Moody's.

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:11.810
Yes, it's there.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.560
Crystal.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.400
Hmm, that sounds familiar,
but it's an Indian agency.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.120
Fitch?

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.719
Yes.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.159
S and P, yes.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.180
Step four.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.659
So the one that doesn't belong
to the global Big three club

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.940
is crystal easy peasy, right?

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.690
Correct.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.320
Answer Option B. Example two question.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.730
In India, which regulatory body
is primarily responsible for

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.140
regulating credit rating agencies?

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:43.765
A Reserve Bank of India, RBIB,
ministry of Finance, C Securities and

00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:47.095
Exchange Board of India, sebi D TI io.

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:50.575
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:52.855
All right, let's break this down.

00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:57.230
Step one, the question is asking
for the main boss, the regulator

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:59.635
of credit rating agencies in India.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.620
Step two.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.150
Recall the fact we just discussed
in India anything to do with the

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:10.400
securities market, including these
agencies falls under one big watchdog.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.070
Step three, let's look at the options.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.710
RBI handles banks and money policy.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:18.645
Ministry of Finance
handles government's money.

00:09:18.944 --> 00:09:23.954
NTI IO is a think tank that leaves us
with the Securities and Exchange Board

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:28.214
of India sebi, which is the correct
statutory regulator for this job.

00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:29.204
Step four.

00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:34.814
The answer is clearly sebi, correct
answer, option C. Example three.

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:39.955
Question, what is the primary purpose of
a credit rating assigned to a company?

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:42.955
A, to determine the
company's market share.

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:46.855
B, to assess the company's
ability to repay its debts.

00:09:46.975 --> 00:09:51.295
C, to calculate the company's
annual profit D to predict the

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:52.740
company's stock price movement.

00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:56.255
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:58.085
Let's tackle the last one.

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:02.585
Step one, the question wants the
main reason, the primary purpose of

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:04.445
giving a company a credit rating.

00:10:04.595 --> 00:10:08.135
Step two, go back to the
absolute basic definition.

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:09.755
What is a credit rating?

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.065
It's all about credit worthiness.

00:10:12.155 --> 00:10:13.070
And what is that?

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:15.310
The ability to pay back what you owe.

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.175
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:19.615
A market share.

00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:21.415
Nope, that's a sales thing.

00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:23.095
C, annual profit.

00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:26.545
That's just one piece of the
puzzle, not the whole purpose.

00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.615
D, predicting stock price.

00:10:28.735 --> 00:10:30.564
If only it were that simple.

00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:31.525
That leaves.

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:34.525
B, assessing the company's
ability to repay its debts.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.870
This is the very core reason
for a credit ratings existence.
