00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on national events and personalities.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.070
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.000
This is it.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.220
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.490
So what on earth are we talking about?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.870
Let's break it down.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.800
National events are basically
all the significant masala

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.090
happening in our country.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.759
Think of it as the
nation's highlight reel.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420
This includes everything from
the government announcing a new

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
policy, our leaders signing a big
international deal, a landmark

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.755
code judgment that changes lives.

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:35.965
Or even a natural disaster.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.125
It's the entire landscape.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.755
Political, economic, social,
cultural, you name it.

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:43.705
And who are the personalities?

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:44.485
Simple.

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:47.394
They are the lead actors
in this national movie.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.625
These are the prominent individuals
making waves, holding important

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.595
chairs, or grabbing headlines
for their brilliant work.

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:58.315
We are talking about political
leaders, genius scientists.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.570
Amazing artists, champion
Sportspersons, social reformers,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.550
and big shot business tycoons.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.229
Understanding both the events and
the people behind them is absolutely

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.830
crucial for the general awareness
section in your exam as they

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.020
paint the picture of Modern India.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.240
Real world relevance.

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:22.035
Now you might think, why does a
banking officer need to know all this?

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:26.955
Well, staying updated on national events
helps you understand economic shifts

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:29.115
that directly hit the financial world.

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.145
Imagine a new banking
regulation is passed.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.705
You need to be in the know.

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:38.235
Awareness of important personalities
helps in understanding the leadership

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:41.655
and societal forces that shape
the rules you operate under.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.690
For instance, knowledge of major
government schemes like financial

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.290
inclusion programs is vital
for serving customers properly.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.730
Knowing about key appointments and
resignations in government bodies tells

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.800
you about stability and direction.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.060
Recognizing national award winners
gives you a sense of our country's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
achievements and values and those
significant legal judgements.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.460
They can have massive implications for
businesses and the banking industry.

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:13.505
Even knowing about important summits
shows where India stands on global issues,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:15.965
which can influence trade and finance.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:16.745
It's all connected, you see?

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:20.325
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:24.825
All right, let's look at the kind of
questions the exam will throw at you.

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:30.285
Based on past patterns, the most
common type making up about 40 to 45%

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:32.505
are the direct fact-based questions.

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:35.445
These are the nosy auntie
questions of the exam.

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.725
Who, what, when, where.

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:39.345
Pure memory recall.

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:44.865
Next, accounting for 20 to 25% are
awards and honors related questions.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.770
You'll be asked to identify who
won the PADMA Award or which

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.870
sportsperson got a specific honor.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.560
Then we have government schemes
and initiatives, which appear

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.810
about 15 to 20% of the time.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.260
These questions focus on
the goals, beneficiaries, or

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.090
launch dates of major programs.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.810
A smaller chunk around 10
to 15% will be matched.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.500
The following questions you might
have to match events to dates or

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.090
personalities to their fields.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.230
Finally, the.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
Trickiest ones are the statement based
questions at about five to 10% frequency.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.740
These require you to know your
stuff deeply, to figure out which

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.435
statement is correct or incorrect.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.940
Formulas and tricks, formulas
for general awareness.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.250
Don't worry, there's no algebra here.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.380
These are more like clever ard.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220
To help you remember, first
use acronyms and mnemonics.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.925
Create little memorable phrases
for long lists of schemes or names.

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:44.655
Second practice categorization group
information by year or by sector,

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:46.785
like economy, sports, or defense.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.705
This keeps your brain organized.

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:52.395
Third, and this is a big
one, always connect the dots.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.965
Link a person to their biggest
achievement, the event they were

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:57.975
part of, or the award they won.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.315
It makes a stronger memory connection.

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.465
Also learn keyword spotting in a question.

00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:04.520
Words like recently.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.550
First Indian or highest award
are major clues that help

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.930
you narrow down the options.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.440
Flashcards are an old school,
but gold standard method.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.880
And finally, try making mind maps
to visually connect all the related

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:19.185
details for better retention.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.570
Methods of solving.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.750
So how do you actually
solve these questions?

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.950
In the heat of the moment, it's all
about recall and smart strategies.

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.120
The most powerful weapon in your
arsenal is the elimination method.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.630
If you are not sure about the
answer, get rid of the options

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.370
you know are absolutely wrong.

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.049
It's your own KBC style lifeline that
dramatically increases your chances.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.060
Next, use your contextual understanding
even without knowing the exact answer.

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.675
Understanding the time period or
the field in the question can help

00:04:51.675 --> 00:04:53.595
you make a very educated guess.

00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:58.485
Pay very close attention to keywords
in the question like first, latest

00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:01.125
appointed, launched, or specific dates.

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:05.175
The moment you read a question,
practice, recall, and association.

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.745
If you see a name, try to
remember everything associated

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.635
with them for your preparation.

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.105
Prioritization is key.

00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:14.535
Focus on the most recent events.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.730
Say from the last six to 12 months.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.080
For complex statement based questions,
it is vital that you break down each

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.170
statement and check its truthfulness
individually before concluding.

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.719
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.250
To truly ace this section, you
need some smart techniques.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.940
The number one habit is
daily news consumption.

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:41.640
Make a good national newspaper or a
reliable news app your best friend.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.320
It's the most effective way to
stay Current practice focused.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.070
Note taking.

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:49.830
Don't copy paste entire articles.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.169
Just jot down the key facts.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.239
Who, what, when.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:56.445
Where, why, and how?

00:05:56.835 --> 00:06:01.245
General awareness facts have a
tendency to evaporate from our memory.

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:06.615
So regular revision cycles are
non-negotiable, revised daily,

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:10.815
then weekly, then monthly to
really cement the information.

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:12.604
Maintain your own.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:17.555
Who's who and what's new lists
For recent appointments, awards

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:23.075
and schemes, a great trick is to
link current affairs to static gk.

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:28.115
If a place is in the news, look
up its history and geography and

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.575
please practice with mock tests.

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:34.900
This helps with time management and
shows you where your weak spots are.

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:40.265
For less important news, just get
the headline and a one line summary.

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:43.460
Don't get bogged down
in unnecessary details.

00:06:44.984 --> 00:06:47.414
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:51.525
Now let's talk about the
common banana peels that can

00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:53.655
make you slip and lose marks.

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:56.174
A classic one is confusing.

00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:58.005
Similar names or events.

00:06:58.364 --> 00:07:01.905
Always double check the
exact spelling and context.

00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:05.804
Another pitfall is
ignoring dates or years.

00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:10.755
A question might specify a year, and
if you are not paying attention, you'll

00:07:10.755 --> 00:07:12.794
pick an answer from a different time.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.720
Please don't make the mistake of
over-reliance on a single source.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.610
Diversify your new sources to
get a complete unbiased picture.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.360
The biggest blunder is
not revising regularly.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.250
If you don't revise, all your hard
work will just vanish into thin

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.860
air in multiple choice questions.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.610
Sometimes you'll face the
problem of misinterpreting

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.680
the most appropriate option.

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:44.805
More than one option might seem correct,
but you have to choose the one that is

00:07:44.805 --> 00:07:47.085
most accurate for the question asked.

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:51.225
Lastly, avoid focusing
only on glamorous news.

00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:57.015
Yes, politics and sports are important,
but don't ignore significant policy

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:59.295
changes or scientific breakthroughs.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.425
They are equally important.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.409
WH framework summary.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.359
So to wrap up the theory,
let's use a quick WH framework.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.469
What are we dealing with
key events and influential

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:15.510
individuals shaping the nation?

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.219
Why is this important?

00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:21.659
It's essential for understanding
current affairs and national context.

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:23.190
When is this relevant?

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.530
It's an ongoing process covering current
affairs and major historical moments.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.090
Where does this happen?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.230
All across India and at
International Forum where India

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.240
is present, who is involved?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.070
Everyone from government bodies,
prominent citizens to the common public.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.230
And how does all this happen?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.550
Through policy changes, social
movements, economic reforms,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.320
and cultural contributions.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.890
It's the entire story
of our nation in motion.

00:08:53.954 --> 00:08:55.755
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:59.115
Let's put this into practice
with a few examples.

00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:01.425
Example, one question.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:05.625
Who among the following was
recently appointed as the new Chief

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:07.365
election Commissioner of India?

00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:12.885
A. Rajiv Kumar, b Sushil
Chandra, C Om Prakash.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.705
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:22.395
The key word here is new
or recently appointed.

00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:25.605
You need to recall the
latest key appointments.

00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:26.445
Options.

00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:30.735
B, C, and D are all former
chief election commissioners.

00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:35.745
The most recent appointee, and
the current CEC is Rajiv Kumar

00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:37.845
who took over from Su Chandra.

00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:42.900
So the correct answer is
a. Example two question.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.940
The PM Gati Shakti National Master
Plan is primarily aimed at which

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.410
of the following objectives?

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.590
A, providing free
healthcare to all citizens.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.750
B. Developing integrated infrastructure
and multimodal connectivity.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.965
C. Promoting digital
literacy in rural areas.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.330
D, offering skill development
training for unemployed youth.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.340
Understand the question before.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.530
Moving to explanation here.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.220
We need to know the core purpose
of a major government scheme.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.170
Let's analyze the options.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.930
Healthcare is related to Aman Barreth.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.470
Digital literacy is P-M-G-D-I-S-H.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.290
Skill development is P-M-K-V-Y.

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:30.165
The name Gati Shakti itself suggests
speed and power, which aligns perfectly

00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:32.505
with infrastructure and connectivity.

00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:37.155
This plan is indeed a massive
digital platform to coordinate

00:10:37.155 --> 00:10:38.535
infrastructure projects.

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:43.455
Therefore, the correct answer
is B. Example three question.
