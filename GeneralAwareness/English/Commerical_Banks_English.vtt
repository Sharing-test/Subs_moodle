Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on commercial banks.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.220
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:11.715
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.805
So what on earth are commercial banks?

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.955
Think of them as the financial
heart of the country.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:23.445
The big players that deal with you and
me, their main job is wonderfully simple.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.725
They accept deposits from the public.

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:27.314
That's our hard earned money.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.405
And then they provide loans
for all sorts of things.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:34.400
Whether you need a loan for a new
phone, a house, or for your business.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.085
They are the critical link
between people who save money.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.035
And people who need to invest it.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:45.105
Their primary functions involve taking
our deposits in various forms like

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:47.474
savings, current and fixed deposits.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:52.364
Then they advance loans through cash
credits, overdrafts and term loans.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:57.165
They also act like our financial agents
helping with fund transfers and bill

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.595
payments and offer general services.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.099
Like issuing drafts and providing
locker facilities, the whole point

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.150
of their existence, my friend, is to
earn a profit from the gap between the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.620
interest they charge on loans and the
interest they pay us on our deposits.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.460
Simple, right?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.960
Real world relevance.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.760
Now, why should care?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.870
Understanding commercial banks
is absolutely vital for your exam

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.500
because it's the core of the banking
world you'll soon operate in.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.130
It directly impacts the flow
of credit and the financial

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.080
stability of the entire nation.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.150
Your future role will involve applying
these very banking principles, assessing

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.800
who's trustworthy enough for a loan, and
making sure every transaction follows the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.985
rules set within this banking framework.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:49.164
Topics, we will journey through several
key areas, such as how banks manage

00:01:49.164 --> 00:01:53.755
to gather deposits from all of us,
how they decide to debus credit the

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:57.475
complex payment systems that make
our digital transactions possible.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:02.305
The crucial role banks play in financial
inclusion to bring everyone into the

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:06.655
formal economy, how they manage a
mountain of risks every single day.

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:09.685
And of course, the fine
art of customer service.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:15.165
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for the exam.

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:19.125
Questions about commercial banks
tend to follow a predictable recipe.

00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:22.275
About 30% of them are definition based.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:23.295
Simply checking.

00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:27.644
If you know the basic concepts
and functions, roughly 25%.

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:30.644
Focus on the regulatory
framework, which means.

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.665
Questions about the big boss,
the Reserve Bank of India,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.495
and the laws governing banks.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:41.045
You can expect another 20% of questions on
the different kinds of deposits and loans.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.035
Current affairs also make an
appearance with about 15% of

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:49.325
questions related to recent news,
like bank mergers on new policies.

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:54.665
Finally, a small but important 10% will
be about the specific services banks

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:56.880
offer beyond just taking and giving money.

00:02:58.155 --> 00:02:59.475
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:01.575
Don't worry for this topic.

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.635
In general awareness, there
are no terrifying mathematical

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:05.835
formulas to memorize.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:10.695
The tricks are all about understanding
the core ideas and how they connect.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:14.715
The first trick is to always
remember the two primary functions.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.519
Accepting deposits and granting loans.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.390
Almost every other function is
a child of these two parents.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.739
The second trick is a simple
association always link commercial

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.810
banks with the Reserve Bank of India.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.480
The RBI is their ultimate regulator.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.560
For our third trick, you must
clearly differentiate deposit types.

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.595
Demand deposits, like current and
savings accounts offer when you

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.665
need your money on demand time.

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:44.325
Deposits like fixed and recording
deposits offer when you can park your

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:46.484
money for a fixed period to earn more.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.275
And the fourth trick
is to know your loans.

00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:54.105
Understand the basic difference between
short-term credit, like an overdraft and

00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:56.265
long-term facilities like a term loan.

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.815
Methods of solving since this topic
is all conceptual, the methods of

00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:05.505
solving are really just smart ways
to understand and remember all

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:07.005
this information for your exam.

00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:09.644
First, there's the categorization method.

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:13.755
Start by dividing the topic into
broad categories like functions,

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:15.975
types, regulation and products.

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:19.665
Then list and briefly explain
the subpoints under each.

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.855
This helps organize the chaos.

00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:25.275
Another great approach is the
comparative analysis method.

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:27.525
Just pick two related concepts.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.105
Say commercial banks
versus cooperative banks.

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:34.455
Identify key parameters for comparison,
like their objective or target

00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:38.805
customers, and create a mental table to
see the differences and similarities.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.250
This makes distinctions very clear.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.060
Finally, for understanding
processes, you can use the flow

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.710
chart or process mapping method.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.620
Take a process like how
a bank creates credit.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.219
Map out each step sequentially
and understand how each

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.659
step depends on the last.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.150
It's perfect for operational aspects.

00:04:58.155 --> 00:04:59.925
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.175
Let's talk about some smart techniques.

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:06.465
You can create simple acronyms on
mnemonics for primary functions.

00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:08.295
Just think DAL.

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.575
Deposits advances loans.

00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:12.285
It's silly, but it works.

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:16.185
Also, use keyword association
for every concept.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.180
Find one or two core keywords.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:22.395
For example, when you see SLR
in a question, your brain should

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:24.285
immediately scream Liquidity.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.985
CCRR think cash reserve.

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.725
In multiple choice questions,
use the elimination strategy.

00:05:30.905 --> 00:05:34.835
If you are unsure, get rid of the
options that are obviously ridiculous.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.435
This boosts your chances of
guessing correctly, and most

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:40.505
importantly, focus on the why.

00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:45.185
Instead of just memorizing what a
bank does, understand why it does it.

00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:48.215
This deepens your understanding
and makes it stick.

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:51.010
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:54.400
Now, let's address some
common blunders people make.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.479
A classic mistake is confusing
commercial banks with the Central

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.440
bank commercial banks deal with
the public and aim for profit.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.820
The RBI is the regulator and
manager of monetary policy.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.979
Another misconception is believing
banks only lend out existing deposits.

00:06:12.385 --> 00:06:15.925
In reality, commercial banks
create credit through something

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:17.515
called the multiplier effect.

00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:20.875
Also, don't ignore the regulatory aspects.

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:26.425
Many questions come from RBI's role
and banking acts, and please don't

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:30.745
incorrectly assume all your deposits
are fully insured or not know the

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:32.905
actual limit of deposit insurance.

00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:37.045
Lastly, don't underestimate
the general utility functions.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.170
They are just as important
as the primary ones.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.420
WH framework summary.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.870
So to summarize it all
in a neat little package.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.760
What are commercial banks?

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.300
They are financial institutions
that accept deposits and

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.640
provide loans to make a profit.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.320
Why do they exist?

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.180
To fuel economic activity by channeling
savings into productive investments

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.580
and providing us with payment services.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.230
When did they come about?

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:08.175
They've been evolving since the
early days of organized finance.

00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:10.695
Where do they operate globally?

00:07:10.695 --> 00:07:14.295
With a vast network of branches
and digital platforms serving

00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:16.425
everyone who is involved.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:20.445
Individuals, businesses and
governments use their services.

00:07:20.595 --> 00:07:25.005
While central banks like the RBI
regulate them and how do they work

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:29.415
by gathering funds through deposits
and deploying them as loans, earning

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.065
on the interest rate difference.

00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:33.344
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:35.895
Example, one question.

00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:40.335
Which of the following is considered a
primary function of a commercial bank?

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.885
A, issuing currency notes.

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:45.734
B. Acting as a banker to the government.

00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:47.984
C. Accepting deposits.

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.835
D. Controlling credit in the economy.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:54.375
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:55.965
Let's crack this.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:59.775
The question asks for a primary
function of a commercial bank,

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:04.455
option A issuing currency notes is
the job of the central bank, the

00:08:04.455 --> 00:08:07.065
RBI in India, so that's incorrect.

00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:11.984
Option B, acting as a banker to the
government is also an RBI function.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.200
Incorrect Option D. Controlling credit
in the economy through various policy

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.450
tools is again, a core function of
the RBI that leaves us with option C.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.100
Accepting deposits from the public is
the absolute fundamental and primary

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.990
function of any commercial bank.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.670
That's how they get their funds.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.250
So the correct answer is
C. Example two question.

00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:40.469
Which type of deposit account allows for
unlimited transactions and is primarily

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.959
used by businesses for daily operations?

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.300
A savings deposit account.

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:47.339
B, fixed deposit account.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.589
C, recurring deposit account.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.689
D, current deposit account.

00:08:52.285 --> 00:08:55.255
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:56.185
Okay.

00:08:56.365 --> 00:09:00.625
The keywords here are unlimited
transactions and used by businesses.

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:02.245
Let's check the options.

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:07.285
A savings account is for individuals
and has transaction limits, so no.

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:10.885
A fixed deposit account is for
long-term saving and doesn't

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.355
allow frequent transactions.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:17.185
So definitely not a recurring deposit
is for accumulating a lump sum through

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.615
regular deposits, not for daily business.

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:24.090
This leaves option D. The current
deposit account, which is specifically

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.160
designed for businesses, allows unlimited
transactions and usually pays no interest.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.080
It perfectly fits the description.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.460
The correct answer is D
example three question.

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:40.530
The primary regulatory authority for
commercial banks in India is the A,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.449
ministry of Finance, B, securities
and Exchange Board of India, sebi

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:48.120
C, reserve Bank of India, RBI.

00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:53.135
D. Indian Banks Association,
IBA understand the question

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:54.844
before moving to explanation.

00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:55.865
Okay.

00:09:56.135 --> 00:10:00.245
This question wants the primary
regulatory authority for banks in India.

00:10:00.484 --> 00:10:04.505
Let's eliminate the Ministry of
Finance handles fiscal policy,

00:10:04.594 --> 00:10:05.885
not direct bank regulation.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.590
Sebi is the boss of the
stock market, not banks.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.580
The Indian Banks Association is
more of a representative body for

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.680
banks, not a regulator with power.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.640
This leaves us with the undisputed
champion, the Reserve Bank of

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.110
India, the RBI is India's Central
Bank and the primary supervisor

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.950
for all commercial banks, setting
the rules and ensuring stability.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.900
The correct answer is see.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.800
Thank you.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.630
See you in the next lecture.
