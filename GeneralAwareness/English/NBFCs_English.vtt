Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on n BFCs.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.030
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:16.634
Think of a non-banking financial company
or NBFC as a bank's close relative who

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:18.825
didn't get the official family license.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:23.265
They are financial institutions
that offer banking like services,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.244
but aren't full fledged banks.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.675
The Reserve Bank of India, the big
boss, RBI, keeps a close eye on them.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.290
But here's the catch.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.930
They cannot accept demand deposits.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.080
That means no savings or
current accounts for you.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.160
Also, they are not part of the
payment and settlement system.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.600
So what do they do?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.800
They are busy with things like
lending money, investing in shares

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.270
and bonds, higher purchase deals,
leasing and even chip funds.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.970
Real world relevance.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.949
Now, why should you even
bother with these N BFCs?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.570
Well, understanding them is crucial
for anyone dealing with finance.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.759
It helps in checking financial proposals,
figuring out risks, and giving clients

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.470
solid advice on different products.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.620
This knowledge is your secret weapon
for making smart decisions in credit

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.750
management and financial operations.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.300
N BFCs are vital for credit delivery,
often giving loans to sectors that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.950
traditional banks might ignore.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.380
They boost financial inclusion by reaching
people in rural and semi-urban areas.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.785
They also offer specialized services like
infrastructure financing and microfinance.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.860
Plus they give banks a little healthy
competition, which pushes everyone

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.930
to be more innovative and efficient.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.100
And of course, understanding
their regulation by RBI is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.050
non-negotiable for compliance.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.280
All this activity contributes
massively to our overall economy

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.460
growth breakdown of question types.

00:01:57.015 --> 00:02:01.905
For your exam, the questions on n BFCs
generally follow a predictable pattern.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:03.645
Let's look at the blueprint.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:09.945
About 30% of questions are definition
or concept based, like what is an NBFC.

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:15.015
Another 25% of questions will be
difference based pitting n BFCs

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:18.915
against banks asking how they
differ on deposits, for example.

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.570
Regulatory questions make up
around 20% asking things like

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.670
which body regulates n BFCs.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.359
About 15% will be on the types of n BFCs.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.940
And finally, a small but important 10%
will be on current affairs such as recent

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.570
RBI guidelines, formulas, and tricks.

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:42.765
While there are no magical math
formulas here, there are some

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.445
tricks to nail these questions.

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:46.935
Just remember a few key points.

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.585
First the mantra.

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:50.205
No demand deposits.

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:51.105
No checks.

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.415
N BFCs can't take your savings.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.545
Account money and can't issue checks.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:03:00.135
Second, remember, RBI
regulated the Reserve Bank of

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:01.390
India is the one in charge.

00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:06.225
Third, their business must be
financial activities only, not

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:08.505
farming industry or selling goods.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:13.454
A crucial fact to remember is the
minimum NOF or net owned fund,

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:18.225
which for most n BFCs is a need
to Carol Rupi to get registered.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:22.305
Also, remember, they are not
part of the payment system.

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:25.394
And finally, understand
the two main flavors.

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:28.454
They come in deposit taking
and non deposit taking.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.690
Methods of solving.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.110
So how do you solve
questions on this topic?

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.470
First, you must understand
the core definitions.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.530
Get a crystal clear idea of what an NBFC
is, and more importantly, what it is not.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.290
Second, categorize and classify.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.350
Learn the different types
like asset finance company

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.145
or microfinance institution.

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:53.545
Third, identify regulatory asset.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.245
X memorize that.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:59.295
RBI is the regulator and no key
rules like the NOF requirement.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:01.605
Fourth compare and contrast.

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.905
Be ready to explain the
fundamental differences between

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:06.765
N BFCs and commercial banks.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.085
Also, you must stay updated
on recent RBI announcements

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:12.495
for current affairs Questions.

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:17.144
Lastly, analyze their activities to
know what's allowed and what's not.

00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:19.904
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:22.965
For some smart techniques, try keywords.

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:28.455
Association link NBFC with no
demand deposits, RBI and loans.

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:31.905
Use the elimination strategy
in multiple choice questions.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.805
If an option describes a typical
bank function, like accepting

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:37.695
savings, deposits, kick it out.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.295
Focus on the exceptions
that make N BFCs unique.

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.719
You can even create simple
mnemonics if that helps you.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.539
And here's a pro tip for
regulatory questions.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.620
If RBI is an option, it's
almost always the right answer.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.380
Just remember, RBI is the boss.

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:57.405
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.135
Let's clear up some common confusion.

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:02.025
A big mistake is believing.

00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:04.995
N BFCs can accept all deposits wrong.

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:08.505
They cannot accept demand
deposits, though some registered

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.215
ones can take fixed deposits.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.185
Another mistake is
confusing them with banks.

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:17.235
Remember, banks are in the payment
system and offer demand deposits.

00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:19.455
N BFCs are not and do not.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.800
Also don't think all N BFCs can
accept public deposits, only the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.290
special deposit taking MB C scan.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.520
A dangerous mistake is assuming
N BFCs are unregulated.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.190
They are very much regulated by the RBI.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.940
Lastly, people often get the
minimum net owned fund wrong.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.340
For most N BFCs, the magic number is
two carro rupees, not five or 10 Carro.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:45.855
WH framework summary.

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:48.105
Let's summarize this quickly.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:49.095
What are they?

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:52.995
Non-banking, financial companies
offering some banking services

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:54.345
without a full license.

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:55.695
Why do they exist?

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:59.835
To provide credit, promote financial
inclusion, and offer specialized

00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:01.905
services helping the economy grow?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.805
When do they operate All the
time, especially when traditional

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:07.065
banks aren't an option.

00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:11.890
Where do they operate Across India,
especially in rural and semi-urban areas.

00:06:12.604 --> 00:06:13.534
Who uses them?

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:17.614
Everyone from individuals and small
businesses to large corporations.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:18.995
And how do they work?

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:23.135
By lending, investing, and
offering financial products all

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:24.995
under the watchful eye of the RBI.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.630
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.599
Let's try an example question.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.619
Which of the following is a primary
characteristic that distinguishes

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:39.000
a non-banking financial company
or NBFC from a commercial bank In

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.309
India, a n BFCs are regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.090
That is sebi.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.130
BN BFCs can accept demand
deposits from the public.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.450
CN BFCs are not part of the
payment and settlement system.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.350
DN BFCs primarily focus
on agricultural lending.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.380
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.430
All right.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.630
Let's dissect this.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.060
Step one, the question
asks for a key difference.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.560
Option A is wrong.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.350
RBI, not sebi regulates N BFCs.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.360
Option B is a classic trap n BFCs
cannot accept demand deposits.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.620
That's a bank's job.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.390
Option C says N BFCs are not part of
the payment and settlement system.

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:24.750
This is absolutely correct
and a fundamental difference.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.410
Option D is incorrect because while
some n BFCs might do agricultural

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.800
lending, it's not their defining
feature and banks do it too.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.065
So the clear winner is C, correct
answer c. Example two question.

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:44.145
What is the minimum net owned
fund NOF requirement for an

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:47.655
NBFC to obtain registration
from the Reserve Bank of India?

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:54.480
That is RBIA, rupees 50 lack, B one
Carro, C two Carro, D five Carro.

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.570
Understand the question before.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.770
Moving to explanation.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.289
This is a direct recall
question, my friend.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.419
It's asking for the minimum capital.

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:04.010
Let's look at the options.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.440
50 lack and one carro are too low.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.080
Five carro is for other specific entities.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.280
The standard prescribed minimum
net owned fund for most N BFCs to

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.380
get that RBI registration is two.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.000
It's a fact.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.030
You just have to remember
correct answer c.

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:22.755
Example three question.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.805
Which of the following activities
is generally not undertaken by

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:28.635
a non-banking financial company?

00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:32.355
That is N-B-F-C-A, providing
loans and advances.

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:37.934
B, acquisition of shares and
SC, accepting demand deposits, D

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:39.975
leasing, and higher purchase finance.

00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:42.975
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:46.214
The question asks what
an NBFC does not do.

00:08:46.454 --> 00:08:48.525
Let's review providing loans.

00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:49.935
That's their bread and butter.

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:52.814
So A is what they do,
acquisition of shares?

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:53.385
Yes.

00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:55.935
They do that as part of
their investment activities.

00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:59.295
So B is also undertaken
leasing and higher purchase.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:08:59.775
Absolutely.

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:01.880
A very common NBFC service.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.834
So D is also what they do.

00:09:04.194 --> 00:09:07.645
This leaves us with option
C, accepting demand deposits.

00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:09.175
As we've hammered home today.

00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.605
This is the one big thing they cannot do.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.555
It's a bank's exclusive privilege.

00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:16.225
Correct answer C. Thank you.

00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:17.875
See you in the next lecture.
