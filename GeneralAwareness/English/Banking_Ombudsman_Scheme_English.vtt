00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Banking Ombudsman Scheme.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.110
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:10.065
Concept explanation.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.245
So what is this Banking ombudsman scheme?

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.995
Ari, think of it as the friendly
neighborhood, um, empire

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:18.435
for your banking troubles.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:23.115
It's a quick and most importantly,
inexpensive forum for you,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.474
the bank customer, to resolve
complaints about certain services.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.269
It was introduced by our very own
Reserve Bank of India, the RBI, under

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:39.960
the powers given to it by Section 35
A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
Essentially, if you have a grievance
with your bank and they haven't

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.319
solved it properly within a reasonable
time, usually 30 days, you can

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.209
approach the banking ombudsman.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.839
This Ombudsman is an independent
authority who helps get a fair and speedy

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.910
resolution, either through conciliation,
which is just a fancy way of saying a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.430
guided compromise or bypass passing an
award, which is a formal binding decision.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.840
Real world relevance.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.120
Now, why should you care about this
simple Understanding the scheme is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.179
crucial because it's not just some theory.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.230
It directly affects how customer
complaints are handled, which

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.000
is a massive part of banking.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.880
It helps keep customer trust and makes
sure banks are following the RBI's rules.

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.565
This impacts several areas.

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:35.235
It's all about good customer service.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.164
By directly addressing complaints
and ensuring fair treatment.

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:45.015
It ensures regulatory compliance
making banks stick to RBI guidelines.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:50.835
It's a form of risk management because
it helps banks spot recurring problems.

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:55.544
It's vital for reputation management
to maintain a positive image.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.080
It boosts your legal awareness
of the official dispute system.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.370
And finally, understanding the
process helps in operational

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.520
efficiency by improving how
complaints are handled internally.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:13.785
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in the general

00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:15.555
awareness section for your exam.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:20.235
Questions on the banking ombudsman
scheme typically come in a few flavors.

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:25.605
About 30% of questions are definition
purpose-based, asking about the

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:30.225
main objective, who introduced
it, or the act it operates under.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.800
Then about 25% are jurisdiction
scope based questions, which test you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.150
on, what complaints are covered, or
which banks fall under the scheme.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.250
Roughly 20% are process, procedure
based questions, focusing on time

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.360
limits for filing complaints or
the maximum compensation amount.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.460
Around 15% are about key provisions,
amendments, looking at specific

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.230
clauses or recent changes.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.710
And the final 10% are role
function based questions, which

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.810
ask about the ombudsman's powers.

00:03:03.644 --> 00:03:04.994
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:08.954
While there are no magical
formulas, here are the key facts

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.785
you must tattoo onto your brain.

00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.415
The RBI introduced and
operates the scheme.

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:20.054
The legal basis is Section 35 A of
the Banking Regulation Act 1949.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.220
The bank gets a 30 day
time limit to respond.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.560
Before you can approach the ombudsman,
you have one year plus 30 days from

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.540
the issue date to file your complaint.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.270
The maximum compensation for direct
loss is a cool 20 lack while for mental

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.790
agony and harassment, it is one lack.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.230
The methods of resolution are
either conciliation or an award.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.300
If you are still not satisfied.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.110
The appellate authority is a
deputy governor of the RBI.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:53.435
The current scheme is called
the Integrated Scheme,

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.715
which was launched in 2021.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.609
Methods of solving to
grasp its functioning.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.130
Just follow this step-by-step approach.

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:07.530
First, you must understand the grievance
and identify the nature of your complaint.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.149
Second, remember the initial
bank approach as you must contact

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.920
your bank first for resolution.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.510
Third note, the mandatory time
limit for bank, which is that 30 day

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.370
waiting period for their response.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.150
Fourth, understand the Ombudsman's
role as an independent decision maker.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.560
Fifth, know the complaint filing
method and its specific timeframe.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.969
Sixth, be aware that the
resolution process can be a mutual

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.890
agreement or a formal award.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.540
Lastly, recognize the appeal mechanism,
knowing there is a provision to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.400
appeal the Ombudsman's decision.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.590
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some shortcuts.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.570
Of course, you do use this
acronym R-B-I-B-O 35 A, which

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.250
stands for RBI manages Banking
Ombudsman under section 35 A.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.110
For the numbers, just chant
this mantra 31 Y 20 L one.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.740
That's 30 days for the bank's response.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.420
One year to file your complaint.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.450
20. Lack for direct loss
and one lack for all that.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.460
Mental agony for keywords.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.070
Just associate ombudsman with grievance.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.360
Re RBI, customer protection
and independent authority.

00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:22.675
And it helps to mentally picture the
complaint journey as a flow chart Customer

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:26.755
goes to the bank, then to the ombudsman,
and then to the upper late authority.

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:31.405
Always focus on exceptions like
what you cannot complain about, such

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:33.295
as a bank's commercial decisions.

00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:36.195
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:38.295
Let's clear up some common myths.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.825
First mistake believing the ombudsman
is only for public sector banks.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:47.655
Wrong the scheme covers all scheduled
commercial banks, regional rural banks,

00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:49.875
and scheduled primary cooperative banks.

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:51.075
Second mistake.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.745
Thinking you can directly
approach the ombudsman.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:54.795
No, you cannot.

00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:58.785
It is mandatory to complain to
the bank first and wait 30 days.

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.025
Third mistake, confusing
the compensation amounts.

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:07.364
Remember it is 20 lack for direct loss,
but only one lack for mental harassment.

00:06:07.664 --> 00:06:08.565
Fourth mistake.

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:13.575
Assuming all banking issues are covered,
Nope, only specific services are covered.

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:15.674
Commercial decisions are excluded.

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:20.655
Fifth mistake believing the ombudsman's
decision is final Correction, there

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:25.034
is an upper authority, the deputy
governor of RBI where you can appeal.

00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:27.765
WH framework summary.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:30.795
So to summarize it all, what is it?

00:06:31.035 --> 00:06:34.335
An independent cost-free
forum for resolving customer

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:35.835
complaints against banks.

00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:41.085
Why does it exist to provide an accessible
and speedy grievance redress mechanism?

00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:42.405
When is it applied?

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:45.885
When a bank fails to resolve
a complaint within 30 days or

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:48.075
rejects it, where are the offices?

00:06:48.255 --> 00:06:51.855
They are located across India,
mostly in state capitals.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.740
Who is involved bank customers with
grievances and the banking ombudsman

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.930
appointed by the RBI and how does it
work through conciliation or bypassing an

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.240
award after investigating the complaint.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.690
Fully worked out Examples.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.820
Example, one question under which
section of the Banking Regulation Act

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.070
1949 was the Banking Ombudsman scheme
introduced by the Reserve Bank of India,

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:26.405
a section 45 BB section 35 a C section
26 a. D, section 51 C understand the

00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:28.445
question before moving to explanation.

00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:31.685
The question asks for the
specific legal section.

00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:34.205
This is a pure recall question, my friend.

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:38.495
The scheme is a regulatory
initiative by the RBI established

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:42.695
under the powers granted by the
Banking Regulation Act 1949.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:46.715
The specific section that empowers
the RBI to issue these kinds

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:50.855
of directions is section 35 A,
matching this with the options.

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.895
Option B is our correct answer.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.590
Example two question.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.700
What is the maximum amount of
compensation that can be awarded by the

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.230
banking ombudsman for any direct loss
suffered by the complainant as a result

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.300
of the act or omission of the bank?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.040
A one LAC rupees.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.780
B five LAC Rupees.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.180
C 10 LAC Rupees, D 20 Lac Rupe.

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:14.465
Understand the question before.

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:19.475
Moving to explanation here, you need to
identify the key information requested.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:22.895
The question is specifically
about the direct loss suffered.

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:27.095
It's important not to confuse this
with compensation for mental agony.

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:31.715
The scheme has different maximum limits
for different claims for direct loss.

00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:36.275
As per the scheme, the maximum
compensation is a handsome 20 Rees.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:39.095
Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.760
Example three question.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.330
A customer has a complaint
against their bank according to

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.920
the banking ombudsman scheme.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.770
What is the first step the
customer must take before

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.449
approaching the banking ombudsman?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.780
A file a direct complaint with
the Reserve Bank of India.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.410
B.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.790
Approach a consumer court, c. Lodge a
complaint with the bank concerned and

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.860
wait for their response or for 30 days.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.110
D. Consult a legal advisor.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.080
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:09.805
This question is about
the initial procedure.

00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:14.005
The ombudsman scheme is an escalation
mechanism, not the first stop.

00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:17.245
The primary responsibility
lies with the bank itself.

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:20.725
The scheme mandates that a
customer must first approach

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.314
their own bank with the complaint.

00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:26.245
Only if the bank fails to
respond within 30 days, or if

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:27.775
the response is not good enough.

00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:31.825
Can the customer then go to the
ombudsman based on this procedure?

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:34.105
Option C is the correct first step.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:35.550
Thank you.

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:37.290
See you in the next lecture.
