00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on banking terms.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.150
Explanation.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.570
So what are these fancy banking terms
are a, think of them as the secret

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.490
language of the financial world, the
ABCs of how our money moves around.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.905
They are the special words and phrases
used to describe everything in banking.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.185
From operations to policies for a
friend with no prior knowledge, they are

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:39.945
essential to understand how a simple loan
works, how banks actually function, and

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.705
even how the entire economy is managed.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:47.325
Mastering them helps us decode
everything from our loan statements

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:52.695
to how the central bank fights
inflation, real world relevance.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:55.125
Now, why should you care?

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.595
Let's get practical.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:01.724
Knowing the repo rate helps a banking
professional understand how the big

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:06.615
boss, the Reserve Bank controls the
cost of borrowing for all other banks.

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:12.045
This directly affects the interest rates
on loans for customers like you and me.

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:15.405
It's vital knowledge for
giving advice on loans.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.220
Then there's the infamous
non-performing asset, or NPA Spotting.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.740
An NPA is crucial for a bank employee
to identify loans that have gone bad.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.350
You know, the ones not getting repaid.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.010
This directly impacts the bank's health
and risk management, KYC or know your

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:38.560
customer is not just about paperwork.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.630
It's about verifying identities to stop
financial fraud and money laundering.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.485
A fundamental part of a banker's job
in compliance cash reserve ratio or CRR

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.270
helps a banker understand the slice of
deposits that must be parked with the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.500
central bank, which in turn affects
how much money is left to lend out.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.660
And what about any FT slash rtgs?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.820
Being familiar with these allows bank
staff to guide customers on the best

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.009
ways to transfer money electronically.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
Making short transactions
are smooth and timely.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.800
It's all about good customer service.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.810
Finally, inflation.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.865
Understanding inflation helps banking
professionals see how the purchasing

00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:28.185
power of money is shrinking, which
is a huge factor in setting interest

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:30.375
rates and giving investment advice.

00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:32.115
It impacts everything.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.204
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.310
Based on past patterns for your exam.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.150
Questions on banking terms
usually come in a few flavors.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.040
About 40% of the time you'll get
definition based questions, which

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200
directly ask for the meaning of a term.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.425
For instance, what is the
main purpose of the CRR?

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.500
Next, with the frequency of about
25% are full forms and abbreviations.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.910
A classic example is what
does MSF stand for in banking?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.000
Then about 20% of questions
are application based.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.740
These test, if you understand the
effect of a policy, like if the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.910
RBI increases the repo rate, what
happens to bank lending rates?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.109
A smaller chunk, about 10%
are distinction questions.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.980
Asking for the difference
between similar terms like repo

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.839
rate versus reverse repo rate.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.920
And finally, about 5% are
related to current affairs.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.160
Asking about recent policy changes or
current rates, formulas and tricks.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.399
Don't worry, there's no complex math here.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.329
The formulas are just simple
brain hacks for quick recall,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.670
for repo versus reverse repo.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.329
Just remember repo is when
banks borrow from RBI.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.140
Think of reverse repo as the opposite.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.750
The RBI takes money from banks.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.580
It's the reverse of a normal
loan for CRR versus SLR.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
Remember, CRR is cash with
RBI, which earns no interest.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.020
SLR is self liquid reserves, which the
bank holds itself in liquid forms like

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.180
cash, gold or approved securities.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.149
And for the simple ones, NPM means a
non-performing asset, a loan that's gone

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.930
bad and KYC is simply know your customer.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.200
Easy peasy methods of solving.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.910
To solve questions on these
terms, you need a solid game plan.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.570
First, understand the core
definition, what is its

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.580
fundamental meaning and purpose?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.420
Second, identify the key
players who is involved.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.210
RBI, commercial banks or customers.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.580
Third, recognize the mechanism.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.250
Is it a rate, a ratio, a policy?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.420
How does it work?

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.700
Fourth, a certainty impact.

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:54.065
What are the consequences of
a change in this term on the

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:55.985
banking system or the economy?

00:04:56.315 --> 00:04:57.935
Fifth, contextualize it.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.385
How does this term relate
to other financial concepts?

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:05.945
When you get to the multiple choice
options, analyze them carefully and

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:10.835
eliminate the ones that are obviously
wrong and always, always focus on

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:15.544
keywords in the question like increase,
decrease, or primary objective

00:05:16.835 --> 00:05:18.695
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.070
All right.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.500
Now for the juicy part, the shortcuts,
the jugar for your Brain Use acronym

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.690
association to remember full forms.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.060
For example, any FD is not exactly
fast time, but still quick.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.740
It's silly, but it works.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.010
Learn opposite best together like repo and
reverse repo or inflation and deflation.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.350
Focus on their contrasting effects.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.670
Use role-based memory associate
terms with who is responsible.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.090
RBI handles repo CRR and SLR.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.350
Commercial banks deal with NPAs
and loans and of course the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.210
classic elimination strategy.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.470
If you are stuck, try to eliminate
the two most unlikely options.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.480
First, it doubles your chances.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.000
Finally, always keep a current affairs
link for terms like repo rate or SLR.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.030
Keep an eye on recent RBI announcements
as these are hot topics, common

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.920
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.710
Now let's look at the banana peels.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.990
Everyone slips on a common mistake is
confusing repo rate and reverse repo rate.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.760
The correction is simple.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.460
Repo rate is when banks borrow from RBI.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.640
Reverse.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.790
Repo rate is when banks lent to RBI.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.130
Another one is misunderstanding.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.555
CRR versus SLR.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.300
Remember, CRR is cash held with RBI.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.670
While SLR is liquid assets held
by the bank itself, people also

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.640
incorrectly identify an NPA thinking.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.020
Any delay makes a loan.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.340
An NPA, the correction is that
a loan typically becomes an NPA

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.590
after 90 days of non-payment.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.200
A big mistake is ignoring the why.

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.110
Don't just memorize definitions,
understand their purpose.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.599
Always ask why is this important?

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.830
Lastly, be careful not to
overlook nuances and definitions.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.180
Pay close attention to the specific
keywords that differentiate similar

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.000
sounding terms, WH framework summary.

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:22.485
So to summarize it all nicely,
what are banking terms?

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:26.354
They are the specialized
vocabulary of the financial sector.

00:07:26.715 --> 00:07:28.005
Why are they important?

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:31.844
They are essential for clear
communication, managing risk,

00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:33.435
and understanding policy.

00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:37.724
When are they used daily in
banking, operations, financial

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.495
news, and policy discussions.

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:40.815
Where are they used?

00:07:41.115 --> 00:07:45.255
Primarily in commercial banks,
central banks, and financial markets.

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:46.195
Who uses them?

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:50.705
Bankers, analysts, economists,
and basically anyone dealing with

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:54.995
money, and how do we understand them
through their definitions, practical

00:07:54.995 --> 00:08:00.815
applications and their impact on
the economy worked out Examples.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.090
Let's try a few questions.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.310
Example one question.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.630
Which of the following terms refers
to the rate at which commercial banks

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.040
borrow money from the Reserve Bank
of India, RBI, by selling government

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.940
securities with an agreement to
repurchase them at a later date.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.725
A reverse repo rate.

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:20.925
B repo.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.690
C. Bank rate D. Marginal
standing facility.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.770
MSF understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.710
All right, let's break this down.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.580
The question asks for the rate at
which commercial banks borrow from

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.250
the RBI using a repurchase agreement.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.610
The key word is borrow money from the
RBI reverse repo is when RBI borrows bank

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.620
rate is for lending without collateral.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.690
MSF is for emergencies.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.890
The description perfectly matches
the definition of repo rate, which

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.690
stands for repurchase option.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.145
So the correct option is
B. Example two question.

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:04.215
What does the acronym NPA stand for
in the context of banking and finance?

00:09:04.215 --> 00:09:06.255
A national payment account?

00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:10.785
B, non-performing asset
C. New policy agreement D.

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:12.255
Net profit analysis.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.150
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:19.125
This one is a straightforward,
full form question.

00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:22.815
In banking, NPA is a very
common term for a bad loan.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:27.585
The correct expansion is non-performing
asset, which refers to a loan where

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.625
payments are overdue for 90 days.

00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:32.205
The other options are just distractors.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.905
Therefore, option B is the right answer.

00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:37.005
Example three question.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.960
If the Reserve Bank of India, RBI
decides to increase the cash reserve

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.090
ratio, CRR, what is the most likely
immediate impact on the commercial banks?

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.820
A. Their lending capacity will increase.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.640
B. Their lending capacity will decrease.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.880
B, the interest rates on
deposits will increase.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.790
D. The interest rates
on loans will decrease.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.970
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.230
Let's analyze this.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.065
The question asks about the impact
of an increase in C-R-R-C-R-R

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.960
is the portion of deposits that
banks must keep with the RBI.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.610
If this ratio increases, banks have
to park more money with the RBI.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.690
This leaves them with less money
to lend out to customers, so their

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.520
lending capacity will decrease.

00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:26.495
Looking at the options, A is the opposite.

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.735
C and D are not direct
or immediate impacts.

00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:34.595
A decrease in lending capacity might
even push loan rates up not down.

00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:37.955
So the most logical and
correct answer is B.

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:40.595
Thank you C you in the next lecture.
