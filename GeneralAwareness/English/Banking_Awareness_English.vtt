Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on banking awareness.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.550
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.059
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.719
So what is this big deal
about banking awareness.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.130
Think of it as knowing the secret
handshake of the financial world.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.490
It's the complete lowdown
on the banking system.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.840
Its functions, all the fancy
terms, the rules of the game, and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.790
the entire financial playground.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.560
For anyone dreaming of a career in
banking, this knowledge is not just

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.720
important, it's your superpower.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:40.775
It helps you understand how these
money temples operate, their

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:45.095
massive role in our economy and
the basket of goodies, financial

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:46.775
products and services they offer.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.140
Let's start with the big boss,
the Reserve Bank of India,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.740
RBI established back in 1935.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.810
This is India Central Bank.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.730
It's the headmaster that regulates
the entire banking system, the one

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.360
that prints our currency, manages
our foreign money piggy bank,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.280
and cooks up the monetary policy.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.740
We often call it the banker's
bank because it's the bank

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.600
where other banks go to bank.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.370
And the government's bank, because
it handles the government's finances,

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.530
quite the multitasker, isn't it?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.620
Now let's talk about the types of banks.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.550
You have your popular commercial
banks that take our deposits

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.630
and give loans to everyone from
the public to big businesses.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.690
These include popular sector giants
like SBI and PNB, slick private sector

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.390
players like HDFC and I-C-I-C-I Bank,
and even foreign banks like Citibank.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.890
Then there are cooperative banks,
which are like a close-knit family,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.540
organized on a cooperative basis to
serve their own members in specific

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.880
communities to serve our villages.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
We have regional rural banks, rbs,
bringing basic banking to the countryside.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.929
We also have the specialized small
finance banks, sbs, which focus on

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.520
helping the unserved and underserved
folks, small businesses, marginal

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.010
farmers, and the unorganized sector.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
Finally, there are the new age
payments banks, which can accept

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
deposits up to a certain limit and
handle payments, but they can't give

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.210
you loans or credit cards, sorry,
no shopping sprees on their account.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:33.315
Next up is the RBI's magic
wand, the monetary policy.

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.755
This is basically the set of
tools RBI uses to control the

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:41.805
money supply, how easily you can
get credit and interest rates.

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:46.515
All this is to achieve big economic
goals like keeping prices stable

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.495
and helping the economy grow.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:53.495
The key tools in this magical toolkit
include the repo rate, which is the

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:58.084
interest rate at which commercial banks
borrow short-term money from the RBI.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.285
The opposite of this is the
reverse repo rate, the rate at

00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:04.325
which RBI borrows from the banks.

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:06.905
Then there's the cash reserve ratios.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.030
CRRA certain percentage of a
bank's total deposits that it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.519
must park with the RBI AS cash.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.130
Similarly, the statutory liquidity
ratio SLR is the percentage of deposits

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.929
a bank must maintain in liquid assets
like gold or government securities.

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:29.035
The bank rate is the rate at which
RBI lends to commercial banks without

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:31.495
any collateral for emergencies.

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:36.535
There's the marginal standing facility
MSF, where banks can borrow overnight from

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.115
the RBI against government securities.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:44.785
And finally, open market operations,
OMO, which is just the RBI buying or

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:48.835
selling government securities in the
open market to manage the money supply.

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:53.175
Let's quickly touch upon
some financial instruments.

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:57.015
The tools of the trade, the classic
check is a written order to your

00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:59.655
bank to pay someone a demand draft.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:04.665
DD is a most secure version issued by
the bank itself, a guaranteed payment

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.485
that can't bounds for digital transfers.

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:12.975
We have RTGS time cross settlement,
a super fast system for large

00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:16.635
value transactions that happen
instantly and individually.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:21.185
Then there's any FD National
Electronic Funds transfer, which

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.745
processes transactions in convenient
batches for instant gratification.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:30.485
We have IMPS Immediate Payment Service,
a twenty four seven service through

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:33.245
mobile phones and the king of them all.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:38.735
UPI Unified Payment System, a system
that connects all your bank accounts into

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.135
one mobile app for seamless payments.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.315
And of course we have
some key banking terms.

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:49.965
An NPA non-performing asset is
a loan that has gone bad where

00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:52.065
payments are overdue for 90 days.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.885
Think of it like a loan
that ghosted the bank.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:59.145
Basal norms are the international
rule book for banks to ensure

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:00.645
they are strong and stable.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:05.955
KYC Know your customer is the process
where banks verify your identity,

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:10.800
basically making sure you are who you
say you are to prevent shady activities.

00:05:11.525 --> 00:05:15.245
Inflation is when prices rise
and your money buys less,

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:16.805
your wallet feels lighter.

00:05:17.255 --> 00:05:18.875
Deflation is the opposite.

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:24.155
A general fall in prices and financial
inclusion is the noble goal of

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:28.115
making sure everyone, especially
the weaker sections, has access

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:30.065
to affordable financial services.

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:32.594
Real world relevance.

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:35.715
Now, you might wonder
why bother with on this?

00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:40.005
Understanding banking awareness is
absolutely crucial for a specialist

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:44.115
officer because it's the foundation
for smart decision making and

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:45.735
solving problems in the bank.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.440
It helps you master the complex world
of financial rules, customer demands,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.140
and market trends specific to your job.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.160
It leads to enhanced decision
making, operational excellence,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.670
a better market understanding,
and superb customer relations.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:06.615
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:08.685
The questions are usually a mix.

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:13.365
About 30% are direct factual
questions asking for facts or dates

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:15.825
like When was RBI nationalized?

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:20.775
Around 25% are on full forms
or abbreviations asking what

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.845
something like MCLR stands for.

00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:26.565
20% deal with functions
and roles, questioning the

00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:28.575
responsibilities of different bodies.

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:33.784
15% are on current banking affairs,
covering recent policies or schemes.

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:38.854
A small 5% might be on banking
history and evolution, and another

00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:41.825
5% on financial terms and concepts.

00:06:41.974 --> 00:06:45.065
Testing your understanding of
terms like moral persuasion.

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:47.655
Formulas and tricks.

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:52.545
Look, banking awareness is mostly
about memory, not math, but here are

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:57.855
some tricks to help you use acronyms
and mes for monetary policy tools.

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:04.845
You can use the phrase, can Sara really
ride my big old bike for C-R-R-S-L-R repo?

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:07.710
Reverse repo MSF bank rate and OMO.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:12.305
Use timeline association by
linking historical banking dates

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:14.345
to major events you already know.

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:18.755
Try categorization by grouping
similar terms like all payment

00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:20.645
systems to see their differences.

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:25.115
Flashcards are your best friend for
quick revision of facts and full forms.

00:07:25.475 --> 00:07:28.685
Mind maps can help you visually
connect different concepts.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:33.160
And my favorite, the What's the
difference approach for confusing

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.495
pairs, like repo versus reverse repo.

00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:37.775
Just list out what makes them different.

00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:43.935
Methods of solving To tackle these
questions, you need a mix of skills

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:48.195
For factual recall questions,
you just have to know the answer,

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.385
which means lots of revision.

00:07:50.835 --> 00:07:54.765
For conceptual understanding
questions, you need to grasp the

00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:57.345
core idea behind a term or scenario.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:01.485
If you are stuck, the elimination
method is your lifeline.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.155
Get rid of the obviously wrong answers.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.625
To improve your odds.

00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:09.975
Always practice keyword
identification in long questions.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.885
To find clues that point
to the right concept.

00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:17.955
Use current affairs linkage to connect
recent news to static knowledge.

00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:22.425
And finally, for situation
based questions, use contextual.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.120
To figure out the most fitting
answer, shortcuts and smart

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.560
techniques to be a champion in this
section, you need to work smart.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.870
Prioritize high frequency topics like
RBI functions and monetary policy

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.939
tools because they show up a lot.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.910
Spend 15 to 20 minutes on a daily current
affairs review, especially financial news.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.070
After every mock test, do a thorough
mock test analysis to understand your

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.290
mistakes and revise those topics.

00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:54.760
Group study can be a game changer.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.130
Quizzing each other really helps create
your own notes by condensing information.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.710
The act of writing itself aids memory
and please practice full forms regularly.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.795
They are easy marks for the taking
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.290
Let's talk about the common
traps First is confusing.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.060
Similar terms, my friend.

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:21.069
Please don't mix up repo rate and reverse
repo rate focus on their core purpose.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.520
A big mistake is ignoring
current banking affairs.

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:27.699
The exam loves questions
linked to recent events.

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:30.705
Another trap is not understanding the why.

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:33.675
Just memorizing definitions is not enough.

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:38.895
Knowing why a policy exists helps you
answer tricky application based questions.

00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:44.355
Also, don't overlook historical milestones
like bank nationalization dates.

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:48.765
And finally, please don't get mixed
up with misinterpreting economic

00:09:48.765 --> 00:09:51.525
indicators like inflation and deflation.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.895
They have very distinct
meanings and impacts.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.390
WH framework summary.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.140
So to wrap it all up in a
neat package, what is it?

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.570
Knowledge of India's banking system.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.920
Why is it important?

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.210
It's essential for doing your job
well and understanding the economy.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.530
When is it applied?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.310
Every day when dealing with
money, policies and customers.

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:17.515
Where is it relevant in all
banks, regulatory bodies, and

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:19.285
even in your personal finance?

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:20.305
Who needs it?

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:24.805
Bank, employees, customers,
policy makers, basically everyone.

00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:29.454
And how is it understood by studying
its concepts, history and keeping

00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:31.735
up with the news fully worked out?

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:32.485
Examples?

00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:34.105
Let's try an example.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.290
Example, one question.

00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:39.770
What is the primary function
of the Reserve Bank of India?

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.490
RBIA, accepting deposits from the public.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.579
B, providing long-term
loans to industries.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.209
C. Issuing currency and
regulating monetary policy.

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:53.089
D. Managing the stock market operations.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.180
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.959
All right.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.605
The question asks for
the main job of the RBI.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.469
Let's look at the options.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.740
Option A accepting
public deposits is what?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.819
Commercial banks like.

00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:10.980
SBI do option B giving long-term
loans to industries is also a job

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.750
for commercial banks, not the RBI
option D. Managing the stock market

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.074
is the job of SEBI, not the RB.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.720
That leaves us with option C.
Issuing currency and regulating

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.380
monetary policy are the two biggest
responsibilities of the RBI.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:33.370
It's their core business, so the answer is
clearly C, answer C. Example two question.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.570
Which of the following digital payment
systems, processes transactions in

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.880
batches and is available round the clock.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.260
A-R-T-G-S.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.000
B-N-E-F-T-C-I-M-P-S-D-U-P.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.209
I understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.100
Okay, let's break this down.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.970
The keywords here are processes,
transactions in batches, and

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.350
available round the clock.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.819
Let's check out options.

00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:04.025
RTGS is realtime, not batch based,
though it is 24 by seven IMPS and

00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:06.635
UPI are also instant and real time.

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:10.865
Any ft, however, is the one that
traditionally processes transactions

00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:14.465
in batches, like collecting a bunch
of them and clearing them together.

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:17.225
And yes, it is now 24 by seven.

00:12:17.555 --> 00:12:19.625
The key differentiator is batches.

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:21.725
That's NF T's signature move.

00:12:22.194 --> 00:12:27.055
Answer B. Example three question,
what does the term NPA stand

00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:28.765
for in the context of banking?

00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:31.104
A, national payment agency?

00:12:31.314 --> 00:12:37.194
B, non-performing asset C, new policy
agreement, D, non-profit account.

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:40.135
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:40.765
Okay.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.074
This is a straightforward,
full form question.

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:48.025
NPA is a term you'll hear a lot in banking
news, usually with a worried expression.

00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:51.865
It refers to a loan that has stopped
performing for the bank, meaning

00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:53.425
the borrower isn't paying back.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:57.355
The correct full form, as we
discussed, is non-performing asset.

00:12:57.685 --> 00:13:00.145
The other options are
just there to confuse you.

00:13:00.325 --> 00:13:04.705
It's a classic case of factual
recall answer B. Thank you.

00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:05.890
See you in the next lecture.
