Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on preventive vigilance.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.650
First, let's understand the concept.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.520
Preventive vigilance is a
wonderfully proactive approach.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.190
Think of it as being the smart person
who fixes the leaky pipe before the

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.930
house floods, rather than waiting for the
mess and then starting the blame game.

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:29.994
It's all about preventing corruption,
malpractices, and any other

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:32.485
irregularities within an organization.

00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:37.675
It focuses on finding and plugging
those sneaky loopholes and systems,

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:42.444
procedures, and rules that could
potentially invite corrupt practices.

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:45.760
The ultimate goal, my
friend, is to build a solid.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.160
Transparent system where the chance for
any unethical behavior is minimized.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.650
This in turn helps to foster a culture
of integrity and accountability.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.230
It's a continuous cycle of review risk
assessment, and implementing corrective

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.720
measures to keep things running smoothly
and ethically, real world relevance.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.675
Now, why should you care?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.450
In the real world, this
concept is a superhero.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.720
Take Ethical banking
operations, for example.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.730
It ensures the bank operates ethically
and protects customer interests.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.080
It's a huge tool for fraud
mitigation, helping to spot and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.530
reduce risks of fraud and financial
problems before they blow up.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.895
It also champions transparency,
promoting accountability in

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:38.615
all banking transactions,
which is something we all want.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:43.655
This directly contributes to reputation
protection, safeguarding the bank's

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.785
good name, and its financial health.

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:50.645
All of this helps build a secure
environment, creating a trustworthy

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.565
financial space for everyone.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:58.655
And finally, it's absolutely essential for
regulatory compliance and good governance.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.710
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.500
Questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.970
About 40% of questions are
definition or objective based,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.200
asking things like what is the
primary aim of preventive vigilance?

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.255
Another 30% are component
or mechanism based.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:23.695
For instance, which of the following is
a key aspect of preventive vigilance?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.135
Then we have 20% that are
role or application based.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:32.095
Like how does preventive vigilance
contribute to good governance?

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:37.825
And a small but important 10% are
fact-based questions usually related

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.135
to bodies like the CVC or CBI.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.930
Asking something like, which body is
primarily responsible for vigilance

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.910
in central government organizations?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.245
Knowing this breakdown helps you focus
your preparation formulas and tricks.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.030
Now for the fun part, since
this is a conceptual topic,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.980
there are no maths formulas.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.060
Thank goodness.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.310
The tricks are all about understanding
the core ideas and keywords.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.440
Just remember PV equals
proactive plus prevention.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.415
It's all about stopping
issues before they even start.

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:20.955
The keywords you should look for are
transparency, accountability, integrity,

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:26.925
systemic improvement, risk assessment,
ethical culture, and good governance.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:31.410
A very important trick is to
know that preventive is the

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:33.225
absolute opposite of pun.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.360
Think of it like this.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.600
Preventive vigilance
happens before the incident.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.800
It involves proactive measures
and it's system focused.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000
Punitive action, on the other
hand, happens after the incident.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.270
It's reactive and it's offender focused.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.310
Always ask why.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:56.535
Why is a certain rule in
place could it be misused?

00:03:56.985 --> 00:04:01.785
Questioning the purpose and vulnerability
of systems is the key to finding

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.945
loopholes before they are exploited.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.570
Methods of solving.

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.900
So how do you tackle
questions on this topic?

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.410
First, have a solid
conceptual understanding.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.120
Grasp the meaning of preventive,
which is stopping before and

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.370
vigilance, which is watchfulness.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.000
Combine them and you get
proactive watchfulness.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.909
Second, identify the key pillars.

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:32.250
Recognize that its main components are
system improvements, risk management,

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:34.770
and fostering an ethical environment.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.200
Third, and this is crucial.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.500
You must distinguish
it from pun vigilance.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:43.890
It's not about punishment,
it's about prevention.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.599
Fourth, related to governance,
connect the concept to bigger

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.979
ideas like good governance,
transparency, and accountability.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.140
And finally know the general role of
institutions like the Central Vigilance

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.660
Commission in promoting these ideas.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.520
Shortcuts and smart techniques
for some smart techniques.

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:07.979
Here's a good mnemonic for the principles.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.460
Think of Tai transparency, accountability,
integrity, like a good cup of chai.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.349
But for organizations, when you see
multiple choice questions, use the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.780
elimination strategy immediately.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.430
Get rid of any options that describe
reactive measures or punishment.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.520
Always focus on before any option that
talks about taking action before a

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.490
problem arises is very likely your answer.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.310
Also, look for contextual clues.

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.349
Words like systemic, proactive
risk assessment and strengthening

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.120
controls are your friends.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.180
And if a question asks about objectives,
quickly scan for options that aim to

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.490
reduce opportunities for corruption.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.190
Let's clear up some common mistakes.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.880
The biggest one is confusing
it with punitive action.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.130
Remember, preventive vigilance is
not about punishing offenders, it's

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.230
about preventing the offense itself.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.690
Another mistake is believing it's
only about individuals, while

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.670
individual honesty is important.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.410
This concept is primarily about
fixing the system and procedures,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.970
not just watching people.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.690
People also fall into the trap
of ignoring systemic loopholes.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.340
Thinking corruption is just a
moral failing, but weak systems

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.320
are an open invitation for trouble.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.950
Also, don't think it's
no one-time activity.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.440
Preventive vigilance is a continuous
ongoing process, not just a single audit.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.735
Lastly, never underestimate
its importance.

00:06:45.284 --> 00:06:49.544
Some might think catching crooks is
more exciting, but preventing crime

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:54.135
in the first place has a much bigger
long-term impact on an organization's

00:06:54.135 --> 00:06:56.505
health WH framework summary.

00:06:56.955 --> 00:07:00.255
Let's quickly wrap up the core
idea with a simple framework.

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:01.300
So what is it?

00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:06.735
It's all about proactive measures to
prevent corruption by improving systems.

00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:12.555
Why do we do it to foster integrity,
ensure transparency, and reduce

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.535
the chances for unethical behavior.

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:20.175
When is it applied Continuously, my
friend, in all processes and policies.

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:24.795
Where is it used in government
departments, public sector units,

00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:27.465
banks, and even private organizations.

00:07:27.855 --> 00:07:28.785
Who is involved?

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:33.885
Management, vigilance departments, all
employees and oversight bodies like

00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:39.285
the CVC and how is it banned through
systemic reforms risk assessments,

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:44.595
adopting technology and providing ethical
training, fully worked out examples.

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:47.385
All right, let's work
through some examples.

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:49.784
Example, one question.

00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:54.344
What is the primary objective of
preventive vigilance in an organization?

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:57.945
A, to punish employees
found guilty of corruption.

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:03.555
B, to identify and plug loopholes in
systems that could lead to corruption.

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:08.355
C to conduct surprise raids on
offices to catch corrupt officials.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.500
D to recover funds lost due
to fraudulent activities.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.630
Understand the question before.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.920
Moving to explanation.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.480
Let's break it down.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.080
The question asks for the
primary objective, and the

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.630
key word is preventive option.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.890
A talks about punishment, which
is punish, not preventive.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.180
So A is out.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.730
Option C talks about rates to catch
officials, which is a reactive measure.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.110
So C is also out.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.600
Option D is about recovering lost
funds, which happens after the fraud.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.440
That's remedial, not
preventive, so D is incorrect.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.080
Option B, however, talks about identifying
and plugging loopholes in systems.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.010
This is a perfect description of
a proactive measure to prevent

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.880
corruption, which is the heart
of preventive vigilance, correct?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.280
Answer B, example two.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:05.635
Question, which of the following
is a characteristic feature

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:07.315
of preventive vigilance?

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:11.545
A, it focuses on
post-event investigations.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:15.205
B, it is a reactive
approach to corruption.

00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:20.635
C, it emphasizes systemic
improvements and ethical environment.

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:25.765
Building D. It is solely dependent
on individual moral conduct.

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.155
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:31.065
4K.

00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:32.715
Let's analyze this.

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.025
We need a characteristic feature.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:38.715
Option A says post-event investigations.

00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:41.085
That's reactive, so it's wrong.

00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:46.215
Option B explicitly says it's a
reactive approach, which directly

00:09:46.215 --> 00:09:47.715
contradicts the definition.

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:48.975
So B is wrong.

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:51.045
Now look at option C.

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:54.825
It says it emphasizes
systemic improvements and

00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:56.025
ethical environment building.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.449
This aligns perfectly with
creating a system where

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.219
corruption struggles to survive.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.079
This looks very promising.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.620
Option D says, it is solely dependent on
individual moral conduct, while individual

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.050
morality is a factor, preventive vigilance
is much broader, focusing on systems.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.079
So D is incomplete and incorrect.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.375
Correct answer C. Example three question
in the context of banking, how does

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:30.695
preventive vigilance primarily contribute
to safeguarding the organization?

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:35.195
A, by imposing strict penalties
on defaulting borrowers.

00:10:35.585 --> 00:10:39.965
B, by ensuring timely recovery
of non-performing assets.

00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:41.135
That is NPAs.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.750
C, by strengthening internal controls
and reducing opportunities for fraud.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.599
D, by conducting external audits to
assess financial health, understand the

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:54.535
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:57.735
Let's solve this final one.

00:10:57.735 --> 00:11:02.055
In a banking context, how does
it safeguard a bank option?

00:11:02.055 --> 00:11:06.765
A imposing penalties on borrowers
is about loan recovery, not

00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:08.415
internal preventive vigilance.

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:10.125
So A is incorrect.

00:11:10.515 --> 00:11:14.955
Option B, recovering NPAs is a
financial management function.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:19.155
While important, it's not the primary
mechanism of preventive vigilance.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.600
So B is out.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.750
Option D. Conducting external audits
is a form of oversight, often periodic

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.130
or reactive, not the continuous
internal process of prevention.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.350
So D is not the best answer.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.060
Option C talks about strengthening
internal controls and reducing

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.500
opportunities for fraud.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.090
This is the bullseye.

00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:46.010
Strong controls are the very definition
of preventing issues before they occur.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.470
Correct answer c. Thank you.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.120
See you in the next lecture.
