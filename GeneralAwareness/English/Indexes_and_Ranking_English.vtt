00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.860
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on indexes and rankings.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.290
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.200
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.980
So what is all this fuss
about indexes and rankings?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.189
Ra, it's simple.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.820
Think of them as giant
global report cards.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.689
They are tools used to measure and compare
how countries, regions, or even companies

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.060
are performing on different subjects.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.239
They take all the complex data like a
messy student's notebook and consolidate

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.300
it into a single need score or rank.

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:46.715
This gives us a quick snapshot of
how things are going in areas like

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:51.005
the economy, social development,
environment, and governance.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.685
Why do we need this?

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:57.845
Well, these indicators help us
understand global trends, pinpoint

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:02.135
areas where we need to pull up
our socks and guide our leaders in

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:03.860
making smarter policy decisions.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.850
Measurement tools.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.020
These are not your regular school
protractors and scales, my friend.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.300
They are sophisticated measurement tools
that allow for powerful comparative

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.430
analysis, a thorough global assessment
of performance, and a very neat and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.650
tidy process of data consolidation.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.000
Real world relevance.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.790
Now, why should you, especially if you're
looking at a career in finance, care about

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.030
this, it has immense real world relevance.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.060
Economic health assessment is a big one.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.830
Indexes like the global competitiveness
Index are like a country's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.289
financial horoscope, helping bankers
understand its economic strength and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.130
potential for growth, which directly
influences investment decisions.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.990
For investment climate analysis
rankings like the old ease of doing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.150
business report, give insights into
the regulatory jungle, which is crucial

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.980
for figuring out if a business will
survive and for assessing lending risks.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.725
Policy impact evaluation is another.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:14.675
Understanding an index, like the
human development index, lets bankers

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:19.385
gauge the socioeconomic wellbeing
of a nation, which believe me

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:24.305
indirectly affects market stability
and a country's credit worthiness.

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:26.435
Then there's risk management.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.489
An index, like the Global Peace Index
or the Corruption Perceptions Index,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.859
can act as a warning signal highlighting
geopolitical and governance risks that

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.030
could seriously impact international
operations and trade finance.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.519
Looking for sectoral opportunities.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.220
Indexes related to innovation or digital
transformation can point you directly

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.109
towards emerging sectors and gold
mines for financial services expansion.

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:59.645
And finally for international relations
and trade, being aware of trade related

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:04.445
indexes helps in understanding the
flow of global trade and identifying

00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:08.705
juicy opportunities for foreign
exchange and trade finance services.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.370
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.799
All right, let's get down to business
based on past patterns for your exam.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.560
Questions on this topic
are quite predictable.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.329
A massive 40% of questions
are all about India's rank.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.490
They'll directly ask for India specific
rank in something like the HDI or GHI.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.130
So you must memorize recent ranks.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.320
About 30% of questions will ask for
the top ranked country, the Shahar

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.220
Maji, son of the world, like Finland
in the World Happiness Report.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.960
Just try to recall the top two or
three countries for the key indexes.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.950
Around 20% of questions are
about the publishing body.

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:56.665
They want to know who is creating these
report cards, like the UNDP for the HDI.

00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:00.895
It's a matching game associate
the index with its publisher

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:05.815
and the last 10% will test the
purpose or parameters of the index.

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:09.175
Checking if you know what
an index actually measures.

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:14.245
For example, knowing that the GHI
focuses on hunger and malnutrition,

00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:15.925
not just food production.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.240
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.440
Now, there are no mathematical
formulas here, thank goodness.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.190
But effective memorization
and recall are everything.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.260
First, use the association method,
link the index name with its

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.120
publisher, and the top country.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.580
For instance, think Happiness.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.990
Finland is always happy,
published by SDS and a network

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.525
trying to make societies happy.

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:42.725
Simple.

00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:48.365
Next try categorization group
indexes by their theme, like

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:51.425
economic, social, or environmental.

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:53.675
This makes recall easier.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:59.440
For example, economic indexes
include G-D-P-G-C-I-E-O-D-B.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.560
Social indexes are H-D-I-G-H-I-W-H-R.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.170
You can also use memon, create
short memorable phrases for the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.270
human development index components.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.570
Remember, HEL, which stands for
health, education and Living Standard.

00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:22.515
It's easy to remember,
especially during a tough exam.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:28.875
Use flashcards, create physical or digital
ones with the index name on one side

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:34.785
and all the gossip on the other India's
rank top country and who published it.

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:41.985
For example, front Global Hunger
Index, back Rank 111, published by

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:43.935
Concern Worldwide and Wealth Hunger.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.560
And most importantly, regular
revision, a little revision

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.750
daily, maybe two, three indexes.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.320
Keeps the information fresh in
your mind for the long term.

00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:58.125
Methods of solving.

00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:02.025
Solving these questions is
mainly about factual recall

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:04.335
and a bit of logical deduction.

00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:06.855
First, identify keywords.

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:11.205
Read the question carefully to
spot which specific index or

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.885
ranking they are talking about.

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:15.515
Then recall core information.

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:20.945
Immediately try to access your memory
for the publisher, India's rank, and

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:23.315
the top ranked country for that index.

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:27.965
If you are unsure, cross reference,
eliminate the options you know

00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:31.864
are wrong by using other facts
you remember about the index.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.590
Always focus on recent data.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.280
Ranks change annually, so
make sure you are using the

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.930
latest information available.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.070
Finally, for purpose-based
questions, understand the why.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.930
Think about the main theme.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.260
A hunger index is obviously about hunger
and food security shortcuts and smart

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.810
techniques want some smart techniques.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:58.179
First focus on high impact indexes.

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.059
Prioritize learning the most frequently
asked ones like the H-T-I-G-H-I,

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:09.039
world Happiness Report and others
don't waste energy on obscure ones.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.989
Use trend analysis for India
instead of just memorizing the rank.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.880
Also note if India's position has
improved, declined, or stayed the same.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.020
This can help you answer
analytical questions.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.549
Employ the top three strategy
for very important indexes.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.760
Remember the top three
countries, not just the winner.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.229
The examiners can be sneaky and ask
for the second or third position.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.539
Make a publisher association.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.609
Get familiar with big organizations
like the UNDP, world Economic

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.690
Forum and World Bank, and the kinds
of reports they usually release.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.175
And a golden tip, follow
daily current affairs.

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:53.915
Make it a habit to note down any
new indexes or rankings mentioned

00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.395
in the news along with India's
position and the publisher.

00:07:57.695 --> 00:07:59.645
It's fresh material for the exam.

00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:02.195
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.420
Now let's talk about the common traps.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:11.090
The biggest one is using outdated
information like coating a 2022 rank.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.160
When the 2023 report is out.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.870
Another is confusing ranks
mixing up India's HDI rank of

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.500
1 34 with its GHI rank of 111.

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:22.525
Be careful.

00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:27.594
Also, avoid attributing an incorrect
publishing body, like confusing

00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:29.245
the Wall Bank with the IMF.

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.685
It's a common slip up.

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:34.405
A big misconception is
misunderstanding the purpose.

00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:39.534
For instance, thinking the GHI is about
food production instead of hunger levels.

00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:42.745
Also be aware of no ranking scenarios.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.150
Some indexes exclude countries.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.100
If they don't have enough data, don't
fall into the trap of over memorization.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.150
Trying to learn every single
index will only lead to confusion.

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.550
Focus on eight to 10 key ones.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.010
Lastly, don't overlook methodology
changes as sometimes the way indexes

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.930
are calculated can be updated.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.000
WH framework summary.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.650
So to summarize it all, in a
nutshell, what are indexes.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.030
They are quantitative measures that
assess and compare performance.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.710
Why are they important?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.760
They help us understand global
trends, evaluate policies,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.680
and make strategic decisions.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.300
When are they released?

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.920
Typically, these reports come out
annually to provide fresh insights.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.390
Where are they applied globally,
my friend, to assess countries,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.400
regions, and even cities.

00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:36.755
Who is involved?

00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:41.915
International organizations and think
tanks, publish them and everyone from

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.985
governments to researchers use them.

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:50.015
And how are they created by collecting
tons of data, applying specific methods,

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.745
and calculating scores to assign ranks.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.380
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.180
Let's try some questions.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.160
Example, one question, which
international organization publishes

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.810
the human development index?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.240
HDIA, world Bank.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.580
B. International Monetary Fund.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.150
IMFC, United Nations Development Program.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.150
U-N-D-P-D, world Economic Forum.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.215
WEF understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.689
Step one is to understand the question
asks for the publisher of the HDI.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.770
Step two is to recall the
key details about HDI, which

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.270
measures human development.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.640
Step three is to identify that the
HDI is a flagship report of the United

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.310
Nations Development Program or UNDP.

00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:45.089
So in step four, we select the correct
option, which is c. Example two question.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.670
As per the latest available data, what was
India's rank in the Global Hunger Index?

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:51.989
A 89th.

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:55.859
B 101st C. 111th.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.750
D 120th.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.020
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:05.445
Here the question asks for
India's latest rank in the GHI.

00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:10.035
We recall that the GHI measures
hunger and is published by Concern

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:13.965
Worldwide and Wealth Hunger Hill
Fair, accessing the latest data.

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:19.125
We remember that as per the 2023
report, India was ranked 111

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:21.225
out of hundred and 25 countries.

00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:27.235
Therefore, the correct option is c.
Example three question, which country

00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:31.225
consistently ranks as the happiest
country in the world Happiness report?

00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:37.825
A, Switzerland, b Norway, C Finland,
d Denmark, understand the question

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:39.170
before moving to explanation.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.310
The question asks for the
consistently top ranked country

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.840
in the World Happiness Report.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.380
We recall this report
is from the U-N-S-E-S-N.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.950
We also recall that one country
has been the champion of

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.360
happiness for several years.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.610
Now that country is Finland.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.970
So based on this, the correct
option is C. Thank you.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.400
See you in the next lecture.
