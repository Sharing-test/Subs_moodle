00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on NPA News.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.570
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.480
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:19.305
So what is all this fuss about
non-performing assets or NPAs?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.955
Think of it like this.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:26.174
You lend your friends some money and
they promise to pay you back, but then

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.655
for over 90 days, silence, crickets.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.830
That loan has now become an NPA for you.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.660
For banks, NPAs are loans or advances
where the principle or interest payment

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.990
has been overdue for a period of 90 days.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
In simpler terms, when a borrower
fails to make payments on a loan for

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.740
three months or more, that loan gets
the dreaded NPA tag from the bank.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.150
These assets completely stop generating
income for the bank, which directly

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.430
hits its profitability and financial
health, NPAs are a massive headache

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.290
for banks because they represent a
loss of potential income and can even

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.390
lead to a decline in their capital.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.910
Real world relevance.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.640
Now, why should you, my
friend, care about NPA News?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.590
Because understanding this is crucial
as it directly impacts a bank's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.320
financial stability and its operational
strategies for anyone aiming for roles

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.660
like credit officer or law officer.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.920
Monitoring NPA Trends helps
in assessing credit risk and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.780
implementing recovery measures.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.250
These are key responsibilities
you'll need to master for your exam.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:47.295
Topics under NPN News, when we
dive into the world of NPAs,

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.755
we explore several key areas.

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:55.035
We look into the causes of NPAs,
such as economic slowdowns, industry

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:59.835
specific troubles, poor credit appraisal
by banks, and of course willful

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.905
defaults by mischievous borrowers.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.300
We study the impact of NPAs, like
reduced profitability for banks, a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.340
lower capacity to lend the need for
increased provisioning, and the overall

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.620
drag on the nation's economic growth.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.810
We also cover the classification of
NPAs into neat little categories,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.959
substandard, doubtful, and loss assets.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.930
Then we have the NPA
resolution mechanisms.

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:30.095
Which are the tools used to fix
the problem, like the SAR Fasi

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:36.185
Act, the IBC asset reconstruction
companies, or arcs and debt recovery

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:38.975
tribunals, also known as DRTs.

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:44.195
We'll also touch upon government and
RBI initiatives, and finally look

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:49.445
at recent trends and data like the
current NPA figures and policy changes.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.674
Breakdown of question types
based on past patterns in the

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.114
general awareness sections.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.834
Questions about NPA News
follow a predictable format.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:05.595
About 30% of the time you'll get
definition based questions directly asking

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:08.355
for the meaning of NPA or a related term.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:11.805
Fact-based questions make up another 25%.

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:16.095
These are about specific acts,
committees, or recent initiatives.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:20.035
Impact based questions asking
about the consequences of high

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.674
NPAs account for about 20%.

00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:27.024
Mechanism based questions, which
inquire about the recovery tools and

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:29.995
processes are around 15% of the mix.

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:35.095
And lastly, current affairs questions
based on the very latest news reports

00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:37.555
or data make up the final 10%.

00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:40.035
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:44.475
While there are no mathematical
formula to memorize, thank goodness,

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.905
understanding key terms is vital.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:50.535
The core NPA definition is simple overdue.

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:55.635
For more than 90 days, the classification
hierarchy goes from bad to worse.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:59.805
A substandard asset has been
an NPA for up to 12 months.

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:04.605
It becomes a doubtful asset if it
stays an NPA for more than 12 months.

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:08.735
A loss asset is where the bank
has identified the loss but

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:10.445
hasn't written it off entirely.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:15.995
You must remember the acronyms, the SAR
Farsi Act, which is the Securitization

00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:21.125
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets
and Enforcement of Security Act 2002.

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:27.635
Then there's IBC, the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code from 2016, and finally, a

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.485
RC, which an asset reconstruction company.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.940
Methods of solving to effectively
tackle questions on this topic.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.760
First, ensure you have conceptual clarity.

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:43.739
Get a thorough understanding of the core
NPA definition and its classifications.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.440
Next, use KE term association.

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:51.989
Link acts like sar, Fasi and IBC
directly to their role in NPA resolution.

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.280
Then practice impact analysis to
understand the cause and effect

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.890
relationship between NPAs and bank health.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.740
Always follow up with current affairs
integration by reading financial news,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.650
and finally use categorization, mentally
sought information into causes, impacts,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.480
and solutions for easier recall.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:14.535
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:16.755
Here are some smart strategies.

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:20.415
First, the 90 day rule should
be automatic, instantly.

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:22.155
Recall that overdue period.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.015
Second use acronym.

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:24.495
Recall.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:29.730
Memorize sfai, I-B-C-A-R-C
and DRT, and the full forms.

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.840
Third, maintain a sharp
RBI and government focus.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:37.770
Pay special attention to any new
schemes or rules they announce.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.929
Fourth, practice transporting.

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.609
Look for keywords in news articles
like provisioning, write-offs or bad

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:49.859
bank to quickly identify and PA content
and in multiple choice questions, use

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:54.155
the elimination strategy to discard
options clearly irrelevant to banking.

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:57.555
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:00.465
Please be aware of these common traps.

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:02.295
A big one is confusing.

00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:03.795
NPA with default.

00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:06.435
A default is just one missed payment.

00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:10.245
It becomes an NPA only after
90 days of being overdue.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.345
Another error is incorrect.

00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:16.095
Timeframes like mixing up the
90 day rule or the 12 month

00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:17.475
period for substandard assets.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.260
People also tend to mix
up resolution mechanisms.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.310
Confusing what the SAR
Farsi Act, IBC and DRTs do.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.970
A major mistake is ignoring
current affairs and relying

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.770
only on static definitions.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.680
And please don't be
overlooking loss assets.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.315
Remember, they are the highest NPA
category, even if not yet written off.

00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:41.235
W Edge Framework summary.

00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:44.505
Let's summarize this with
a quick W Edge framework.

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:46.125
What is an NPA?

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:50.085
It's a loan or advance where
payment is overdue for 90 days.

00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:51.615
Why is it a big deal?

00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:57.165
It impacts bank profitability, lending
capacity, and the entire economy's health.

00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:59.355
When does a loan become an NPA?

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:02.145
When payment is overdue
for 90 days or more.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.540
Where does it happen?

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.420
Primarily in the banking
and financial sector?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.680
Who is involved?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.400
The borrowers who fail to repay
and the banks holding these bad

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.440
assets, and how is it managed?

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.730
Banks identify, classify, and
then resolve them through various

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.800
legal and financial mechanisms.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.470
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.235
All right, let's put this
knowledge to the test.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.320
Example, one question.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.330
A loan account is classified as a
non-performing asset, or NPA, if the

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.240
principle or interest payment remains
overdue for a period of a 30 days.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.330
B, 60 days, C 90 days.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.130
D one 20 days understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.800
The solution is quite direct.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.610
Step one is to understand the
core definition of an NPA,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.150
which is about a payment being
overdue for a specific duration.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.130
Step two is to recall that standard
period as per RBI guidelines.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.990
A loan account becomes an NPA if the
payment is overdue for more than 90 days.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.230
Step three is to match
this rule with the options.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.360
Clearly, 90 days is the correct
option, correct Option C, 90 days.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.390
Example two question.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.440
Which of the following Acts is
primarily designed to facilitate the

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.730
recovery of secure debts by banks
and financial institutions without

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.200
the intervention of the court?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:37.980
A Indian Contract Act 1872 B. Negotiable
Instruments Act 1881 C. Cfai Act 2000 2D.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.750
Companies Act 2013.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.810
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:44.849
Let's solve this.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.849
Step one is to analyze
the question's focus.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.750
It's asking for a specific law
that helps banks recover secure

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.189
debt without going to court.

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:53.640
First.

00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:56.370
Step two is to evaluate the options.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.660
The Indian Contract Act deals with
contracts, the Negotiable Instruments

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.334
Act with checks and bills, and
the companies act with companie.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.270
The SFAI Act, however, is the one that
empowers banks to recover their NPAs

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.230
without court intervention by taking
possession of the secured assets.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.765
So in step three, we identify the correct
act, correct option C, sfai Act 2002 to.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.665
Example three question.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:27.645
Which of the following is considered the
final stage of NPA classification where

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:32.055
the bank or auditor has identified the
loss but has not yet written it off?

00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:34.605
Wholly a substandard asset.

00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:36.885
B. Doubtful asset C.

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:37.814
Loss asset.

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:42.525
D. Standard asset understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.280
For our final example, step
one is to understand the NPA

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.689
classification hierarchy.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.459
NPAs move from substandard, which
is an NPA for up to 12 months to

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:57.900
doubtful, which is an NPA for over
12 months, and finally to loss asset.

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:02.195
A loss asset is one where the loss
has been identified, but the amount

00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:03.785
hasn't been written off entirely.

00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:07.295
Step two is to identify what
the question is describing.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:11.855
It's asking for an asset where loss is
identified but not yet written off, which

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:14.165
is the exact definition of a loss asset.

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:17.465
A standard asset, by the
way, is not an NPA at all.

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:20.915
So for step three, we select
the correct classification,

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:23.255
correct option C, loss asset.

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:24.785
Thank you.

00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:26.525
See you in the next lecture.
