00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on mergers and

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.970
acquisitions in banking companies.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.980
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PXD or a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.920
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.650
All right, let's start with the basics.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.830
Mergers and acquisitions or MNA are
fancy terms for when banks either join

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.870
hands or one bank gobbles up another.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:29.955
Think of it as the strategic
matchmaking of the financial world.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.295
First up, we have a merger.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.545
This is like a grand wedding.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:39.135
Imagine two banking companies
agreeing to combine everything they

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:44.175
own their operations and assets
to form a completely new banking.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.580
The original companies are no more.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.280
They say, Tata, bye-bye to their
independent existence and a new, much

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.769
larger bank is born from their union.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.019
This is usually done to get a bigger
market share, run things more efficiently,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.840
or to offer a whole buffet of services.

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:04.735
To customers.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:09.115
Then there's the acquisition,
which is also called a takeover.

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:12.175
This is a bit more dramatic.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:17.575
It's when one banking company goes
shopping and buys a controlling stake.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:22.135
In another one, the acquiring bank,
the buyer becomes the big boss.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.970
The acquired bank often loses its
own name and identity and gets

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.370
absorbed into the buyer operations.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.610
The usual reasons for this are to expand
into new areas, get rid of a competitor,

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.860
or to get access to a new set of
customers or some cool new technology.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.870
So while both mergers and acquisitions
are designed to create a stronger,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.120
more competitive financial giant.

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:53.185
You see they are quite different
in how they're structured legally.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:58.555
One is a marriage, the other is
a buyout, real world relevance.

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:03.535
Now you might be thinking, why should
I care about this corporate drama?

00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:09.205
Well, my friend understanding m and a
in banking is super important because it

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:11.370
directly shapes the banks you deal with.

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:16.375
It affects their stability, the
kind of customer service you get and

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.204
even the rules they have to follow.

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:22.855
It gives you a peek into the financial
health and the future plans of the

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.555
banks you might work with or even for.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.635
Let's dive into the main reasons
or topics of interest here.

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.155
First, increased market share.

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:37.795
When banks combine, they naturally get
to serve a much larger customer base and

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.894
beef up their presence in the market.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.440
Second is cost synergies.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.840
Merging can slash operational costs
because the new entity can share things

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.850
like buildings, fancy computer systems,
and can also optimize its staff.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.910
Less duplication means more savings.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.010
Third, diversification of services.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.370
M and a is a quick way for banks
to suddenly be able to offer a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.500
wider range of financial products.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.080
One day they only offer loans.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.680
The next day they have
insurance and mutual funds too.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.320
Next geographic expansion.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.190
A bank in Mumbai wanting to
open a branch in Chennai.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.240
Instead of starting from scratch,
it can just acquire a local

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.740
bank that's already there.

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.204
Instant presence.

00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:27.515
Then there's risk management.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.255
It's believed that a larger,
more diversified bank is like a

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:36.454
big sturdy ship, better prepared
to sail through stormy economic

00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:38.885
weather and handle financial risks.

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:41.825
And finally, regulatory compliance.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:47.825
Sometimes the government or the big
boss, RBI pushes for mergers to rescue

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:53.285
wika banks or to make sure all banks
meet new stricter capital requirements.

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:55.615
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.135
Okay, let's get to the juicy part.

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:02.305
Based on patterns in the general
awareness sections of your exam,

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.345
here's how they'll try to test you.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:08.995
About 30% of questions are
definition or concept based.

00:04:09.355 --> 00:04:13.255
They will ask you for the plain
vanilla definition of a merger and

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:18.265
acquisition, or even specific types
like horizontal or vertical mergers.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:21.265
This is a test of your
fundamental clarity.

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:27.145
Then about 25% of questions focus
on the reasons or objectives.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:30.265
These questions want to
know why banks do this.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:34.224
Things like achieving economies
of scale, market expansion,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.235
or improving their loan books.

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:42.105
Another 20% of questions are about
the impact or consequences Here.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:46.785
The focus is on how m and A affects
everyone, customers, employees,

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:48.885
and the banking sector as a whole.

00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:53.805
Think branch closures, job cuts,
or maybe even better services.

00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:58.735
About 15% are based on recent
examples or case studies.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:03.115
These questions will refer to big
famous mergers or acquisitions

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:07.105
that happened recently, especially
in the Indian banking scene.

00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:10.315
This is where keeping up
with the news pays off.

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.570
And finally a small 10%
on regulatory aspects.

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:18.679
These questions check if you know
the role of the Reserve Bank of India

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:24.080
government policies or the legal rules
that govern MNA in our banking industry.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.600
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.190
Now, in this subject, formulas
are not about math, but

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.290
about concepts and keywords.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.320
The most important concept is synergy.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.420
The whole point of m and a is to achieve
this magical thing called synergy.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.580
It's the idea that the combined value
of the two banks will be greater than

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.469
the sum of their individual values.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:53.280
It's the classic two plus
two equals five situation.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.580
Next, let's get our key
terminology straight.

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.960
A merger is when two banks
combine to form a new bank.

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.369
An acquisition or takeover
is when one bank buys another

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:07.260
and the buyer keeps its name.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.450
Consolidation is very similar to a
merger where a new entity is formed.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:15.115
Amalgamation is the legal term.

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:16.675
You'll often hear in India.

00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:19.344
It's used interchangeably with merger.

00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:23.755
A D merger is the opposite,
where one big company splits

00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:25.675
into two or more smaller ones.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.165
And what about the types of mergers?

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:33.415
A horizontal merger is when banks
offering similar services combined, like

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.975
two regular commercial banks merging.

00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:41.195
This is the most common type, a vertical
merger is when banks at different stages

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:43.354
of the financial service chain combine.

00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:48.305
This is less common in pure banking,
and a conglomerate merger is when

00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:52.115
two completely unrelated financial
businesses decide to combine.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:56.615
And here's a regulatory body
trick for you for most questions

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.625
about banking regulation in India.

00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:03.665
If you're ever in doubt, the Reserve
Bank of India, RBI is always the

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:08.975
big boss and the right answer for
primary oversight methods of solving.

00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:13.535
Solving problems here means
answering conceptual questions

00:07:13.535 --> 00:07:15.065
correctly in the exam.

00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.735
First, have conceptual polarity.

00:07:18.335 --> 00:07:23.705
You must must understand the difference
between a merger and acquisition.

00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.265
No confusion allowed.

00:07:25.655 --> 00:07:28.145
Second, identify objectives.

00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:33.275
Learn the common reasons banks
engage in m and a. Think growth,

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.165
cost cutting, and market power.

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:38.045
Third, understand the impact.

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:43.325
Think about the good and bad effects
on everyone involved, customers,

00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:46.175
employees, shareholders, and the economy.

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:49.375
Fourth, have regulatory
framework knowledge.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:53.665
Know the role of the key
players, especially the RBI and

00:07:53.665 --> 00:07:57.385
the general approval process
for m and a in Indian banking.

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:01.195
And finally, current
affairs integration is key.

00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:07.195
You must stay updated with recent big
ticket mergers and acquisitions in India.

00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:10.430
This will help you as those
case study based questions.

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:15.295
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:08:15.355 --> 00:08:16.105
Here you go.

00:08:16.525 --> 00:08:18.355
Use keyword association.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:23.875
When you see the phrase new entity
formed, your brain should scream merger.

00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:28.045
When you see one company buys
another, it's an acquisition.

00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:31.200
Remember the RBI as the default regulator.

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:35.955
Unless the question talks specifically
about market competition issues

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:40.784
where the competition Commission
of India or CCI might step in, just

00:08:40.784 --> 00:08:45.945
assume RBI is the primary regulator
for banking m and a use elimination

00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:48.585
strategy in multiple choice questions.

00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:52.875
If you are not sure, get rid of the
options that are clearly nonsense.

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:56.814
This dramatically increases your
chances of guessing correctly.

00:08:57.235 --> 00:08:58.675
Focus on the why.

00:08:58.974 --> 00:09:03.265
So many questions are about the
reasons for m and a. Always think about

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:05.814
growth, efficiency, and market power.

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:10.525
And finally, do a quick scan
of headlines before your exam.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:14.785
Just browse the major banking MNN
news from the last year or two.

00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:17.599
It'll keep the big examples
fresh in your mind.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.820
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.870
All right.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.560
Let's talk about the common traps
that many friends fall into.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.140
The number one mistake is confusing.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.850
Merger and acquisition.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.640
People use them as if
they're the same thing.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.660
They are not.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.650
Remember, a merger creates a new
bank while in an acquisition,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.380
the buyer's identity remains.

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:44.484
Another one is assuming m
and a is always positive.

00:09:44.844 --> 00:09:49.885
While banks aim for big benefits,
these deals can face huge problems like

00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:54.685
difficult integration clashes between
company cultures and a complete failure

00:09:54.685 --> 00:09:56.694
to achieve those promised synergies.

00:09:57.114 --> 00:09:59.760
Some people believe
only private banks, me.

00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:03.045
This is completely false public sector.

00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:08.055
Banks in India have seen massive mergers
and consolidations like the mega merger

00:10:08.055 --> 00:10:13.185
of several public sector banks recently
don't ignore regulatory nuances.

00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:18.165
Yes, RBI is the primary regulator,
but other bodies like the Competition

00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:23.145
Commission of India CC, I also have a
say to ensure fair play in the market.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:26.775
And finally, don't focus
only on financials.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.120
M and a is not just about balance
sheets, it's a complex dance of

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.060
strategy, operations, and human emotions.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.280
WH framework summary.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.990
So to quickly summarize, using
our W framework, what is it?

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.680
It's the combination of two or
more banking entities, which

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.060
is a merger or one bank buying
another, which is an acquisition.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.440
Why does it happen?

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.340
The main goals are to achieve
growth, efficiency, market

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.470
dominance, or financial stability.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.880
When does it happen?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.820
Usually during times of economic change,
shifts in regulations, or when a bank

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.785
sees a golden opportunity for expansion.

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:11.785
Where does it happen primarily within the
banking and financial services sector,

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.365
both within India and internationally?

00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:16.195
Who are the players involved?

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:20.725
Banks, financial institutions, and
of course their regulatory masters

00:11:20.755 --> 00:11:22.915
like the RBI and the government.

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:28.135
And how is it done through complex
legal and financial processes, often

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:32.395
involving shares, paying cash, and
getting a whole lot of regulatory

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:35.425
approvals, fully worked out examples.

00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:38.485
Let's test our understanding
with a few examples.

00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:40.645
Example, one question.

00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:45.085
Which of the following statements
accurately differentiates a merger from

00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:47.305
an acquisition in the banking sector?

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:51.135
A, in a merger, one
bank purchases another.

00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:55.095
In an acquisition, two banks
combine to form a new entity.

00:11:55.425 --> 00:12:00.495
B. A merger results in a new legal
entity while an acquisition involves

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:02.865
one bank taking over another's control.

00:12:03.245 --> 00:12:08.405
C. Acquisitions are always friendly,
whereas mergers are often hostile.

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:11.945
D mergers primarily involve private banks.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:16.475
While acquisitions involve public
sector banks understand the question

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:18.215
before moving to explanation.

00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:20.885
The question wants the correct difference.

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:25.865
We know a merger creates a new entity
and an acquisition is a takeover.

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:29.825
Option A reverses the
definitions so it's wrong.

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:33.995
Option C is wrong because both
can be friendly or hostile.

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:38.615
Option D is wrong because both
public and primate banks do both.

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:41.675
Option B perfectly
captures the definition.

00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:46.625
A merger results in a new legal entity
while an acquisition is a takeover.

00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:48.545
So B is our answer.

00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:50.975
Example two question.

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:55.430
The primary objective for banks
undertaking mergers and acquisitions

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.349
to achieve economies of scale
is to A, increase the number of

00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:02.270
branches rapidly across the country.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.560
B, reduce the average cost per
unit of service by increasing

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.000
the volume of operations.

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:12.620
C, diversify their investment
portfolio into unrelated sectors.

00:13:13.094 --> 00:13:17.120
D, acquire new technological patents
from smaller FinTech companies.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:20.584
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:23.645
The key phrase here is economies of scale.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:27.425
This means getting cost
advantages from being bigger.

00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:29.105
Let's look at the options.

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:32.375
A is about expansion, not cost per unit.

00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:35.765
C is diversification
a different objective.

00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:38.584
D is about technology acquisition.

00:13:38.855 --> 00:13:44.375
Option B directly explains economies of
scale, reducing the average cost per unit

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.595
by increasing the volume of operations.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.270
That is the textbook definition,
therefore, B is the correct answer.

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:53.640
Example three question.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.050
In India, which of the following
is the Apex regulatory body that

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.740
provides the necessary approvals
and guidelines for mergers and

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.870
amalgamations of banking companies?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.081
A ministry of corporate affairs, MCA.

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:12.545
B. Securities and Exchange Board
of India, sebi C. Reserve Bank of

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:18.545
India, RBID TI io understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:23.314
This question is asking for the top
regulator for banking m and a in India.

00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:28.324
We discuss this in our trick section,
while MCA and SEBI have roles.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.980
The primary apex body for anything
related to banking supervision is the

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.880
RBI MI is a think tank, not a regulator.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.680
So without a doubt, the Reserve Bank
of India, RBI is the correct answer.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.120
Option C, it is.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.110
Thank you.

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:45.880
See you in the next lecture.
