00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.290
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on key government policies.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.380
This concept looks scary, don't worry.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.400
We brought snacks and
metaphors, concept, explanation.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.280
So what on earth are government policies?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.570
Think of them as the government's
official to-do list for the country.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.325
They are deliberate actions and
decisions taken to hit specific goals

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.755
and tackle society's big problems.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.145
These policies aren't
just dreamt up overnight.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.645
They go through a whole process
of research, public consultation,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.935
getting the thumbs up from parliament
and then the actual implementation.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:42.885
They cover everything from your money
and your education to your health,

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.465
farms, roads, and social welfare.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.270
The big idea is always to improve
our living standards, boost the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.620
economy, and make sure there's
social justice for your exam.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.520
Understanding these policies means
you need to become a bit of a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.140
detective, knowing their goals,
who they are for which ministry is

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.210
the boss and their key features.

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.164
Real world relevance.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:11.274
Now, why should you, especially
if you're looking at the banking

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:12.865
world, care about this stuff?

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:18.685
Because these policies directly influence
the financial sector every single day.

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:24.354
Take financial inclusion policies
like the famous P-M-J-D-Y expand

00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:27.560
the reach of banks, which directly
impacts branch operations.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.979
Then there's rural development.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.929
All those schemes for agriculture
heavily affect a bank's loan portfolio.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.869
Social security schemes like pensions and
insurance are often managed through banks.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.850
When the government rolls out industrial
and trade policies to boost economic

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.660
growth, it directly influences the
demand for credit from businesses.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.560
The Digital India Mission promotes
online transactions, completely

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.270
reshaping banking, technology, and
finally, regulatory compliance.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.790
Banks must strictly follow every guideline
issued by the government and the RBI.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.380
There's no escaping them.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.600
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.090
All right, let's peek into the examiner's
mind based on past patterns in the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.280
general awareness sections for your exam.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.580
Questions on policies come
in a few predictable flavors.

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:23.334
About 40% are direct fact-based questions.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.945
They'll just ask for the name of a policy.

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:29.635
It's launch here, the ministry
in charge, or a specific detail.

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:34.674
A classic example is when
was the Phan Man launched?

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.144
Simple and direct.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:40.704
Then around 30% are objective
or purpose-based questions.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.510
These focus on the why of the policy.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.380
For instance, what is the main
objective of the Aush Man?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.620
Parana?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.980
Here, you need to know
the soul of the scheme.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.840
About 15% of questions are
beneficiary or target group questions

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.739
which ask who the policy is for.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.230
Like the AL Pension Yona primarily
targets which section of the population.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.060
A smaller 10% are feature or
component-based questions, which zoom

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.350
into the nitty gritty details, asking
something like which of the following

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.079
is a key component of the SW ian.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.510
And finally, a spicy 5% are based
on current affairs or recent updates

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.910
focusing on new changes or initiatives.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.990
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.730
While you can't use algebra, here,
we have our own formulas and tricks.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.250
First, here are the key data points.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.100
You must memorize the exact policy name.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.880
Its launch date, or year, the
nodal ministry running the show.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.290
The primary objective, the target
beneficiaries, and two or three of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.300
its most important key features.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.060
Now for the tricks are
little memory jugar.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.760
Use acronym association link, P-M-J-D-Y to
Janna, which means people's wealth scheme,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.950
which points to financial inclusion.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.150
Try the year.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.720
Event link, connect a policies
launch year with another major

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.730
event to create a mental anchor.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.285
Use the ministry function match.

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:11.725
It's common sense that the Ministry of
Finance handles financial schemes and the

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:13.975
Ministry of Health handles health schemes.

00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:15.565
Spot keywords.

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.875
Identify a couple of unique words for each
policy that instantly trigger your memory.

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:26.815
And finally, use categorization group
policies by sector like financial health

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:29.305
or agriculture for much easier recall.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.710
Methods of solving when a policy question
appears in the exam, don't panic.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.120
Use these methods.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.490
First is the direct recall method.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.300
Read the question, access your
memorized facts and match the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.490
information to the options easy.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.270
If you are unsure, use the
powerful elimination method.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.380
Read all the options and kick out
the ones that are obviously wrong.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.790
This is your best friend.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.920
When options look confusingly similar.

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:59.795
For questions about objectives
or beneficiaries, use the

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:01.445
contextual understanding method.

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:05.255
Think about the broader problem
the policy was designed to solve.

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:08.015
The name itself is often a huge clue.

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:13.175
Lastly, there's the keyword identification
method in the question spot key

00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:17.195
terms like financial inclusion or
skill development, and connect them

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:18.665
to the policies you've studied.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.880
It's like finding the right key
for the right lock shortcuts and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.370
smart techniques to be even smarter.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.420
Use these techniques, create
flashcards for quick fact revision.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.550
Draw mind maps for policies.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.470
They are a powerful visual tool.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.830
Make comparative tables to
see the differences between

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.570
similar schemes side by side.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.340
Focus on policies launched or updated
in the last two to three years as

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.260
these are hot topics for examiners.

00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:49.625
Group policies under their ministries
to quickly answer who launched it.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:54.875
Questions regularly take mock tests to
improve your speed and find weak spots.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:06:01.215
And my personal favorite, the
Watson a name strategy, Rahan man.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.385
Salma Sal means crop bema means insurance.

00:06:04.475 --> 00:06:05.795
Its crop insurance.

00:06:05.885 --> 00:06:08.375
The answer is often hiding in plain sight.

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:10.985
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.515
Now let's talk about
the common traps first.

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:15.925
Confusing launch years.

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:21.865
So many policies, so few years, create a
chronological timeline to avoid this mess.

00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:24.295
Next, mixing up ministries.

00:06:24.475 --> 00:06:28.735
Please don't attribute a health scheme
to the finance ministry correction.

00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:30.835
Link each policy to its correct.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.575
No ministry while studying.

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:34.735
Another is misunderstanding.

00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:39.865
Objectives, always focus on the primary
stated goal, not a secondary benefit.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.920
Also watch out for
incorrect beneficiaries.

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.820
A policy might be for farmers
or women, not for everyone.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.090
Correction, pay close
attention to the target group.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.469
People also make the mistake of
ignoring key features, those unique

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.630
components that make a policy different.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.520
Finally, the biggest blunder is relying on
outdated information policies get updated.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.370
Always ensure your study
material is current.

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.560
WH framework summary.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.610
To quickly summarize everything,
let's use the reporters framework.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.710
So what are these policies?

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.099
They are deliberate actions and
decisions by the government.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.420
Why do they exist to address
societal issues and promote growth?

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.870
When are they made continuously
as and when needed?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.280
Where are they applied?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.040
Across all sectors and
regions of the country?

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.330
Who is involved?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.650
The government formulates them and
citizens and businesses benefit from them.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.340
And how are they implemented
through legislative processes,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.810
funding and administrative
machinery fully worked out Examples.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.690
Let's see this in action
example, one question.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:54.250
The Phan PM JDY was launched with
the primary objective of A providing

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.960
affordable housing to urban poor
B, promoting financial inclusion by

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.330
ensuring access to financial services.

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:05.875
C, offering free health insurance to
all citizens below the poverty line.

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:10.855
D. Improving rural road connectivity
across the country understand the

00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:12.925
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:16.975
The question asks for the
primary objective of P-M-J-D-Y.

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:20.875
The name Han means People's
Wealth, which is a huge.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.849
Let's look at the options.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.890
Option A. Housing is for schemes
like BMAY, option C, health

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.200
insurance is for Aman Barrat, option
D. Rural roads is for B-M-G-S-Y.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.210
This leaves option B promoting financial
inclusion by providing access to

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.409
financial services, which perfectly
matches the idea of bringing wealth

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.270
of financial tools to the people.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.650
So the correct answer is
B. Example two question.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.340
Which of the following government
policies focuses on improving

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.870
sanitation and cleanliness across India,
including the construction of toilets?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:03.620
A, Macon, India, B Aman Par C Dal Pension.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.100
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.020
This one is quite direct.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.335
The question is looking for the
policy on sanitation and cleanliness.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.100
Macon India is for manufacturing.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.040
Aman Barrat is for Health AL Pension.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.870
ANA is for Social Security
pensions, but SW Abian literally

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.700
translates to Clean India mission.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.500
It couldn't be more obvious.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.280
It is all about cleanliness,
sanitation, and building toilets.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.440
Option C is the correct answer.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.605
Example three question.

00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:35.775
The Ayush Man.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:41.175
Parana is a flagship scheme launched by
the government to provide a financial

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.945
assistance for higher education.

00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:46.305
B, skill development,
training for unemployed youth.

00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:49.275
C, health coverage to vulnerable families.

00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:52.035
D subsidized food grains to the poor.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.830
Understand the question before.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.390
Moving to explanation here, we need
to know what Aman Parit provides.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.770
Is it for education?

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.310
No.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.900
Is it for skill development?

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:02.470
No.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.120
That would be P-M-K-V-Y.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.470
Is it for food grains?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.010
No.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.510
That's the PDS system.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.400
Aman Parit is the government's massive
health initiative and its main component.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.295
P-M-J-A-Y provides health coverage of up
to five LAC rupees to vulnerable families.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.330
Therefore, option C is the perfect fit.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.320
Thank you.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.675
See you in the next lecture.
