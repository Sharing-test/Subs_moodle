00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.019
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on general Knowledge.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.680
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.280
This is it.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:16.515
Concept explanation, general knowledge,
or GK as we fondly call it in the

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:21.884
context of your exam, is basically
a giant test of are you living on

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:24.255
this planet or did you just arrive?

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.564
It refers to a broad understanding
of various facts and information

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.305
across different domains.

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:35.585
It covers everything from what's
happening in the world right now,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:40.805
which we call current events to static
information about history, geography,

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:46.565
Indian polity, economy, science, and
of course specific knowledge related

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:48.754
to the banking and financial sector.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110
The goal is single to see how aware
you are of the world around you.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.629
It's not about becoming a PhD in
every subject, but having a general

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.519
grasp of important information.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.539
Think of it as knowing a little
bit about a lot of things.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.145
Real world relevance.

00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:11.085
And why is this so important you ask?

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:16.035
Well, general knowledge is incredibly
crucial for banking professionals

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:20.955
because it provides the foundation for
understanding the wider world where

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.235
all financial decisions are made.

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:28.215
It helps in understanding economic
policies and tricky market trends.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:34.075
This awareness enables informed decision
making in complex financial scenarios,

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:36.115
which is a big part of the job.

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:41.185
It also aids in effective communication
with a diverse range of clients.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:45.925
Having this knowledge provides a broader
context for financial discussions,

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:50.304
building your credibility and trust
with both clients and colleagues.

00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:55.315
You'll sound like you know what you're
talking about because you actually will.

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.199
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.520
So what's the recipe for
this GK section in your exam?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.210
Based on typical patterns,
the questions are a mix.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.880
About 40% of the weightage is on current
affairs, which includes national and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.620
international news awards, sports
summits, and government schemes.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.450
Another 30% is dedicated to
banking and financial awareness,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.890
covering banking terms.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.270
RBI functions, financial
institutions and economic concepts.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
This is the core, my friend,
static General Knowledge makes up

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.200
about 20%, which includes history,
geography, Indian polity, science

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.450
books, authors, and important days.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.645
Finally, a miscellaneous 10% is
sprinkled in covering basics of

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.325
computer knowledge and general science.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.380
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.530
Now, for the magical part formulas, I have
to break it to you for general knowledge.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.019
There are no formulas like in mathematics.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.250
Instead, we focus on memory
aids and strategic approaches.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.829
You can create acronyms and mnemonics,
which are short, memorable phrases

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.560
like for the colors of the rainbow.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.019
Another trick is association where you
link new information with something you

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.660
already know, creating a stronger memory.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.424
Flashcards are a classic for a reason.

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:25.204
They are great for quick recall of
facts through spaced repetition.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:31.115
You can also try mind maps to visually
organize information and please use

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:36.095
categorization group similar facts
together like all national parks or

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.935
all recent government appointments
to make them easier to remember.

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:45.245
Finally, the golden rule is repetition
with spacing, review information

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:48.425
at increasing intervals to really
lock it into your long-term memory.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.704
Methods of solving.

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:52.994
All right.

00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:57.494
How do you actually solve these questions
in the exam hall without panicking?

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:01.845
The main game here is recall
and logical elimination.

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:05.415
First, please read the question carefully.

00:04:05.894 --> 00:04:09.075
Look for sneaky keywords,
like not correct or incorrect.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.894
If you know the answer directly,
brilliant, mark it and move on.

00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:19.415
If not, it's time for the
superstar method elimination.

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:24.395
Go through the options one by one
and eliminate the ones you are sure

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.945
are wrong or completely irrelevant.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:31.025
This dramatically increases your
chances of getting it right.

00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:37.235
Sometimes the question itself or the other
options can give you contextual clues.

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:42.950
So be a bit of a detective and as a
last resort, if you've narrowed it down.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.700
Make an educated guess, but
please avoid blind guessing

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.320
if there's negative marking.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.415
That's a trap.

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:55.515
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:59.295
The best one is making daily
news consumption a habit.

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:04.185
Pick a reputable newspaper or a
reliable news app and make it your

00:05:04.185 --> 00:05:09.975
daily companion, focusing on national,
international economic and banking news.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.039
To revise, refer to monthly
current affairs, compilations

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.450
from trusted sources.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.700
Pay extra special attention to
banking specifics like RBI policies,

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.049
banking terminology, recent
mergers and financial schemes.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.640
It's also very smart to analyze previous
year papers to understand frequently

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.680
asked topics and question patterns.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.660
Keep quick revision notes for last
minute review of important facts and

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.600
dates and for a bit of passive learning.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.425
Listen to audio podcasts or
watch video summaries of current

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.185
events during your commute.

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:50.265
It all adds up common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:53.625
Now let's talk about the common pitfalls.

00:05:53.625 --> 00:06:00.224
To avoid a huge mistake is relying solely
on static GK like history and geography,

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:05.174
while ignoring current affairs, which
often forms the largest part of the paper.

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:08.924
Another one is underestimating
banking awareness.

00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:14.294
These financial terms are critical for
a banking exam, so do not skip them.

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.995
A very common error is just
cramming facts without understanding

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:23.015
their context, which leads to
massive confusion during the exam.

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:27.905
Remember, GK requires continuous
revision because facts can

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.795
fade from memory very quickly.

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:32.645
Don't over rely on a single source.

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:37.325
You might Ms. Key information
and be careful not to confuse

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.785
similar names, dates, or schemes.

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:41.945
It happens more often than you think.

00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:44.925
WH framework summary.

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:49.695
So to quickly summarize everything
using a simple framework, let's see.

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:51.645
What is General knowledge?

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:56.805
It's factual information across current
events, static subjects, and banking.

00:06:57.195 --> 00:07:00.585
Why is it needed to assess
your general awareness?

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:04.775
Decision making ability and
understanding of the financial world.

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:10.295
When do you apply it in your daily news
consumption, during exam preparation,

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:12.725
and in professional banking discussions?

00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:18.425
Where is it relevant in your exam, of
course, but also in general conversations

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:21.035
and for understanding economic policies.

00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:22.565
Who benefits from it?

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:27.705
Exam candidates, banking professionals,
and really any informed citizen.

00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:31.785
And how is it acquired through
dedicated reading, sharp

00:07:31.815 --> 00:07:36.195
observation, critical thinking, and
a commitment to continuous learning.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.090
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:45.000
Let's see this in action example one
current affairs question, which country

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.570
recently hosted the G 20 summit in 2023?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.859
A, Brazil, B India, C. South Africa,
D Indonesia understand the question

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:57.414
before moving to explanation.

00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:00.555
Solution, step one.

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:04.215
The question is a straightforward
current affairs query about the

00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:06.945
host of the 2020 3G 20 summit.

00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:10.844
Step two, you just need to
recall your knowledge of major

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:12.585
recent international summits.

00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:15.585
Step three, let's evaluate the options.

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.250
Brazil is set to host in 2024.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.840
India hosted in 2023.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.030
South Africa, hosted the Brick
Summit in 2023, not G 20, and

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.060
Indonesia was the host back in 2022.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.200
Step four, based on a recall,
India is the correct host.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.539
The correct answer is B India.

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:39.794
Example two, banking
and financial awareness.

00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:43.664
Question, what does repo rate
primarily refer to in the

00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:45.555
context of banking in India?

00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:50.445
A. The rate at which commercial banks
lend money to the reserve bank of India.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:55.095
B. The rate at which the Reserve Bank
of India lends money to commercial

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:57.135
banks against government securities.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.480
C, the rate at which commercial
banks lend money to their customers.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.710
D. The rate at which the Reserve
Bank of India borrows money from

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.910
commercial banks understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.760
Solution.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.720
Step one.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.230
The question is asking for the
definition of a repo rate, a

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.300
fundamental monetary policy, Tom?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.340
Step two, let's define it.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.270
The repo rate is the interest rate
at which the central bank are.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.910
RBI lends money to commercial banks.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.460
Step three, analyzing the options.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.740
Option A actually describes
the reverse reper rate.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.829
Option B correctly defines the repo rate,
including the important detail about

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:40.050
it being against government securities.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.850
Option C refers to customer lending
rates, and option D is another way

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.770
of describing the reverse re rate.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.600
Step four, clearly.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.960
Option B is the most accurate
and complete description.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.280
The correct answer is B, the rate
at which the Reserve Bank of India

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.730
lends money to commercial buys
against government securities.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.180
Example three static general knowledge.

00:10:03.675 --> 00:10:10.275
Question the famous Sanchez tpa, a
UNESCO World Heritage Site is located in

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:20.865
which Indian State A Pradesh, B Behar,
C Pradesh, D Maharashtra, understand the

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.145
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.760
Solution, step one.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.670
The question is about the location of a
famous historical site, the Sanchez Stupa.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.310
This is a static GK question.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:41.640
Step two, you need to access your memory
about major heritage sites in India.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.030
Step three, let's look at the options.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.070
U PR has the Taj.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.819
Bihar is famous for both.

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:55.790
Gaa Maia Pradesh is indeed where
the Sanchez Stupa is located, and

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:59.240
Maharashtra has the AA and Elra caves.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.650
By eliminating the others and
confirming our knowledge, we

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.150
land on the correct state.

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:09.050
The correct answer is see pr.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.160
Thank you.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.665
See you in the next lecture.
