Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on international organizations.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.390
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:14.415
So what are these big shot
international organizations are?

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:18.705
They simply put, they're like the
grand housing societies of countries.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:23.325
They are official groups set up
by treaties or international laws

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.545
and have their own legal status.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.805
Mostly countries are the members making
them intergovernmental organizations.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.650
Their main job is to get nations to
cooperate on all the big global headaches.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.360
You know, things like peace and
security, economic growth, human

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.950
rights, and saving the planet.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.410
They are basically the big round tables
where countries can talk, negotiate,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
and take action together on problems
that one country can't solve alone.

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.650
Think of giants like the United Nations,
the World Bank, the IMF, the WTO, and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.985
even regional clubs like the European
Union or asean, real world Relevance.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.265
Now you might wonder why should iCare?

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:11.745
Well, if you are a professional,
understanding these

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.485
organizations is critical.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:18.315
They influence global economic
policies, financial rules, and

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.915
international trade, which directly
affects the business world's

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.045
environment and how we calculate risks.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.795
Knowing about these bodies helps
you understand global financial

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:33.295
stability, big trade deals, and
potential economic shocks that could

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:35.215
affect your work or investments.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:39.535
It's the difference between being
prepared and being caught off guard.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.664
Break down off question types.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.184
Based on patterns from your exam.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.854
The questions about
international organizations

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.015
usually come in a few flavors.

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:54.655
Let's see what the examiners love
to ask about 35% of the time, they

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:58.794
will ask you about an organization's
headquarters or its formation year.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
Another 25% of questions are simple memory
tests on the full forms of acronyms.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
Then with a 20% frequency, they'll
quiz you on the main functions

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.280
or goals of an organization.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.980
Less frequently, but still important.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.040
Are questions about member
countries or the current

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.050
bossman, the Secretary General.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.180
That's about 10% of the time.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:25.405
And finally, another 10% is
dedicated to current affairs.

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.365
Like recent summits, important
reports they released are major

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.670
new projects, formulas, antrix.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:36.855
While there are no magic formulas in
general awareness, we do have some clever

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.255
jugar tricks to remember these facts.

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.075
First, try acronym association.

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:46.995
Make funny connections like for
WHO, the World Health Organization.

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.785
Just imagine a doctor
asking who's healthy.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:53.755
Next group organizations
by their headquarter city.

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:58.255
For Geneva, think of global
things starting with G. It hosts

00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:02.245
W-H-O-I-L-O-W-T-O and more for New York.

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:07.165
It's all about the UN and its major
programs like unicef, Washington

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:09.115
DC is where the big money is.

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:15.595
The World Bank and IMF Paris is for
Culture and economics, UNESCO and OECD.

00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:19.555
You can also link founding years
to major historical events.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.530
Like how many UN bodies popped
up right after World War ii?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.700
Finally group them by their
purpose, economic, health,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.260
environmental, and so on.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.040
Methods of solving.

00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:35.475
To tackle these questions, the main
method is, well, remembering the

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:37.845
facts, but here's a smart process.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:40.935
First, identify keywords in the question.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:45.555
Look for words like headquarters
founded in purpose or full form.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:49.785
Then try to recall the associated
facts you've memorized.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.500
With that information, you can
start to eliminate options.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.670
Even if you're not a hundred percent
sure, knocking out one or two wrong

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.190
choices dramatically increases your odds.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.810
Sometimes the question itself
gives you contextual clues, and for

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.800
the trickiest ones, rely on your
current affairs linkage, connect

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.570
the organization to recent news.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.500
You might have read.

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:15.435
Shortcuts and smart techniques
for smart preparation.

00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:20.115
Use flashcards, make one for each
organization with its name, full

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.245
form headquarters founding here.

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:27.885
Key functions and current head mind maps
are also fantastic for visually connecting

00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:30.315
organizations by region or function.

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.075
Please, my friend, do regular revision.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:37.960
Short, frequent sessions are far better
than one long, painful night of cramming.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.350
Track the news daily to stay up to
date on what these organizations are

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.620
up to, especially the big names like
the Un, W-H-O-I-M-F-G 20, and Brix.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.590
And finally, practice categorization.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.060
Make a list of high priority
organizations like the UN Agencies,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.980
IMF, world Bank, WTO, and regional
groups important to India like

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.800
asean, ands, and focus on them first.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.225
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:10.905
All right, let's talk about the
common traps you must avoid first.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:15.345
Confusing headquarters people often
mix up the headquarters of similar

00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:18.405
sounding bodies like WHO and WTO.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:22.035
Both are in Geneva, but their
jobs are completely different.

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:25.215
Second, relying on outdated information.

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:28.545
Leadership changes, new
initiatives are launched, so

00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:30.405
make sure your facts are fresh.

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:32.565
Third, getting incorrect full forms.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.660
It's easy to misremember
an acronym, so be precise.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.150
Fourth, misunderstanding mandates.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.240
Don't just guess an
organization's role by its name.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.480
For example, the World Bank
doesn't just give loans.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.660
Its main mission is poverty
reduction and development.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.830
And lastly, a common mistake
is ignoring regional bodies.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.200
Don't just focus on global giants.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.460
Regional groups like a SAR and
BIMS Tech are very relevant.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.469
WH framework summary.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.359
So for a quick summary, using our
framework, what are they entities

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:08.640
formed by states for global cooperation.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.710
Why do they exist to tackle transnational
problems and promote collective action?

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.450
When were they formed at different
times, often after major global events?

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.195
Where are they?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.520
Headquartered all over the world
with hubs in Geneva, New York, and

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.740
Washington, dc Who is involved?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.470
Member states and
international civil servants.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.490
And how do they work Through
treaties, policymaking, funding,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.050
and providing technical help.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.060
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.800
Let's try a few questions.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.110
Example, one question.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.860
The headquarters of the World
Health Organization, WHO,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.630
is located in which city?

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.760
A New York, USAB, Geneva,
Switzerland, c Paris, France.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.290
D Vienna, Austria.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.095
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:59.645
The question is straightforward,
asking for the WHO headquarters,

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:01.865
recalling our city grouping trick.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:04.715
We know WHO is a global health body.

00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:09.005
New York is for the un, Paris
for unesco, Vienna, for IAEA.

00:07:09.755 --> 00:07:12.755
The correct association for
global health is Geneva.

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.534
So the answer is be Geneva,
Switzerland, simple.

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:18.885
Example two question.

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:23.055
Which of the following international
organizations primarily focuses

00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:26.805
on regulating international trade
and resolving trade disputes

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:28.185
among its member countries?

00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:34.695
A international monetary fund, IMFB,
world Bank C, world Trade Organization.

00:07:34.724 --> 00:07:38.175
WTOD, United Nations Development Program.

00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:41.955
UNDP understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.700
Here, the key word is international trade.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.470
Let's analyze the options.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.320
The IMF deals with financial stability.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.140
The World Bank focuses
on poverty reduction.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.930
UNDP is about sustainable development.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.850
The World Trade Organization, or
WTO, is the one whose entire mandate

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.690
is about the rules of trade between
nations and settling disputes.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.690
The description fits the WTO perfectly.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.695
The correct answer is c.
Example three question.

00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:15.975
The term bricks refers to an association
of five major emerging national economies.

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:20.594
Which of the following countries
is not a member of Bres A, Brazil,

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:23.865
B Russia, C India, D Indonesia.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.750
Understand the question before.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.250
Moving to explanation, this question
tests your knowledge of the Bris acronym.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.959
BRIS stands for Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa.

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:36.520
Let's check the options.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.500
Brazil, Russia, and India are all
in the name Indonesia, while a major

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.270
emerging economy is not part of the core
Bricks Group, therefore, the country

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.520
that is not a member is Indonesia.

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:51.250
The correct answer is D. Thank you.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.990
See you in the next lecture.
