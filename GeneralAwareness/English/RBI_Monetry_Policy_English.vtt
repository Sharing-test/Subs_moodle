00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.860
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on RBI monetary policy.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.170
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.605
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:18.975
So what is this big deal about the
Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy?

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.744
Think of the RBI as the ultimate
traffic controller for money In

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:28.185
the Indian economy, its main job
is to manage the flow of cash,

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.015
to keep things running smoothly.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:31.575
The two big goals.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.190
One, to keep prices stable,
which is a fancy way of saying

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.420
control inflation so your child
doesn't cost a fortune tomorrow.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.670
And two, to make sure our economy
grows at a healthy, sustainable pace.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.170
How does it do this?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.410
By playing with the cost
and availability of money.

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:54.975
It uses a box of special tools
to control how much money our

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.925
commercial banks have to lend out.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:03.315
This, in turn, affects the interest rates
on your loans and my fixed deposits, and

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.285
that influences the entire economic dance.

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:11.535
It's basically the RBI turning the
money tap up or down to keep the

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:13.845
economy in that perfect sweet spot.

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:16.335
Real world relevance.

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:19.185
Now you might ask, why should I care?

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:24.315
Well, understanding this is super
crucial because it directly messes with

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:26.685
interest rates on loans and deposits.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:31.005
This affects your bank's profits
and all the financial products

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:32.415
you offer your customers.

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:37.215
It gives you the big picture, the
economic weather report that shapes how

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:41.595
banking works and why your customers
make the financial choices they do.

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:46.244
Breakdown of question types
when it comes to your exam.

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.304
Questions on this topic
are not random, my friend.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.845
They follow a pattern
about 40% of the time.

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:56.625
You'll get direct questions on
the tools asking you to define

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.560
something like repo rate or CRR.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:04.985
Then about 30% of questions are objective
based, focusing on the why, like the

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:07.085
policy's role in fighting inflation.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:12.695
Another 20% are impact based questions
which test your what if understanding.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:17.240
For example, what happens if RBI
increases the reverse reper rate.

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:22.565
And finally, a small but important
10% will be on recent policy

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:24.095
changes and current rates.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:26.320
So you have to keep an eye on the news.

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:28.995
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:30.015
Don't worry.

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:32.985
This isn't a math class
with complex formulas.

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.175
It's about understanding ideas.

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.275
Let's break down the key terms.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.165
First is the repo rate.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:44.025
This is the interest rate at which
commercial banks borrow money from the RBI

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:48.975
for short-term needs by giving government
securities promising to buy them back.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.330
Then we have, its opposite
the reverse repo rate.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:57.965
This is the rate at which RBI borrows from
commercial banks again for the short term.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:02.016
Next up is the cash reserve ratio or CRR.

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:06.845
This is a certain percentage of a
bank's total deposits, its net demand

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:13.355
and time liabilities, or NDTL that it
must must keep as cash with the RBI and

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:15.875
no banks earn zero interest on this.

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:20.705
Similar to this is the statutory
liquidity ratio or SLR.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.580
This is another percentage of NDTL
that a bank has to maintain, but

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.900
this time in liquid assets like
cash gold or approved government

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.080
securities, think of CRR and SLR.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.840
As the money the bank
is forced to lock away.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.800
Then there's the marginal
standing facility or MSF.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.200
This is an emergency window for banks
to borrow overnight from the RBI when

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.330
all other banks say no money, sorry.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.870
The MSF rate is usually higher than the
reper rate, like an emergency surcharge.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.190
The bank rate is the rate for long-term
lending from RBI to commercial

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.510
banks without any collateral and is
typically aligned with the MSF rate.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.760
Open market operations or o os are
simply the RBI buying and selling

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.860
government securities in the open market.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.730
Buying injects money,
selling sucks it out simple.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.269
These tools are broadly
categorized into two types.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.610
The ones that affect the total quantity
of money like C-R-R-S-L-R, and repo

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.710
rate are called quantitative tools.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.760
The others, which aim to direct
credit to specific areas like

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.719
moral persuasion or direct action
are known as qualitative tools.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:36.315
Methods of solving for your
general awareness preparation.

00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:39.045
Solving means truly getting the concepts.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:41.085
Here's a systematic way to do it.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:43.425
First, master each instrument.

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:47.805
Understand what each tool is,
why it exists, and how it works.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.860
Second, grasp the cause and
effect chain for every tool.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.570
Think if this increases, what happens
to money supply, bank lending,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.820
interest rates, inflation, and growth.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.950
For instance, if CRR goes up, banks
have less money, lending rates go

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.050
up and inflation might come down.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.950
Third, clearly separate the
quantitative tools which affect the

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.390
whole economy from the qualitative
ones, which target specific sectors.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.920
Fourth, always link the tool back
to the RBI's main goals of price,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.540
stability, and economic growth.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
Finally, and this is
crucial, stay up to date.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.130
Follow the RBI's, bimonthly policy
announcements to know the current

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.400
rates and the official stance,
whether it's accommodative,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.170
neutral, or in a withdrawal mode.

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.979
Shortcuts and smart techniques
to make life easier.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.630
Here are some smart tricks.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.409
Remember, repo as a
repurchase option for banks.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.969
For reverse repo.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.909
Think RBI receives money from banks,
CRR and SLR are simply mandatory

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:52.739
reserves that banks cannot lend.

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:54.515
To control inflation.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.344
The RBI does tightening.

00:05:56.555 --> 00:06:00.185
It increases rates to reduce
money supply, and make borrowing

00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.135
costly to promote growth.

00:06:02.284 --> 00:06:04.265
It does easing or loosening.

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:08.344
It cuts rates to increase money
supply and make borrowing cheaper.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:13.265
Think of MSF as the emergency borrowing
window for banks in a tight spot

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:17.525
and consider the bank rate as the
traditional long-term lending rate.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.180
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.630
Let's talk about the common
potholes people fall into.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.920
A classic mistake is confusing
repo and reverse repo.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.030
Just remember repo is when
banks borrow from RBI.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.420
Reverse repo is when
RBI borrows from banks.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.440
Another common mix up is CRR versus SLR.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.880
Both are reserves.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.210
Yes.

00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:45.055
But CRR is cash with the RBI.

00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:48.925
While SLR is liquid assets
the bank keeps with itself.

00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:54.835
Also don't think monetary policy is
the only hero saving the economy fiscal

00:06:54.925 --> 00:06:59.365
policy, which is the government spending
and taxes is its powerful partner.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.180
A very important point is that policy
changes don't work like a switch.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.810
There's a time lag before you see
the full effect on the economy.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.450
Finally, don't just look at the rates.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.880
Pay attention to the stance of the policy.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.600
Is it accommodative neutral
or signaling a tightening?

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.575
W Edge Framework summary.

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:24.525
So to summarize this entire thing
in a W Edge framework, what is it?

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:29.354
It's the RBI's master strategy to
control money, supply and credit.

00:07:29.684 --> 00:07:34.275
Why does it exist to achieve big
goals like price stability, economic

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:36.195
growth, and financial stability?

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.544
When is it reviewed?

00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:41.205
It is announced bimonthly by
the monetary policy committee.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:42.645
Where is it applied?

00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:45.585
Across the entire Indian financial system.

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:46.905
Who is the boss?

00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:52.305
It's implemented by the RBI through
its monetary Policy committee or MPC.

00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:53.985
And how do they do it?

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:58.035
By adjusting key rates, reserve
requirements, and conducting

00:07:58.065 --> 00:07:59.535
open market operations.

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:02.295
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.635
Example, one question.

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:08.715
Which of the following is the rate at
which commercial banks borrow money

00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:11.205
from the Reserve Bank of India, RBI?

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:14.865
By selling their securities
with an agreement to repurchase

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:15.975
them at a future date?

00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:17.985
A reverse rep rate.

00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:19.635
B, bank rate.

00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:23.565
C. Rerate D. Marginal standing facility.

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:27.615
MSF understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.460
Solution.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.869
Let's break this down.

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:33.870
Step one is to see what
the question is asking.

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:38.640
It's about commercial banks borrowing
from the RBI by selling securities

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.110
with a repurchase agreement.

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:42.900
Step two, we recall our definitions.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:47.880
The definition of rep rate is precisely
this, the rate at which banks borrow

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.079
from the RBI against securities
with a promise to repurchase them.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.275
So the answer is clearly C. The
correct answer is C repo rate.

00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:00.315
Example two question.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:05.415
If the reserve Bank of India, RBI
decides to increase the cash reserve

00:09:05.415 --> 00:09:10.305
ratio, CRR, what is the likely impact
on the money supply in the economy?

00:09:10.605 --> 00:09:12.855
A, it'll increase the money supply.

00:09:13.155 --> 00:09:15.465
B, it'll decrease the money supply.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:18.555
C, it'll have no impact
on the money supply.

00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:22.395
D. It'll first increase and
then decrease the money supply.

00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:25.515
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:27.105
All right.

00:09:27.255 --> 00:09:28.214
Let's solve this.

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:30.290
Step one, what is CRR?

00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:34.755
It's the cash banks must park with
the RBI, which they cannot lend.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:35.714
Step two.

00:09:35.865 --> 00:09:38.175
What happens if CRR increases?

00:09:38.475 --> 00:09:40.485
Banks have to keep more money aside?

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.844
Meaning they have less money
available to give out as loans.

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:48.584
Step three, what's the impact when
banks lend less the creation of

00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:50.175
credit in the economy shrinks.

00:09:50.545 --> 00:09:54.115
This directly leads to a decrease
in the overall money supply.

00:09:54.445 --> 00:09:55.825
It's like tightening the money.

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:56.155
Tap.

00:09:56.545 --> 00:10:00.010
The correct answer is B, it'll
decrease the money supply.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.030
Example three question.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.900
Which committee is responsible
for deciding the benchmark policy

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.699
interest rates in India, such as the
re rate a, financial Stability and

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:17.670
development council, F-S-D-C-B, nti,
AO C, monetary Policy Committee,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.699
MPCD, Indian Banks Association.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.600
IBA understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:26.235
Solution.

00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:27.705
Let's analyze this.

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:31.335
The question asks, who sets
the main policy rates in India?

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:32.955
Let's look at the options.

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:36.945
FSDC deals with financial
stability, not rate setting.

00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:41.955
Nthe IO is a government think tank for
long-term policy, not monetary rates.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:44.175
IBA is just a banker's club.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.880
This leaves the Monetary
Policy Committee or MPC.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.500
This committee was specifically
created under the RBI Act for the exact

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.430
