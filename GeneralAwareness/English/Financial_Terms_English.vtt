00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial terms.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
Let's decode this concept like detectives

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.860
concept explanation.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:17.115
Financial terms, my friend, are the secret
language of the economy and banking.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.995
Understanding them is your superpower.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:25.035
These words describe everything
about money, markets and investments.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.035
Let's start with the big ones first.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:28.935
Inflation.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:34.305
This is when the price of everything
from your samosa to your petrol goes

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.975
up and your money's power goes down.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.010
Basically your a hundred rupe note
feels like it went on a crash Diet.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.200
Next is deflation.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.780
It's the complete opposite of inflation.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.460
Prices are falling and suddenly
your money feels like a bodybuilder.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.870
It can buy more.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.360
While this sounds fantastic, prolonged
deflation can be a real party pooper for

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.180
the economy as it discourages spending.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.365
Then we have the repo rate.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:08.405
This is the interest rate at which our
big boss, the Reserve Bank of India,

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:10.505
lends money to commercial banks.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.825
Think of the RBI as the
ultimate money lender for banks.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.035
It's a key tool to
control the money supply.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.735
The opposite is the reverse repo rate.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:24.125
This is the rate at which
the RBI borrows money.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:28.105
From the commercial banks, when
banks have too much cash lying

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:32.095
around, they can pocket it with
the RBI and earn some interest.

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:35.485
This helps suck out extra
money from the system.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:42.835
Now, the cash reserve ratio or CRR, this
is a specific percentage of a bank's total

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.655
deposits that it must keep with the RBI.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.745
This is the look, but don't touch money.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:50.725
Banks can't use it for lending.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.220
Similar, but different is the
statutory liquidity ratio or SLR.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.290
This is also a percentage of a bank's
deposits, but the bank gets to keep this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.320
money with itself in the form of liquid
assets like cash gold or government bonds.

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:11.415
We often hear about gross
domestic product or GDP.

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:16.665
This is the total value of all finished
goods and services made within a

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:19.005
country's borders in a specific time.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:23.415
It's like the country's annual report
card showing its economic health.

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:28.815
A term that gives bankers nightmares
is non-performing asset, or NPA.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.745
An NPA is a loan where the
borrower has stopped paying the

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.265
principal or interest for 90 days.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:40.565
It's the loan that went on a vacation
and forgot to come back to pay its bills.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:44.165
Fiscal policy is about the
government's own wallet.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:49.565
It refers to the government's decisions on
its spending and how much tax it collects.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:51.755
It's used to steer the economy.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:53.885
And finally, monetary policy.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.420
This refers to the actions of
a central bank like our RBI

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.280
to manage money and credit.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.670
This is the RBI playing
DJ with the economy.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.430
Using tools like interest rates, CRR
and SLR to get the rhythm just right.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.120
Real world relevance.

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:14.925
Why should you care?

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:19.605
Well, understanding these terms
directly impacts decision making In

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:24.435
banking, for instance, inflation helps
in figuring out the real value of

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.685
money and influences lending rates.

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:31.815
The repo rate directly affects how much
it costs banks to get funds, which then

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.760
decides the interest rates on your loans.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:38.385
The cash reserve ratio determines
how much money banks have to lend

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.695
out affecting credit in the economy.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:45.525
Managing non-performing assets is the
core banking function for survival.

00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:50.355
The gross domestic product gives a big
picture view of the economy, helping

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:55.185
banks plan for the future, and fiscal
policy impacts government borrowing,

00:03:55.275 --> 00:03:57.465
which can influence the entire market.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:04.155
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:06.795
Questions on these terms
are quite predictable.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.695
About 40% are straight up
definition based questions.

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:16.305
Another 30% are implication or
impact questions asking What happens

00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:21.195
if a rate changes around 15% are
linked to full form questions for

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:23.530
abbreviations like CRR or NPA.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.789
About 10% are linked to current
affairs, and a small 5% might ask

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.799
you to compare two similar terms.

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:35.715
Formulas and tricks for these terms.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:37.065
Forget complex math.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:42.135
It's all about concepts and clever
tricks for repo versus reverse repo.

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:46.155
Think of it this way, repo
is when banks need to receive

00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:48.135
power or money from the RBI.

00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:50.145
Reverse is the opposite.

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:57.525
The RBI takes money from banks for CRR
versus SLR, remember, CRR is cash with the

00:04:57.525 --> 00:04:59.835
reserve bank, which the bank can't use.

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:05.775
SLR is self liquid reserves, which the
bank holds itself and for inflation,

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:07.755
just remember the classic line.

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:10.365
Too much money chasing too few goods.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:13.875
Methods of solving.

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.085
Solving these questions is
a game of understanding.

00:05:17.414 --> 00:05:22.425
For definition questions, just recall
the exact meaning for impact questions,

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:27.104
understand the terms function, analyze
the change, and trace the consequences.

00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:30.854
For full form questions, well,
you just have to memorize them.

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:35.385
And for comparison questions quickly
list the key differences in your head.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.420
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.040
Want some pro tips?

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.650
Use contextual clues in the question.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.170
Always use the elimination strategy.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.500
Getting rid of obviously
wrong answers is a huge help.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.120
Focus on keywords and definitions
like overdue for 90 days.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.710
For an NPA, and remember, many
terms are tools of the RBI.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.940
If you understand the RBI's goals
like fighting inflation, you'll

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.130
understand why it uses these tools.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.080
Lastly, a quick scan of
financial news daily will make

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.789
these terms your best friends.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.120
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.320
Now, for the banana peels on
the floor, a common mistake is

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.450
confusing repo and reverse repo.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.270
Just remember who is giving money to whom.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.660
Another is mixing up CRR and SLR.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.310
One is with RBI.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.260
The other is with the bank itself.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.340
A big misconception is thinking
deflation is always good.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.120
It's not.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.770
It can cripple an economy.

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:44.155
Also don't forget, the magic number for
an NPA is 90 days, not 60 or one 20.

00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:48.445
And remember, GDP measures
production, not the total wealth

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:49.630
or happiness of a country.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.820
WH framework summary.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.040
So let's quickly summarize.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.900
What are financial terms?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.020
They are the vocabulary
for money and business.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.380
Why do we learn them to
manage money effectively?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.820
When do we use them?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.680
When saving, investing, or even just
reading the news, where do we find them?

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.840
Everywhere from banks to apps.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.340
Who needs to know them?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.060
Everyone.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.590
My friend, including you.

00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:21.945
And how do we master them through examples
and practice just like we are doing now.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.784
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:28.065
Let's tackle some real questions.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.344
Example, one question.

00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:35.775
What does CRR stand for in the context of
banking and what is its primary purpose?

00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:40.455
A credit rating ratio to assess
the credit worthiness of borrowers.

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.614
B. Cash reserve ratio.

00:07:42.825 --> 00:07:46.190
The percentage of deposits
banks must keep with the RBI.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.350
C Capital requirement ratio to
ensure banks have sufficient capital

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.060
D, current rate of return, the
profitability of bank investments.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.660
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.670
All right, let's break it down.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.420
The question wants the full
form of CRR and its purpose.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.130
You know, CRR stands for cash
reserve ratio that eliminates

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.590
options A, C, and D right away.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.720
Its purpose is the percentage of deposits
that banks must keep with the RBI.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.210
Option B says exactly that.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.710
It's a perfect match.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.000
Answer B.

00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:28.020
Example two question.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.730
If the Reserve Bank of India RBI
increases the repo rate, what is

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.600
the most likely immediate effect on
commercial banks and the economy?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.350
A commercial banks will find
it cheaper to borrow from RBI

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.150
leading to lower lending rates.

00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:46.290
B. Commercial banks will find it
more expensive to borrow from RBI

00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:48.060
leading to higher lending rates.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.780
See, commercial banks will
increase their deposits with RBI

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.425
reducing the reverse reper rate.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:58.364
D commercial banks will have more
liquidity leading to increased investment.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.970
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.160
All right, let's dissect this.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.150
The question asks about the effect
of an increase in the repo rate.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.680
What is the repo rate?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.949
It's the rate at which
banks borrow from the RBI.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.230
So if the rate increases, borrowing from
the RBI becomes more expensive for banks.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:21.005
What will banks do?

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:25.565
They will pass on this higher cost
to us, the customers, by increasing

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.135
their own lending rates, on home
loans, car loans, and so on.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:30.815
Now look at the options.

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:34.625
Option A says, borrowing
becomes cheaper, which is wrong.

00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:38.345
Option B says, borrowing
becomes more expensive, leading

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.545
to higher lending rates.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:41.825
This is exactly what we figured out.

00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:45.125
Option C and D are
incorrect and unrelated.

00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:46.265
Answer B.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.460
Example three question.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.150
A loan is classified as a
non-performing asset, NPA.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.290
If the principle or interest payment
remains overdue for a specific

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.180
period, what is this period?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:06.090
A 30 days B, 60 days C,
90 days, D one 20 days.

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:10.965
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:11.775
All right.

00:10:11.954 --> 00:10:13.995
This one is a direct memory test.

00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:18.855
The question asks for the specific
time after which a loan becomes an NPA.

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:24.314
The standard definition, a crucial detail
to remember is that a loan turns into an

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:27.405
NPA if the payment is overdue for 90 days.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.380
It's a fixed number, so
let's check the options.

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:34.495
30, 60 and one 20 days are all incorrect.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.105
The magic number is 90 answer.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:37.615
See.

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:38.605
Thank you.

00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:40.194
See you in the next lecture.
