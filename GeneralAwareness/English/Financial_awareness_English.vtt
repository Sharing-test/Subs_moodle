00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.260
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on financial awareness.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.870
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.830
So what is this big sounding term?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.239
Financial awareness.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
Think of it simply as being in
the know about money matters.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
It is the knowledge and understanding
of all sorts of financial concepts,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.230
products, services, and markets.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.710
It's about having the
ability to make smart.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.280
Informed decisions about your own
money, investments, credit, and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.440
your overall financial health For a
banking professional, this awareness

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.990
expands like a good DOA batter to
cover the entire economic environment,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.790
how financial institutions work,
the rules they must follow, and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.665
government policies that stir the part.

00:00:55.464 --> 00:01:00.205
This includes everything from
banking, operations, monetary policy,

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:04.700
and capital markets to insurance
and various financial instruments.

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:07.695
Real world relevance.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:12.195
Now, why should you care
first for customer advisory?

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:17.024
A circle based officer must understand
different financial products

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:19.065
to effectively guide customers.

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:22.095
You can't help someone
with their banking needs.

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:23.774
If you are clueless yourself.

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:25.905
Then comes risk management.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:30.795
Knowing financial concepts helps
in sporting and reducing risks

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:35.805
tied to lending and other banking
operations, which is a very big deal.

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:38.985
It also leads to operational efficiency.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:44.325
Understanding financial processes
is absolutely key for making banking

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:46.635
operations smoother and more efficient.

00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.075
Think less paper, more profit.

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.035
Also, regulatory compliance
is non-negotiable.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:57.804
Financial awareness ensures you
are following all banking laws and

00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:02.905
regulations, which helps avoid massive
penalties and keeps the public's trust.

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:05.000
Next, the economic impact.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.449
This knowledge allows a CBO to
analyze market trends and figure

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:15.040
out how they might affect the bank's
performance and even customer behavior.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.380
Finally, product development.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.550
A solid grasp of financial
instruments helps in giving good

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.135
feedback for creating new and useful
banking products for everyone.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.675
Breakdown of question types in your exam.

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:34.335
Questions on financial
awareness come in a few flavors.

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:40.185
About 25% are on definitions and
terminology, like asking what

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:43.245
is CRR or what does NPA mean?

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:50.025
Another 20% cover the functions and roles
of institutions such as what is the RBI's

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:52.995
main job, or who regulates mutual funds.

00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:57.715
Government schemes and policies
make up about 15% of questions.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.165
For instance, which scheme
is for financial inclusion?

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:05.515
Abbreviations and acronyms
are also a good 15%.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:09.625
Asking you to expand
things like SWIFT or IFSC.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:15.325
Current financial news and updates
account for another 15% covering recent

00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:17.875
changes in policy rates or bank mergers.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.829
Lastly, about 10% of questions are on the
types of banking and financial products,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.929
like the difference between savings and
current accounts, key facts and concepts.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.359
Let's talk about some must knows.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.579
First, the RBI's role.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.989
The Reserve Bank of India is our
country's central bank, the big boss.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:44.144
It's responsible for monetary policy
regulating banks and issuing our currency.

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:48.975
We have different types of banks, like
commercial banks, which include public

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:53.804
sector, private sector, and foreign
banks, as well as cooperative banks,

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:56.565
payments banks, and small finance banks.

00:03:56.984 --> 00:03:59.535
You must also know the key policy rates.

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:03.494
The repo rate is the rate
at which RBI lends to banks.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.870
The reverse report rate is the opposite.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.980
The rate at which RBI borrows from banks,
then their CRR or cash reserve ratio,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.640
and SLR, the statutory liquidity ratio.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.290
When it comes to financial instruments,
you have everything from your basic

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.090
savings and current accounts, fixed
and recurring deposits to loans, mutual

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.940
funds, shares, bonds, and insurance.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.815
And who keeps everyone in
line, the regulatory bodies.

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:37.555
The RBI looks after banks, sebi
handles the capital markets.

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.135
I-R-D-A-I manages insurance.

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:42.805
And P-F-R-D-A is for pension funds.

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:48.745
A very important concept is financial
inclusion, which means making financial

00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:52.765
services available to people who
don't have them through things like

00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:56.784
no frills accounts, mobile banking,
and direct benefit transfers.

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.340
Methods of solving.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.039
When you see a question, don't panic.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.380
Use these methods first.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.059
Keyword identification.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.219
Read the question carefully and spot
the main financial term or institution.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:12.900
This helps you focus.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.419
Then do some option analysis.

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:20.580
Look at each option and see how well it
fits with the keyword you identified.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.469
The elimination method
is your best friend.

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.979
When you're stuck, start by
throwing out the options that are

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.380
obviously wrong or don't make sense.

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.580
This seriously increases your
chances for trickier questions.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.320
Use contextual reasoning.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.190
Think about how these financial
ideas work in the real world

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.989
to figure out the best answer.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.270
And of course, sometimes you just have
to rely on recall of facts directly

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.729
remembering the definitions and details.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.729
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be a little clever.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.719
Use acronym association for abbreviations.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.130
Link the first letter to a related word,
for example, F in IFSC is for financial.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.370
Easy peasy.

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:11.945
Also try categorization mentally
group things like investment

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:15.695
products or regulators to
recall their features quickly.

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:21.935
The odd one out strategy works wonders
if a question asks for an exception,

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:26.044
scan the options for the one that
doesn't belong with the others.

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:29.200
A great technique is
current affairs linkage.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.340
Many static questions.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.599
Have a current angle.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.280
Connect the concept to any recent
news you've read, and finally

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.289
focus on the core function.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.280
When asked about an institution,
remember its main job.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.770
This helps tell it apart from others.

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:49.575
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.845
Please, please avoid
these common blunders.

00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:55.215
A classic is confusing.

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:58.005
RBI's role with the Ministry of Finance.

00:06:58.395 --> 00:07:00.555
RBI is the monetary authority.

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.625
The ministry is the fiscal one.

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:06.104
Don't mix repo rate and reverse repo rate.

00:07:06.705 --> 00:07:08.505
Repo is RBI lending.

00:07:08.864 --> 00:07:11.114
Reverse repo is RBI Borrowing.

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:14.055
Also understand NPA properly.

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:17.805
A non-performing asset
isn't just any bad loan.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:22.664
It's a loan overdue by a
specific period, usually 90 days.

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:27.315
Be careful about incorrectly
identifying regulatory bodies.

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:29.640
Sebi does not regulate insurance.

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:31.440
That's ida's job.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.420
A huge mistake is ignoring recent updates.

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:38.090
Financial awareness is not static.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.070
Old facts get outdated.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.900
And finally, a silly but common
error is overlooking words like

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.090
not or accept in questions.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.440
Read carefully.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.120
WH framework summary.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.020
So to put it all in a
nutshell, what is it?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.340
It is knowledge of financial
concepts, products and markets.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.930
Why is it important?

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.670
It is absolutely essential for
making smart financial decisions

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.560
and for effective banking.

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:09.150
When is it applied?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.760
It's used in personal finance, banking
roles, and even in economic policy.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.140
Where do you see it?

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:21.985
In financial markets, banks, regulatory
bodies, and even in your own home.

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:23.245
Who is involved?

00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:27.835
Everyone, individuals, businesses,
banks, and the government.

00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:29.635
And how do we understand it?

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:35.065
By learning about economic indicators,
financial tools and banking rules.

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:37.405
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:38.665
Let's try a question.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:41.824
Example, one question.

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:46.864
Which of the following is the primary
function of the Reserve Bank of India?

00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:50.645
A. Managing public debt for
the government of India.

00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:54.005
B. Issuing currency, notes and coins.

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.734
C. Regulating the stock market.

00:08:57.064 --> 00:09:02.224
D. Providing direct loans to
individuals Understand the question

00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:04.055
before moving to explanation.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:05.410
All right.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.030
The question asks for the primary,
the main function of the RBI.

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:11.920
Let's look at the options.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.260
A, managing public debt.

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:15.069
Yes.

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:18.310
RBI does this, but is it the primary role?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.010
Let's see.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.530
B issuing currency.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.740
This is a fundamental exclusive job of
a central bank, only RBI can do this

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.350
in India except for the one rupe note.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.450
This looks like a strong candidate
C regulating the stock market.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.820
Nope, that's the job of sebi.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.620
So this is incorrect.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.100
D. Providing direct loans to individuals.

00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:45.305
That's what commercial banks are for.

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:49.055
RBI is a banker's bank,
not a person's bank.

00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:53.735
So comparing all options,
issuing currency is the most

00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:55.954
fundamental and primary function.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:00.944
Correct answer is option
B. Example two question.

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:05.324
What is the full form of NPA
in the context of banking?

00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:07.875
A national payment account?

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:15.435
B, non-performing asset C. New public
agreement D. Net profit analysis.

00:10:15.795 --> 00:10:18.589
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:22.135
This one is a direct terminology question.

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:25.825
It asks for the full
form of NPA in banking.

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:28.375
Let's check the options option.

00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:34.255
A national payment account and option
C, new public agreement are not

00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:40.765
standard banking terms for NPA option
D. Net profit analysis is a financial

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.465
term, but not what NPA stands for.

00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:49.564
Option B. Non-performing asset is a
very important and widely used term in

00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:52.055
banking for loans that have gone bad.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:58.324
This is the one correct answer is
option B, example three question.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:02.405
Which of the following government
schemes is primarily aimed at

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.505
promoting financial inclusion?

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:09.365
By providing access to banking
services to the unbanked population.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:27.104
A-F-Y-B-J-D-Y-C-A-Y-D pension
a PY, understand the question

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.545
before moving to explanation.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.310
Here the keywords are financial
inclusion and access to banking.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.770
For the unbanked, let's evaluate.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.140
Option A-P-M-F-B-Y is for crop
insurance, not our answer.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.950
Option C-P-M-A-Y is
for affordable housing.

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:48.355
Not about banking access.

00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:51.655
Option DAPY is a pension scheme.

00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:56.334
It's part of financial security, but
not the primary scheme for getting

00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:58.225
