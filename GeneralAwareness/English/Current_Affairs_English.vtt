00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.840
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on current affairs.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.390
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
So what exactly is this big deal
about Current affairs array?

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.490
It's just a fancy term for all the recent
and significant events happening around

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.800
the globe, nationally and internationally,
which are relevant to a specific period.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:34.330
For your exam, it covers all the
hot news from politics, economy,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.670
sports science and technology awards,
government schemes, you name it.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.530
The entire goal is to check your
general awareness and see if you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.940
actually understand the contemporary
world, especially the bits that are

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.070
important to the financial sector.

00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:54.855
Real world relevance, crucial, my friend.

00:00:55.184 --> 00:00:59.955
These events directly impact the
financial world and policy decisions,

00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:05.565
sometimes hitting like a surprise, googly,
staying updated helps you understand

00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:11.025
economic trends and regulatory changes,
which is absolutely vital for informed

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:13.455
decision making in a professional role.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.230
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.910
All right, let's speak into the
question papers blueprint based

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.830
on past patterns, a solid 20% of
questions are about appointments,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.140
both national and international.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.910
Basically, who got the new Connor
office in a major organization?

00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:37.085
Next, about 15% is on awards and honors.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:40.804
This includes everything from
the Padma Awards and Nobel

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.695
Prizes to sports trophies.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:49.354
A massive chunk of full 25% is dedicated
to government schemes and policies.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:53.914
You must know the new initiatives and
objectives of government programs,

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:58.475
especially those touching finance,
agriculture, and social welfare.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.350
The economy itself is a big player at 20%
covering RBI policies, bigshot mergers

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.080
and economic indicators like GDP and
Inflation, national and International

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.750
Summits or events take up another 10%.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.430
Asking about recent conferences
and major global get together, the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.320
last 10% is a tasty mixed grill
of sports, books and authors,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.930
obituaries and science and technology.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.510
A little bit of everything
to keep you on your toes.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:31.845
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:37.365
Now, current affairs doesn't have a
mathematical formula, but we have our own

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:40.095
Jugar formulas for effective retention.

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:43.755
First and foremost is building
a daily reading habit.

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:47.265
Consistency is the secret
masala, believe me.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.460
Read from reliable
sources every single day.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.040
The next trick is categorization.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.070
Don't just dump all the
news into your brain.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.210
Group it by topic like
appointments, sports or economy.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
It's like organizing your wardrobe
for those tricky names and dates.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.290
Use mnemonics and associations.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.705
Create funny acronyms or silly
mental images to remember details.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:18.065
Finally, the bold rule, the revision
cycle, you absolutely must implement a

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:23.285
regular revision cycle daily, weekly,
and monthly to reinforce your memory.

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:28.540
Otherwise, that information will vanish
faster than free samosas at a party.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.200
Methods of solving.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.859
So how do you tackle these
questions in the exam hall?

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.890
First, always read the question carefully.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.680
Understand exactly what is being asked,
a name, a date, a location, or a purpose.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.890
Next, identify the
keywords in the question.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.130
These are the hooks that will
help you pull the relevant

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.720
information from your memory.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.049
Then try to recall the
information you have stored.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.890
If you are unsure, use the
brilliant elimination method.

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:03.455
Get rid of the obviously incorrect
options to narrow down your choices.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:08.735
This dramatically improves your chances,
and sometimes a little contextual

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:13.235
understanding of the broader event can
help you deduce the correct answer even

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:14.900
if you don't recall the specific fact.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:19.605
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart cuts.

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:23.985
Instead of reading lengthy articles
over and over, make short notes,

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:28.095
condense the key facts into simple
bullet points of flashcards.

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:33.165
You could also use mind maps to visually
connect related current affairs topics.

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:34.700
It's fantastic for recall.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.849
Get into the habit of attempting
daily quizzes to test your

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.860
knowledge and spot your weak areas.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.070
And a fantastic technique
is group discussions.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.300
Discussing and even arguing about
current events with your friends can

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.020
really help you remember facts and
understand different perspectives.

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.810
A pro tip, always focus on economy,
prioritize news directly related to the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.570
financial sector as it holds more weight.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.510
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.370
Now listen carefully.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.980
Let's talk about the
common traps to avoid.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.250
The biggest mistake is
not revising regularly.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.330
Information from current affairs
is extremely volatile and needs

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.800
frequent revision to stick.

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:20.684
Another blunder is over
focusing on irrelevant news.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:24.854
Don't waste your precious time
on political drama or sensational

00:05:24.854 --> 00:05:27.135
news that has no exam relevance.

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:30.465
Also, don't ignore the static GK linkages.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:35.414
A new appointment might require knowing
the organization's headquarters you see.

00:05:35.775 --> 00:05:39.495
A very common problem is
memorizing without understanding.

00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:43.485
Simply mugging up facts without
context makes recall during

00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:45.285
the exam almost impossible.

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:48.705
Lastly, please stop
relying on a single source.

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:52.635
Limiting yourself to one news
portal might lead to a biased

00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:54.105
or incomplete understanding.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.165
WH framework summary.

00:05:57.465 --> 00:06:01.095
To wrap up this GaN session,
let's use the WH framework.

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:02.715
So what is it?

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:06.405
Recent and significant events
across various domains.

00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:10.995
Why will you need it to assess your
general awareness and understanding of

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.245
issues relevant to the financial sector?

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:16.935
When are we talking about events
from the last six to eight

00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:20.535
months with a strong focus on the
most recent three, four months?

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:22.195
Where do these events happen?

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:27.295
Both national and international, with a
particular emphasis on India and global

00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:29.605
financial developments, who is involved?

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:33.505
All the important individuals,
organizations, and governments.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:35.095
And how do you master it?

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:39.535
By diligently reading newspapers,
magazines, online portals, and

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:40.720
current affairs compilations.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.545
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:47.835
All right, let's solve a
few example, one question.

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:52.335
Who among the following was recently
appointed as the new chairman of the

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.525
Securities and Exchange Board of India?

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:56.685
Sebi A, AGI.

00:06:56.895 --> 00:07:00.405
B, mother B Pull, Butch C UK Sinha.

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:05.175
D. G Mahalingam understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.950
Okay, let's analyze this.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.110
The question asks for the new chairman of
sebi, a very important recent appointment.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.270
AGI and UK Sinha were former
chairman, so A and C are out.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.750
G Mahalingam is a whole time
member, not the chairman.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.100
This leaves mother B Puri Butch,
who was indeed appointed as the new

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.260
chairperson, a landmark appointment.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.090
So the correct answer is
B. Example two question.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.850
The PM Kisan SAM scheme provides financial
assistance to eligible pharma families.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.910
What is the annual amount
provided under the scheme?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.910
A 4,000 B 6,000 C 8,000 D 10,000?

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.970
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.870
Okay, this one is about a
famous government scheme.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.780
You need to recall the
specific financial detail.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.590
The correct annual assistance
for pm Kisan is 6,000.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.220
It's paid in three equal
installments of 2000 each.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.410
A detail that helps confirm the total.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.960
All other options are incorrect amounts.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.760
Thus, the correct answer is
B. Example three question.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.140
Which city recently hosted
the G 20 summit in 2023?

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.360
A. Rome B, Bali C. New Delhi d Osaka.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.045
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:31.755
This question tests your knowledge
of a major international summit

00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:33.975
from a specific year 2023.

00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:37.424
This was a huge event for
India, so it's a must know.

00:08:37.695 --> 00:08:45.435
Let's use elimination Rome hosted in 2021,
Bali in 2022 and Osaka way back in 2019.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:50.685
This clearly shows that New Delhi was
the host for the G 20 summit in 2023.

00:08:50.805 --> 00:08:52.065
The answer is see.

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:53.355
Thank you.

00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:55.005
See you in the next lecture.
