00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on headquarters.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.740
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.640
Explanation.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.970
So what on earth is a headquarters?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.430
Think of it as the main control room,
the brain, the administrative nerve

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.190
center of any big short organization.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.200
Company or institution.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.370
It's the location where all the
important decisions are made.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.190
The top bosses sit and all the key
operations are managed for your exam.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.180
Remembering the headquarters of
various national and international

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.910
organizations, banks and regulatory
bodies is absolutely critical because

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.135
they love asking these factual questions.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.795
It's like free marks if
you just remember them.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:54.365
Real world relevance
and why should you care?

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:58.775
Well, knowing the headquarters of
financial institutions helps you

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:03.215
understand their global footprint and
where their power is concentrated.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:07.765
This is super important for dealing
with any of their operations.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:12.535
It also gives you a clearer picture
of the regulatory world and the big

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:16.705
players who govern the financial
sector, which directly impacts how

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:19.045
we understand compliance and policy.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:21.505
Top six, relevant headquarters.

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:23.725
Let's talk about the top six.

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:25.405
You absolutely must know.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.429
First, our very own
reserve, bank of India, RBI.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.380
Its headquarters in Mumbai is crucial
to remember as it's the central bank

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.270
controlling everything in India.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.360
Next up is Nabard also comfortably settled
in Mumbai, which tells you about its big

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.000
role in agriculture and rural finance.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.430
Then there's sebi, another Mumbai
resident highlighting its job as the main

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.590
watchdog for the Indian stock market.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.960
Moving to the world stage, we have
the International Monetary Fund IMF,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.220
whose Washington DC headquarters
reflects its global mission of

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.900
keeping money matters stable.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.130
Its neighbor.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.150
The World Bank is also in
Washington dc underscoring its

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.979
goal of fighting poverty worldwide.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.140
And finally, the Asian Development
Bank, A DB, located in Manila,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.580
Philippines, which emphasizes its
focus on developing Asia and the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.640
Pacific breakdown of question types.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.870
Now, how will they try to trick
you with headquarters questions in

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.520
the general awareness section, it's
mainly a memory game, so don't worry.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.350
Based on past papers.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.670
Here are the formats.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:39.715
About 60% of the time,
it'll be a direct question.

00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:44.515
Just as straightforward, where is
the headquarters of X, Y, Z located?

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:48.745
For example, where is the headquarters
of the World Bank located?

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:52.375
Around 25% of the time you'll see a match.

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:57.084
The following question, they'll give you
two columns, one with organizations and

00:02:57.084 --> 00:03:02.334
the other with cities, and you have to
play matchmaker, for instance, match RBI

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:05.185
with Mumbai and IMF with Washington, DC.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.280
Then for about 10% of
questions, it's an odd one out.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.450
They'll give you a list and you have
to find the one that doesn't belong.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.560
Maybe because all others are
headquartered in the same city, for

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.970
example, which of the following does
not have its headquarters in Geneva?

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.100
And finally, the rarest type at 5%
is the statement based question.

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.089
They'll give you a statement about
an organization and its headquarters

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.250
and ask if it's true or false.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:35.195
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:39.305
Since this topic is all about
facts, there are no mathematical

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:41.255
formulas, thank goodness, right?

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:46.565
Instead, we focus on smart memory
aids, or as we call it, jugar.

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:52.085
You can use acronyms of phrases
by creating memorable lines or try

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:57.005
association linking an organization to
a feature of its city, like thinking

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.225
Geneva for global organizations.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.380
A very powerful method is categorization.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:06.850
Just group, all organizations
by their headquarter city, all

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.480
Geneva ones together, all New
York ones, all Mumbai ones.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.950
Visual memory can also help use
maps to mentally place these HQs.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.300
And if you're the creative type, making
up short rhymes or songs can really make

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.330
the information stick methods of solving.

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.840
So when a question appears,
how do you tackle it?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.390
The best approach is direct recall.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.349
If you see the question and the
answer pops into your head, brilliant.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.580
That's the fastest way.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.140
If your brain is taking a little
nap, use the elimination strategy.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.950
Look at the options, and kick out
the ones you know for sure are wrong.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.310
This seriously increases your
chances of getting it right.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.680
You can also do a categorical check if
you've memorized organizations by city.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.920
Mentally run through your list
for each city in the options.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.620
Sometimes keyword association helps.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.400
The name itself might give a
clue, like Asian Development

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.110
Bank points towards Asia.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.760
And rarely you might find contextual
clues in the question, especially

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.810
in the match, the following types,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
Here are some quick tricks for W
organizations in Washington dc.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.300
Remember that Financial giants like
the World Bank and its partner in

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.580
crime, the IMF are located there.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.659
Be careful.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.159
The World Health Organization is in
Geneva, but the money people, world

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.169
Bank and IMF are in Washington, DC for
organizations with international and

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.789
words like label health or trade, your
first guest should be Geneva, Switzerland.

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.110
Think I-L-O-W-H-O-W-T-O
for development banks.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.400
Grouping them helps.

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.650
Asian Development Bank is in Manila.

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:49.245
African Development Bank in
Aja and the new development

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:51.675
bank in Shanghai and back home.

00:05:51.825 --> 00:05:55.635
Remember that India's financial
capital Mumbai hosts the big

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:58.575
regulators like RBI, sebi and Nabard.

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:02.685
Don't forget that IRDA is
in hydro bard, not Mumbai.

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:08.235
Using flashcards and spaced repetition
are also fantastic techniques to burn this

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.365
information into your long-term memory.

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:13.025
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:15.335
All right, friends, listen carefully.

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.105
This is where people trip up.

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:22.265
Avoid confusing similar names like mixing
up the World Bank in Washington with

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.785
the World Health Organization in Geneva.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:29.465
Always check for outdated information
while rare things can change.

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:31.385
So use current study materials.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.825
Don't just focus on global giants
and ignore the regional banks.

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:37.205
That's a rookie mistake.

00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:39.895
And please don't just guess wildly.

00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:40.675
If you're unsure.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:43.465
Use elimination to avoid negative marking.

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:48.835
Lastly, a common error is focusing too
much on international bodies and not

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:53.185
giving enough love to our important Indian
institutions and their headquarters.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.200
WH framework summary.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.410
So to wrap it all up,
what is a headquarters?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.630
It's the main administrative office.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.650
Why is it important for centralized
decision making and control?

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.510
When is it relevant to understand an
organization's history and current base?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.175
Where is it the specific city where
central functions are located?

00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:15.025
Who operates from there?

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:18.205
Governments, institutions,
and their key employees.

00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:20.185
And how does this knowledge help you?

00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:23.515
It helps in understanding
organizational structure and

00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:26.395
influence fully worked out examples.

00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:28.045
Let's solve a few questions.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.205
Example, one question.

00:07:30.355 --> 00:07:34.345
The headquarters of the Reserve
Bank of India, RBI, is located

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:35.620
in which of the following cities.

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:42.535
A new Delhi b Mumbai, CTA D
Chennai understand the question

00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:44.155
before moving to explanation.

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:44.845
Okay.

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:49.465
The question, once the HQ of RBI
are Central Bank, your mind should

00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:51.655
immediately go to the financial capital.

00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:57.085
While it was initially in Coleta, it
permanently moved to Mumbai in 1937.

00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:01.345
New Delhi is the political capital,
and Chennai is an important city,

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:03.325
but Mumbai is the correct answer.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.335
Answer Be Mumbai.

00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:07.445
Example two question.

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:11.674
Which of the following international
organizations has its headquarters in

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:17.135
Geneva, Switzerland, a international
monetary fund, IMFB, world Health

00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:22.534
Organization, WHOC, world Bank D.
United Nations Children's Fund, unicef.

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:24.935
Understand the question before.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:29.855
Moving to explanation here, we need to
find the organization based in Geneva.

00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:31.445
Let's check the options.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:35.944
IMF is in Washington, DC World
Bank is also in Washington dc.

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:37.955
UNICEF is in New York City.

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:42.275
That leaves the World Health
Organization WHO, which as per our

00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:44.194
little trick, is indeed in Geneva.

00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:47.985
Answer B, world Health Organization, WHO.

00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:50.084
Example three question.

00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:55.305
The new development bank, NDB, formerly
known as the Brix Development Bank, has

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.495
its headquarters located in which city?

00:08:57.795 --> 00:08:59.385
A. New Delhi, India.

00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:03.855
B Moscow, Russia, C
Shanghai, China, D. Brasilia.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.339
Brasilia.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.310
Understand the question before.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.570
Moving to explanation.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.900
This question is about
the NDB, the Bricks Bank.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.980
It was set up to fund projects in
bricks and other emerging economies.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.210
While all the options are cities in
Brix nations, you must remember the

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.230
specific location the headquarters
was decided to be in Shanghai,

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.140
China, answer, see Shanghai, China.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.070
Thank you.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.720
See you in the next lecture.
