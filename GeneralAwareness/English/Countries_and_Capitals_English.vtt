00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.530
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on countries and capitals.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.230
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:12.525
All right.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.285
Countries and capitals
sound simple, right?

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.244
It's the fundamental knowledge
of sovereign nations and their

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:21.585
respective official capital cities.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.175
But don't be fooled.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.825
This topic is a core component of
general awareness sections in your

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:32.894
exam designed to test your global,
geographical and political knowledge.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.379
The whole game involves memorizing
the correct capital for each

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.449
country, which, and listen carefully
is often quite distinct from

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.670
its largest or most famous city.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
Understanding this is absolutely
crucial for making sense of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
international relations, current
affairs, and the whole global

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.879
economic scene, real world relevance.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
Now you might ask, why is this so
vital for a banking professional?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.540
Well, think about it.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.950
This knowledge enables a quick
grasp of international financial

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.170
news and global market trends.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.370
You'll be processing foreign
transactions and need to identify

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.470
key economic hubs efficiently.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.390
For global financial news, you'll need
to understand reports on international

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.280
markets without scratching your head.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.550
For international banking,
you'll be identifying

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.350
locations for foreign exchange.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.620
It also helps in trade
relations by helping you

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.600
recognize key trading partners.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
You can follow geopolitical events
and understand global political shifts

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.040
better during client interactions.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
You can smoothly assist clients with
their international banking needs.

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:49.935
And most importantly, for risk
assessment, you can better evaluate the

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.335
economic stability of different regions.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:57.315
See, not just for quizzes,
breakdown of question types.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.700
So how will they try to trap you in
your exam based on past patterns?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.280
The questions usually
come in a few flavors.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.100
About 45% of the time you'll face a
direct question from country to capital.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.190
For example, what is the capital of Japan?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.420
Another 30% of the time they
flip it around with a direct

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.010
question from capital to country.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.250
Like Tokyo is the
capital of which country.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.390
Then with a 15% frequency,
you might get a match.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.810
The following question, they'll
give you two columns, one with

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.920
countries and the other with capitals,
and you have to play matchmaker.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.200
And for the remaining 10%, they'll try to
catch you off guard with an identify the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.060
incorrect pair question where you have
to find the one country capital pair that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.635
is just plain wrong formulas and tricks.

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:54.045
Now since there are no mathematical
formulas here, we have to rely on

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:55.845
clever memorization techniques.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.615
You could use monic devices, which
means creating catchy phrases.

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:04.725
For instance, something like
Nice in Ghana to remember.

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.615
Nigeria's Capital, Abuja.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:10.155
It's not a world class example,
but you get the idea right.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.650
Another trick is association where you
link a country's name or a capital's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.630
name to something familiar, like saying
Paris is France's romance capital.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.310
You can also try categorization,
which means grouping countries by

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.450
continent or region, learn all the
African countries and their capitals,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.280
then move to the next continent.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.870
Flashcards are an old school, but gold
standard method for active recall.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:41.045
And don't forget visual learning use maps
to actually see where these countries

00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:44.674
and capitals are methods of solving.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:50.055
To really get this stuff to stick in
your brain, follow these methods first.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:53.085
A systematic study by
continent is your best bet.

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:58.095
Begin with one continent, say Asia,
then Africa, Europe, and so on.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:01.065
Master one before you jump
to the next continent.

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:05.235
Next, engage in repetitive
recall practice regularly.

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.280
Test yourself without
peeking at the answers.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.790
Start by listing countries
and writing their capitals.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.500
Then do it the other way around.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.109
Also, utilize blank maps.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.370
Get some blank political maps, and fill
in the countries and their capitals.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.950
This works wonders for
your spatial memory.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.360
Try some audio visual reinforcement
by watching educational videos

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.979
or listening to audio lessons.

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.180
And please focus on high frequency
regions, prioritize countries you hear

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.830
about in the news like G seven nations,
Brix, countries, and major economies.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.310
Lastly, always update
information regularly.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.900
Capitals can change.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.909
Don't get caught with old information,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:53.205
For some smart work, try sound alike
grouping group together, countries and

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:55.305
capitals that have similar sounding names.

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:57.525
Practice capital first recall.

00:04:57.825 --> 00:05:01.035
Instead of always thinking
country to capital, reverse it.

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:06.015
This builds a stronger two-way connection
in your mind in multiple choice questions.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.625
The elimination strategy
is your best friend.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.970
If you don't know the answer, get rid of
the options you know are definitely wrong.

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.780
Pay extra attention and
focus on unique names.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.719
Unusual ones are often exam favorites.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.950
Finally, do daily micro sessions,
just five to 10 minutes.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.700
Each day is far more effective
than one long, painful session.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.940
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:32.354
All right.

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:34.244
Let's talk about the common traps.

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:38.025
The biggest one is confusing the
capital with the largest city.

00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:42.375
So many people think Sydney is
Australia's capital, not Canberra

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:46.335
or New York for the USA instead of
Washington DC a classic mistake.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.429
Another is using outdated information.

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:51.870
Capitals do change.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.260
Myanmar's capital shifted
from Yangon to nip pda.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.289
Relying on an old textbook
could cost you marks.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.159
Be careful with similar sounding
names like mixing up ARAF for

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.469
Ghana with Algiers for Algeria.

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:08.820
Misspellings can also be an issue, though
less so in multiple choice formats.

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:12.935
And a very common oversight
is ignoring smaller countries.

00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:15.034
Don't just focus on the big players.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.695
Those small island nations
can and do appear in exams.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.215
W framework summary.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.604
So to put it all in a
nutshell, what is this topic?

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:30.224
It's simply the knowledge of sovereign
nations and their official capital cities.

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:31.935
And why is it important?

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:35.715
It's essential for your general
awareness, for understanding global

00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:38.385
affairs and for async competitive exams.

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:39.825
When do we apply it?

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:45.525
When analyzing international news, current
events or solving exam questions, where

00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:50.745
is it relevant in geography, international
relations, economics, and your exams?

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:51.255
Of course.

00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:52.515
Who is this for?

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:54.645
Any friend preparing for an exam.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:59.025
Professionals in international fields and
anyone seeking solid general knowledge

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.525
and how do we learn it through smart
memorization techniques, geographical

00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:05.985
study, and lots of regular revision.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.670
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.910
Example, one question.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.280
What is the capital city of Canada?

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.450
A New York, B Ottava, C Toronto, D
Vancouver, understand the question

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.040
before moving to explanation.

00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:28.005
Step one is to understand the
question asks for Canada's capital.

00:07:28.245 --> 00:07:31.215
Step two, you recall your
North American geography.

00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:33.735
Step three, you evaluate the options.

00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:35.715
New York, that's in the USA.

00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:40.784
So nope, Ottava sounds very familiar
as the capital Toronto, that's

00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:43.094
Canada's largest city, a common trap.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:47.025
Vancouver, another major Canadian
city, but not the capital.

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:49.755
So in step four, we lock in our answer.

00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:51.855
Answer b Ottava.

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:55.335
Example two question.

00:07:55.485 --> 00:07:58.155
Which of the following
pairs is correctly matched?

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:02.355
A, Australia, Sydney, B
Brazil, Rio De Janeiro.

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.034
C. India, Mumbai.

00:08:04.094 --> 00:08:05.685
D Germany, Berlin.

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:08.909
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.960
Here we need to find the one correct pair.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
Let's analyze each one.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.100
Option A, Australia, Sydney.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.360
Ah, the classic trap, the
capital is Canara, so incorrect.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.820
Option B, Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, another
famous city, but the capital is Brasilia.

00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:30.195
Incorrect Option C, India Mumbai.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:34.935
Mumbai is the financial capital shop,
but the official capital is New Delhi.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:35.805
Incorrect.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.025
This leaves option D, Germany.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:38.534
Berlin.

00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:39.255
Yes.

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:41.895
Berlin is absolutely
the capital of Germany.

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:43.965
This one is correct answer.

00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:47.775
D Germany, Berlin example three.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:52.185
Question, if the capital of
Egypt is Cairo, what is the

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:53.715
capital of South Africa?

00:08:53.985 --> 00:09:00.495
A. Nairobi B Pretoria, c Abuja,
DCRA understand the question

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:01.930
before moving to explanation.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.080
I. The first part about Egypt is just
some extra info to set the scene.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.840
The real question is about
South Africa's capital.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.910
Now South Africa is tricky.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.320
It has three capitals.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.100
Pretoria is the executive one,
so let's look at the options.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.200
Nairobi is Kenya's Capital.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.370
Pretoria is one of South Africa's
capitals, and the most common answer

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.530
in these exams, Abuja is Nigeria's
Capital, and Accra is Ghana's Capital.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.380
So the best fit here is clearly Pretoria.

00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:33.555
Answer be Pretoria.

00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:35.175
Thank you.

00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:36.560
See you in the next lecture.
