00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on banking regulations and compliance.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.230
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.080
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.350
So what is this big
sounding topic all about?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.740
Think of it as the ultimate
rule book for banks.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.530
Banking, regulations and compliance are
basically the laws, rules, and guidelines

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
that all financial institutions,
especially our banks, must follow.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.710
It's not just for show.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
These rules are put in place by
the big bosses like the Central

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.380
bank and government bodies.

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:38.785
And why do they do it?

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:44.305
To make sure banks operate safely,
fairly and transparently so they don't

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:49.135
do any hira ferry with our money,
the main goals are to protect us.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:53.515
The customers maintain the stability
of the entire financial system,

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:57.595
prevent illegal activities like
money laundering, and ensure

00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:00.355
healthy competition and compliance.

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.105
That just means the banks are
actually following these rules.

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.869
They need to have systems in place to
check on themselves and report back.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.250
It covers everything from how they
lend you money and manage risks

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.179
to how they protect your data and
show their report card of financial

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.550
health, real world relevance.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.880
Now you might ask why should iCare ra?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.429
It's incredibly important
in the real world.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:30.805
First, it's all about risk management,
which ensures banks handle their money

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.385
smartly, protecting the money we deposit.

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:38.785
Then there's customer protection, which
acts like a guardian guaranteeing you are

00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:41.425
treated fairly and with full transparency.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:45.925
It also promotes financial
stability, which prevents a domino

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:49.585
effect where one failing bank
brings down the entire system.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.690
A very crucial part is anti-money
laundering or a ML, which helps

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.260
stop illegal money flows and
the financing of terrorism.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.720
Good regulations also lead to operational
efficiency, making banking processes

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.120
standardized, secure, and smooth.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.310
Finally, it ensures market integrity,
which stops any single bank from

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.090
becoming a monopoly and keeps the
competition fair for everyone.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.920
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.780
Based on past papers, questions
on this topic for your exam tend

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.790
to follow a few familiar patterns.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.260
About 40% of the time you'll
face direct fact-based questions.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.910
These are straightforward questions
asking for a specific act committee

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.045
date or definition, like what is the
primary function of the RB. Then about

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:41.625
30% are application-based questions.

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:45.765
Here they'll give you a small
scenario, a little story, and you

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.655
have to apply a regulation to it.

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:52.785
For instance, which regulation would
govern a bank's capital adequacy, your

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:58.454
favorite type, full form, or abbreviation
Questions make up about 15% asking

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:00.855
what acronyms like KYC stand for.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.250
A smaller 10% are the tricky.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.760
Which of the following is not
questions where you have to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.470
spot the incorrect statement?

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.260
And lastly, a tiny 5% are numerical or
limit based questions, which test your

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.760
knowledge of specific percentages or
limits, like what is the current CRR

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.300
rate formulas and tricks for this topic?

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.240
There are no mathematical
formulas in the usual sense.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.830
But there are key values and concepts
you must treat like formulas.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.140
First, master the acronyms.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.460
You must memorize the full forms
of all relevant acronyms like RB

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.560
I-S-E-B-I-I-R-D-A-I-F-E-M-A-P-M-L-A-K-Y,
C-A-M-L-C-R-R-S-L-R, repo.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.930
The entire alphabet soup of banking.

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:52.565
Second, always keep track of the key
rates announced by the RBI like the repo.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:57.545
Reverse repo, MSF and the
reserve ratios like CRR and SLR.

00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:00.875
Third, associate important acts and years.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.345
Create a mental link.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:08.350
For example, RBI ACT was 1934 and
the Banking Regulation Act was 1949.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.320
Fourth connect major committees and
recommendations like linking the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.880
basal accords to capital adequacy,
and finally be very clear on

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.920
regulatory bodies and their purview.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.979
Know exactly which body
regulates which area.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.849
It's simple.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.050
RBI for banks, SEBI for
capital markets and so on.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.820
Methods of solving.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.625
So how do you tackle these
questions in the exam hall?

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:36.445
The first and most obvious
is the directory call method.

00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:40.765
If you've memorized the fact, you
just select the answer, easy peasy.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.885
When you're not sure, use
the elimination method.

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:46.825
This is a lifesaver in
multiple choice questions.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:51.715
Look at the options and eliminate the
ones that are clearly wrong or unrelated.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:55.875
For scenario-based questions, use
the contextual understanding method,

00:04:56.205 --> 00:05:00.255
understand the situation described,
and then identify which regulation

00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:02.354
or principle fits the context best.

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:05.655
When you face questions with
very similar concepts, the

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.575
comparative analysis method is key.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.755
Compare their features and
differences to pick the right one.

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:14.865
And for those questions with numbers,
the Numerical value association

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:18.794
method helps you link that specific
value to the correct banking term.

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:23.735
Shortcuts and smart techniques want some
smart techniques to make life easier.

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:24.785
Of course you do.

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.945
First try acronym grouping.

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:31.055
Put all similar acronyms, like all
the monetary policy tools in one

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:32.585
group to memorize them together.

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:34.655
Next, timeline creation.

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:38.760
Make a simple mental or physical
timeline of important banking acts

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.835
and reforms to remember their order.

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:44.975
Mind mapping is another great tool
to visually connect regulatory

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:46.895
bodies with the areas they control.

00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:51.325
Use flashcards for quick recall
of definitions, acts, and numbers.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.055
Most importantly, focus on why.

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:57.985
If you understand why a regulation
was created, remembering the

00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:02.065
what and how becomes much
easier and a non-negotiable tip.

00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:03.505
A daily news scan.

00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:07.705
Regularly check financial news
for RBI Updates as questions are

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:09.265
often linked to current affairs.

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.820
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.120
All right, let's talk about
the common traps to avoid.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.000
A big one is confusing regulatory bodies.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.849
Friends often mix up the roles of
R-B-I-S-E-B-I-I-R-D-A-I and P-F-R-D-A.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.630
Just remember RBI is the king of
the jungle for commercial banks.

00:06:28.344 --> 00:06:31.255
Another silly mistake is
getting the incorrect years

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:32.965
or dates for important acts.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:37.795
Please double check these many Also
misunderstand basal accords confusing

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:40.405
the details of basal one, two, and three.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:44.575
Remember, each one builds on
the last with stricter rules and

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:48.505
for heaven's sake, do not start
interchanging monetary policy tools.

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:53.515
Repo rate is not the same as reverse
repo rate, and CRR is not SLR.

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:56.355
Also don't just study the original act.

00:06:56.535 --> 00:07:00.045
Be aware of any significant amendments
that have changed the rules.

00:07:00.344 --> 00:07:03.555
The biggest mistake of all is
overlooking current affairs.

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:05.925
Banking regulations are not static.

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:06.705
They change.

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:08.445
So you must stay updated.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.605
WH framework summary.

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:13.005
Let's quickly summarize
everything with our WH framework.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.525
So what is it?

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.555
Simply put the rules and
guidelines for banks.

00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:22.755
Why does it exist To protect
our money, the economy, and

00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:24.375
to stop illegal activities.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.715
When is it applied continuously?

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:29.415
Every single day in
all banking operations.

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:34.515
Where is it applicable to all financial
institutions in the country and even

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:36.495
globally through international agreements?

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:37.665
Who is involved?

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:42.405
Regulators like the RBI create the
rules and all banks must follow them.

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:44.985
And how is it enforced
Through laws, guidelines.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:50.885
Regular checks, audits, and strong
enforcement fully worked out examples.

00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:53.075
Let's go through some examples.

00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:55.655
Example, one question.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:08:01.115
Which of the following acts primarily
governs the functioning and regulation of

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:06.425
commercial banks in India, including their
licensing, management, and operations?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:14.850
A Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 B.
Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.740
C. Banking Regulation Act 1949 D.
Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.890
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.445
The question asks for the mean
act that governs commercial banks.

00:08:31.295 --> 00:08:36.125
The RBI ACT of 1934 is
about the RBI's own powers.

00:08:36.575 --> 00:08:42.665
The Foreign Exchange Management Act,
or FEMA is for Forex and the Prevention

00:08:42.665 --> 00:08:47.855
of Money Laundering Act is specifically
for a ML. The Banking Regulation Act

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:53.165
of 1949 is the one that provides the
complete framework for regulating banks

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.895
in India from licensing to operations.

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:59.825
So the correct answer is C example two.

00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:04.685
Question, what is the primary
objective of the Basel accords in

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:06.815
the context of international banking?

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:10.265
A, to promote financial
inclusion worldwide.

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:15.665
B, to establish a common framework for
capital adequacy requirements for banks.

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:19.235
See to regulate foreign
exchange markets globally.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.370
D to prevent cyber fraud in digital
banking, understand the question

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.079
before moving to explanation.

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:28.780
The keyword here is Basel accords.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.890
While financial inclusion and
cybersecurity are important, they

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.719
are not the main point of Basel.

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:39.219
These accords were specifically
created to ensure banks have enough

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:41.890
capital to absorb unexpected losses.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.090
It's all about capital adequacy.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.650
Therefore, the primary objective
is to establish a common framework

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.390
For this, the correct answer
is B example three question.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.650
Which of the following is an
anti-money laundering or a ML

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.120
measure that requires banks to verify
the identity of their customers?

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:08.610
A statutory liquidity ratio,
or SLRB, cash reserve ratio, or

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.790
CRRC, know your customer norms.

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:16.589
D, open market operations, or
OMO understand the question

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:18.300
before moving to explanation.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.770
The question is about an A ML
measure for identity verification.

00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:27.870
SLR and CRR are monetary policy
tools that deal with bank reserves.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.540
Open market operations or OMO are about
managing liquidity in the economy.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.930
None of these have anything
to do with customer identity.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.460
Know your customer or KYC is
the process where banks must

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.150
verify who their customers are
to prevent illegal activities.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.080
This directly answers the question,
the correct answer is see.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.190
Thank you.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.720
See you in the next lecture.
