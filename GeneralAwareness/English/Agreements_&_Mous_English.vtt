00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on agreements and MOUs.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.310
Think of this as a cheat
code for understanding this

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.710
concept, concept explanation.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.110
All right, let's break this down.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.780
Think of agreements and memorandum
of understanding or MOUs as formal

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.770
documents that show two or more
parties are on the same page.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.450
These parties could be anyone,
countries, big companies, even

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.710
individuals with big plans.

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:31.235
First up, an agreement.

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.695
This one is serious business, my friend.

00:00:33.964 --> 00:00:38.075
It's a legally binding document,
meaning if someone backs out,

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:39.635
you can take them to court.

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:43.265
It creates obligations
that the law can enforce.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:48.125
Agreements are like the final episode
of a long negotiated TV series.

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:53.315
They come after a lot of talks and
are signed only when everyone agrees

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.445
on every single little detail.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:59.644
Then we have the memorandum of
understanding the famous MOU.

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:03.154
This is the cooler, more
casual cousin of the agreement.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:06.905
It's less formal and
usually not legally binding.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.965
It's more like a public
declaration of friendship.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.965
A we intend to work
together, kind of document.

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:18.905
It's sets the stage for future talks, or
outlines a joint project before the heavy

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.274
legally binding agreement is drafted.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.399
While you can't sue over
an MOU, it carries a lot of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.960
political and moral weight.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.550
It builds trust and is the first
step towards deeper cooperation.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.470
Both are super important in everything
from international relations to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.169
technology, helping to build partnerships.

00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:40.885
Real world relevance.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:44.395
Now, why should you a future
banking professional care

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:45.805
about all this paperwork?

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:50.665
Because these collaborations directly
shape economic policies, trade

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:55.765
relationships, and the very rules that
affect the banking sector, they influence

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:59.755
foreign investments, international
trade, finance, and the overall

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.035
financial stability of the country.

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:05.545
Knowing about them is crucial
for making smart decisions.

00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:10.105
Let's look at the key areas for
international trade and finance.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:14.455
These MOUs and agreements create
new trade routes and investment

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:18.775
opportunities, which directly impacts
a bank's day-to-day operations.

00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:24.115
When it comes to regulatory harmonization,
cross-border agreements can standardize

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:28.750
financial rules, which means changes
in compliance and procedures for banks.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.054
For economic development.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:35.465
When countries sign deals for big
infrastructure projects, it opens

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:39.815
up a floodgate of new lending and
financing opportunities for banks.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:44.734
In the world of technological
cooperation, MOUs in tech can lead to

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:50.075
amazing advancements in digital banking,
cybersecurity, and all things FinTech.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.170
When it comes to strategic partnerships,
agreements with foreign banks

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.940
can help a bank expand its global
footprint and offer more services.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.000
And finally, for risk assessment,
geopolitical agreements or disagreements

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.670
can affect a country's risk profile,
currency stability, and market volatility.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.020
These are all critical factors
for a bank's risk management team.

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:21.704
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:24.435
Questions on this topic
are quite specific.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:29.804
About 30% of the time they'll ask
who signed the agreement, or MOU.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:34.480
For example, India recently signed
an MOU with which country for

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.480
cooperation in renewable energy.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.920
Then about 25% of the time, they focus
on what the purpose was like the X, Y,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.100
Z agreement aims to achieve what around
20% of questions might be about when it

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.960
was signed, especially for historically
significant or very recent deals.

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:58.665
A smaller 15% is about
where it was signed.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:04.575
For instance, the recent G 20 declaration
was signed in which city, and for

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:09.734
the really diligent friend, about 10%
of questions will dig into specific

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:12.315
clauses or details of a major treaty.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.179
Key facts and memory aids.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.849
So how do you remember all this?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.260
First categorize everything
group agreements by sector,

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.380
defense, trade, tech, environment.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.900
It makes recalls so much easier.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.030
Next, use keywords.

00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:36.835
Associate terms with agreements like
logistics exchange with LMOA or climate

00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:38.604
change with the Paris Agreement.

00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:41.125
Also, learn your acronyms.

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:43.765
Bricks, ASEAN, SEO.

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:47.484
Knowing these helps you quickly
identify who's involved.

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.554
A very important tip, recent focus.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:55.325
Pay most attention to agreements
signed in the last six to 12 months.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:59.164
And for your exam,
India's role is priority.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.974
If India is a signatory,
it's a high priority topic.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.505
Finally, understand if it's
bilateral between two countries or

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.664
multilateral involving many countries.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.960
Approach to answering questions.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.750
When a question pops up, don't panic.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.860
First, read the question carefully
to see if it's asking about

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.710
parties, purpose, date, or location.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.250
Then identify keywords,
names of agreements.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.780
Countries or sectors, this will help
you recall associated information.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.340
The best trick is to eliminate
options, rule out the obviously

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.680
wrong if you're stuck between a few.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.220
Try to focus on specifics and recall the
most precise detail you can, and sometimes

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.410
it helps to contextualize by thinking
about the broader geopolitical situation.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.875
Quick recall strategies to
make this information stick.

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.275
Make daily news reading a habit.

00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:00.935
Focus on international
relations and economic news.

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:05.285
In papers like the Hindu or
Indian Express, refer to monthly

00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:08.975
compilations, which often have
a dedicated section for this.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:14.675
You can even make flashcards agreement
name on one side, details on the other.

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:20.025
Or if you are visual draw mind maps,
connecting countries to their agreements.

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:22.965
But the ultimate secret is repetition.

00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:28.245
Revise your list of important agreements
regularly to keep it fresh in your mind.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.390
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.420
Now let's talk about the
common traps to avoid.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.290
A big one is confusing
MOUs with agreements.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.880
Remember, one is non-binding,
the other is legally enforceable.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.430
Don't misremember parties involved.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.210
Attributing a deal to the wrong
country is a silly mistake.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.340
Be careful not to confuse the incorrect
purpose of one agreement with another.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.410
Relying on outdated information
is another classic error.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.600
Current affairs means current.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.940
Finally, don't ignore context or
overlook minor details as questions can

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.580
sometimes hinge on a very specific point.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.680
WH framework summary.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.710
So to sum it all up, what are these?

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.700
They are formal documents for mutual
understanding or legal obligation.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.490
Why do they exist to foster
cooperation and define partnerships?

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.450
When are they signed to
formalize intent or commitment?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.609
Where between countries, organizations,
and businesses all over the world?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.900
Who signs them?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.919
Governments, ministries,
corporations, and other entities.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.299
And how are they created through
negotiation, drafting, signing,

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:45.349
and sometimes ratification
fully worked out examples?

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.240
Let's try a few questions.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.220
Example one, India recently signed an MOU
with which country for cooperation in the

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.530
field of digital public infrastructure.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:03.060
DPIA, United States B Japan, C
Armenia, d Germany, understand the

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.310
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.090
Okay.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.080
The key here is digital
public infrastructure or DPI.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.610
India is pushing its DPI stack
like UPI and Aha globally.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.560
While we have tech cooperation with
the US and Germany and Japan is a key

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.540
partner, the most prominent recent
MOU, specifically on DPI was signed

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.800
with Armenia, India is expanding
ties with countries like Armenia.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.130
And this MOU was signed in October, 2023.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.560
So the fact points directly to
Armenia, correct answer c Armenia.

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.985
Example two, the Chahar port Agreement.

00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:44.795
A significant infrastructure
project for India primarily aims

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:48.815
to enhance connectivity with
which region A, Southeast Asia

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:51.305
B, central Asia, and Afghanistan.

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:55.985
C East Africa, d. European
Union understand the question

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:57.635
before moving to explanation.

00:08:57.984 --> 00:09:00.625
The key word here is Jabba Port Agreement.

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:05.244
This is a very famous strategic
project for India located in Iran.

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:07.074
Why is it so strategic?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:12.505
Because it allows India to bypass Pakistan
to get access to Afghanistan and the

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.275
resource rich central relation countries.

00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:18.845
So options like Southeast
Asia, east Africa, or the

00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:20.824
EU are not the primary goal.

00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:24.485
The direct strategic objective
is connectivity to Central

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:26.045
Asia and Afghanistan.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:26.675
Correct?

00:09:26.675 --> 00:09:29.795
Answer B, central Asia and Afghanistan.

00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:31.025
Example three.

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:36.694
India recently signed an MOU with which
country for cooperation in the field

00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:39.365
of agriculture and allied sectors.

00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:41.045
A Israel.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:48.250
B, Fiji, C Brazil, D United
Kingdom understand the question

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.965
before moving to explanation.

00:09:51.795 --> 00:09:56.895
The question is about a recent MOU
in agriculture and allied sectors.

00:09:57.405 --> 00:10:00.824
Agriculture is a key area
of cooperation for India.

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:05.594
While we have strong agricultural
ties with Israel and cooperation

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:10.094
with Brazil and the uk, the question
asks about a recent development.

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:14.055
India has been strengthening its
relationship with Pacific Island

00:10:14.055 --> 00:10:20.355
Nations and in February, 2023 during our
external affairs ministers visit and.

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:24.375
OU assigned specifically
with Fiji on cooperation in

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.625
agriculture and allied sectors.

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:31.545
This makes it the most accurate answer
among the choices correct answer.

00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:32.895
Be Fiji.

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:33.795
Thank you.

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:35.385
See you in the next lecture.
