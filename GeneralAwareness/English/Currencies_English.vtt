00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on currencies.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.970
We are about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
with this tutorial concept explanation.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.605
So what is this thing called currency?

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:18.975
Think of it as the money system.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.155
The coins and bank notes
that a country uses.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.975
It's the official tool for everything.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:29.835
It's our medium of exchange for
buying that plate of biani, a unit of

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:35.625
account, to know exactly how much that
biani costs and a store of value so

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.114
you can save up for more biani later.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:39.195
Simple, right.

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.215
Now, currencies come in a few flavors.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:45.555
First, we have fiat currency.

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:47.325
This is the king today.

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:52.545
Its value isn't backed by gold or
silver, but by a government's order.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:57.315
And our collective trust in the
big boss, the central bank, the

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:02.145
Indian Rupe, the US dollar, the
Euro, all are based on distrust.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.245
Next is commodity money.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.420
This is the old school hero.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.790
Its value comes from the material.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
It's made of like gold, silver,
or even salt back in the day.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.090
It's valuable on its own.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.580
Finally, there's cryptocurrency.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.740
The new digital kit on the block.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.900
Think Bitcoin or Ethereum.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520
It's a virtual currency using
fancy cryptography for security

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.110
and doesn't need a central bank.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.230
While it's getting all the headlines
for your exam, the main focus is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.480
still on our good old Fiat currencies.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.460
Real world relevance.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.320
Why should you care?

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.789
Well, if you are a professional,
especially in banking, this is your

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.750
bread and butter, you'll be dealing
with foreign exchange transactions,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.190
financing international trade, and
managing foreign currency reserves.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.900
Understanding currencies is the key
to how banks help the world trade

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.360
and manage massive financial risks.

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:05.985
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns from your exam.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.565
The questions you'll face
are quite predictable.

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:13.515
About 40% of them are a simple
matchmaking game, which currency

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:14.805
belongs to which country.

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:18.945
Another 30% will be about
our very own Indian repeat.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:22.394
Questions about its symbol
who issues it, the different

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.375
denominations and its features.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:30.435
Roughly 15% will test basic concepts like
foreign exchange and what it means when

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:32.954
a currency appreciates or depreciates.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.745
Don't worry, no complex calculations here.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:41.745
About 10% might touch upon the roles of
big international players like the IMF or

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.175
World Bank concerning global currencies.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.570
And the final 5% will be from
current affairs, like recent

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.380
currency value changes, or any major
economic drama affecting money.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:55.635
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:59.475
Now, for the tricks part,
forget mathematical formulas.

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:05.295
The real tricks here are memory aids and
solid concepts for country currency pairs.

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:09.644
Try grouping countries that use the
same currency like all the nations,

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.894
using the Euro for the tough ones.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:16.785
Create your own funny mnemonics and
please focus on major economies and

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.584
India's biggest trading partners first.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.195
For our Indian rupe, remember these facts.

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:23.725
The symbol is rupe.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:27.204
A cool mix of the rah with a line.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:32.155
The Reserve Bank of India or RBI
is the boss that issues bank notes.

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:35.695
But wait, the coins are issued
by the government of India.

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:41.545
Also know the current notes and coins
in circulation for exchange rate basics.

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:42.114
Just remember.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.150
Appreciation means the
currency got stronger so it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.830
can buy more foreign currency.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.520
Depreciation means it
got weaker and buys less.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:53.864
Methods of solving.

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:59.114
Solving these questions is mostly about
recall and clear concepts for those

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.975
country currency matching questions.

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:03.075
Use direct recall if you know it.

00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:05.565
If you're stuck, use elimination.

00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:08.024
Get rid of the options you know are wrong.

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:12.105
You can also try to associate a
country with its economic group,

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:13.609
which might hint at its currency.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
For questions on the Indian Rupe,
it's all about factual recall.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.659
Know the separate roles of the
RBI and the government of India

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.580
for exchange rate concepts.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.370
Make sure you properly
understand the definitions.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.680
Just think about the immediate impact.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.865
If our rupe appreciates what happens to
the price of things we import or export.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.910
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.080
Use flashcards for country currency
pairs and key facts about the rupe.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.600
Review them using spaced repetition,
categorize currencies by region like

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.820
all Asian or European currencies.

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:52.545
Use your visual memory.

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:56.655
Just looking at pictures of different
currency notes can help you remember them.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:05:00.075
And most importantly,
keep an eye on the news.

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:03.855
Current events related to
currencies often pop up in exams.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:08.595
Finally, practice with past M MCQs to
get used to how questions are framed.

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.985
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:12.284 --> 00:05:14.865
All right, let's talk
about the common traps.

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:16.905
Don't confuse similar names.

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:22.395
Many countries use a dollar or a dinar, so
always connected to the specific country.

00:05:22.784 --> 00:05:26.805
A classic mistake is thinking the
government of India issues everything.

00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:30.960
Remember RBI issues, bank notes
and the government issues coins.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.430
People also get tangled up with
appreciation and depreciation.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.900
A stronger rupe makes imports
cheaper, but it makes our exports

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.490
more expensive for foreigners.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.810
Also, stay up to date on the
latest series of bank notes and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.580
which ones have been demonetized.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.430
And don't just focus on
the G seven countries.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.870
Sometimes a question about the currency
of a smaller nation can surprise you.

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:57.465
WH framework summary.

00:05:57.765 --> 00:06:00.705
So to sum it all up, what is currency?

00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:03.825
It's a system of money
for exchange and value.

00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:08.085
Why do we have it to make trade
and economic transactions possible?

00:06:08.414 --> 00:06:11.234
When is it used every day for everything?

00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:13.455
For buying chai to international trade?

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:18.135
Where is it applied in every economy
and financial market on the globe?

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:19.335
Who uses it?

00:06:19.604 --> 00:06:20.265
Everyone.

00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:23.565
You, me, businesses,
governments, and central banks.

00:06:23.815 --> 00:06:27.925
And how is it applied through
physical cash, digital transfers,

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:30.055
and vast foreign exchange markets?

00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:32.605
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.315
Let's look at an example.

00:06:34.705 --> 00:06:35.335
Example.

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:36.625
One question.

00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:44.065
The official currency of Japan is
the A one B yen, C Yuan D bath.

00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.215
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:48.015 --> 00:06:50.115
This is a direct recall question.

00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:51.855
Let's break down the options.

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:55.125
The one is the currency
of South and North Korea.

00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:57.375
The Yuan is China's currency.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:06:59.325
The bath belongs to Thailand.

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:04.005
This leaves us with the yen, which is
indeed the official currency of Japan.

00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:06.435
Correct answer is B yen.

00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:09.125
Example two question.

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.945
Which of the following
statements about the Indian Rupe?

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:13.505
Rupe is correct?

00:07:13.895 --> 00:07:14.255
A?

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:18.575
It is issued by the Ministry of
Finance, government of India B. The

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:21.755
symbol Rupe was adopted in 2000 C.

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:24.875
All bank notes are issued by
the Reserve Bank of India.

00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:28.085
D coins are issued by the
Reserve Bank of India.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:30.995
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.050
Let's check these statements one by one.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.140
A is incorrect because RBI issues.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.880
Bank notes B is wrong.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.640
The symbol was adopted in 2010, not
2000 C states that all bank notes are

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.990
issued by the Reserve Bank of India,
which is absolutely correct, and D is

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.310
incorrect because coins are issued by
the government of India, not the RBI.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.150
Correct.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.320
Answer is C. All bank notes are
issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.990
Example three question.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.040
If the Indian Rupe appreciates
against the US dollar, what is the

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.110
likely impact on Indian imports?

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.690
A Imports become more expensive.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.790
B, imports become cheaper.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.220
C. Imports remain unchanged.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.350
D exports become cheaper.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.175
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:20.095 --> 00:08:21.835
Okay, let's analyze this.

00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:27.595
Appreciation means our rupe got stronger,
so one Rupe can buy more US dollars.

00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:34.044
Now, let's say yesterday $1 was 80
rupees, and today $1 is 75 rupees.

00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:35.845
Our rupe has appreciated.

00:08:36.145 --> 00:08:40.255
Now, imports are goods we buy from
other countries, often priced in

00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:44.245
dollars if we need fewer rupees
to buy the same amount of dollars.

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:48.535
It means those dollar priced goods
will cost us less in rupe terms.

00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:50.875
Therefore, imports become cheaper.

00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:51.594
Correct?

00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:54.204
Answer is B, imports become cheaper.

00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:55.224
Thank you.

00:08:55.314 --> 00:08:56.510
See you in the next lecture.
