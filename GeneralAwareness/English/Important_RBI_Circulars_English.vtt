00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.980
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on important RBI circulars.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.470
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.400
So what is this whole
drama about RBI Circulars?

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.670
Think of the Reserve
Bank of India, the RBI.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
As the head of the Indian Banking
family, it's the big boss responsible

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.000
for regulating every bank and deciding
the country's monetary policy.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:32.640
Now to keep everyone in line, the RBI
sends out instructions and guidelines.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
These official communications
are what we call RBI Circulars.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.140
They are basically official memos, or you
can say WhatsApp forwards from the family

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.050
head that everyone must read and follow.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
They serve as updates, new rules
or clarifications, ensuring all

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.500
financial players are on the same
page, operating safely and working

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.600
towards our national economic goals.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:02.525
These circulars can be about anything
from interest rates and lending rules

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:07.475
to digital payment, safety, and customer
service, all to maintain the stability

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:10.115
and integrity of our financial system.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:11.885
Real world relevance.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:16.775
Understanding these circulars is
absolutely critical because they

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.765
directly hit banking operations,
making sure banks are compliant and

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:22.685
implementing regulations properly.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.940
This knowledge helps in managing risks,
improving customer service, and making

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.095
smart strategic decisions within the bank.

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.495
Now these circulars come in many flavors.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:37.905
There are six important categories
you should know first, monetary

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.775
policy circulars, which are
directives on big rates like repo

00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:44.835
rate, reverse repo rate, CRR and SLR.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.645
Then we have prudential norms,
which are guidelines on asset

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:51.015
classification and capital adequacy.

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:55.405
Next, our customer service and
protection rules covering grievances

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:56.964
and digital banking safety.

00:01:57.414 --> 00:02:00.774
We also have foreign exchange
management for all things

00:02:00.774 --> 00:02:02.244
related to foreign currency.

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:07.914
Then there's financial inclusion, which
pushes banking services to unbanked areas.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:12.234
And finally, digital banking
and payments with guidelines on

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:15.775
U-P-I-N-E-F-T-R-T-G-S and cybersecurity.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:20.144
Breakdown of question types
based on patterns in your exam.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:24.435
Questions on these circulars usually
come in a few predictable formats.

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:29.505
About 40% are direct fact-based
questions, which ask about specific

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:33.704
numbers or dates from a circular, for
instance, what is the current limit

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.685
for contactless card transactions?

00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:39.195
Another 25% are purpose-based questions.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:43.815
Testing why a circular was issued,
like what's the main goal of the

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:45.945
RBI's, new digital lending norms.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.650
Then 20% are applicability
based questions.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.510
Focusing on who a circular applies
to, for example, which entities must

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.550
follow the revised PCA framework.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.120
A smaller 10% are
terminology based questions.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.530
Checking your knowledge of specific
terms such as what RBI guideline

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.690
is linked to expected credit loss.

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:12.345
And the 5% are on recent developments
asking about the very latest circulars,

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:16.245
like the one introducing small value
digital payments in offline mode.

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.135
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:20.174
So how do you master this?

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:24.434
First for dates, always note the
issue, date, and the effective date.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:28.095
For limits and rates, you have
to memorize key numbers, like

00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:30.285
transaction limits or capital ratios.

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:31.214
It's non-negotiable.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.550
Next, identify keywords or
unique phrases linked to specific

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.590
circulars like ombudsman scheme.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.580
Always understand the purpose, the
core reason behind the circular.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.460
And please get familiar with all the
acronyms like L-T-V-C-A-R, and KYC.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.230
A great memorization tip is to group
circulars by theme, like putting

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.890
all digital payment circulars
together to build mental connections.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.960
Flashcards are your best friend here.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.790
Methods of understanding.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.235
To truly understand the
circular, you need a system.

00:04:04.325 --> 00:04:09.185
First, identify the issuer and recipient
who sent it, and who is it for?

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.425
Is it for all commercial
banks or just N BFCs?

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.215
Second, read the subject line carefully.

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.915
It's the trailer of the movie,
giving you a quick summary.

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:23.455
Third, understand the background circulars
often refer to older ones, and knowing

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.555
the history helps you see the big picture.

00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:27.925
Fourth, pinpoint the core directive.

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:31.645
What is the RBI actually
asking banks to do or not To?

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:33.805
Fifth note, key definitions.

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:37.945
If a new term is introduced, pay
close attention to its exact meaning.

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:41.005
Sixth, look for effective
dates and deadlines.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.240
When do the rules kick in?

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.460
And finally, identify implications.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.560
How will this change banking or customer
services, shortcuts and smart techniques

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.229
for quick revision, focus on headlines.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.900
Get the main points without
drowning in details.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.580
Categorize circulars mentally by their
area like lending or customer service.

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.210
When a circular is amended,
do a comparative study and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.010
focus only on what changed.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.359
For number based questions, create a
quick numerical focus reference sheet.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:14.375
And my personal favorite,
always understand the why first,

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:16.025
before you memorize facts.

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:17.825
Know the reason behind the circular.

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:19.160
It makes everything stick.

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:21.929
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.450
Now, let's talk about the common traps.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.130
A big one is confusing dates, mixing up
the issue date with the effective date.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.450
Another is incorrect applicability,
assuming a rule for commercial

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.155
banks also applies to n BFCs.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.945
Relying on outdated information
is a classic blunder.

00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:43.835
RBI updates things frequently, so always
look for the latest master directions.

00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:47.495
Many friends also stumble by
misinterpreting terminology

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:50.224
and not knowing the precise
legal meaning of terms.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:54.065
And finally, ignoring amendments
is a recipe for disaster.

00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:57.515
Always check if a circular
has been updated or replaced.

00:05:57.975 --> 00:05:59.565
WH framework summary.

00:05:59.955 --> 00:06:04.305
So to wrap it all up with our simple
framework, what are RBI Circulars?

00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:08.325
They are official instructions
from the RBI to regulated entities.

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:12.195
Why are they issued to regulate
the financial system, ensure

00:06:12.195 --> 00:06:14.085
stability, and protect consumers.

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:14.985
When are they issued?

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.950
Periodically as needed in
response to economic changes.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.400
Where are they applicable across
the Indian financial sector?

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.480
Who is involved?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.950
The RBI issues them.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.650
Banks follow them and
they impact all of us.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.000
And how are they managed?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.140
They are published on the RBI website
and enforced through compliance.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:35.055
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:36.795
Let's try a few questions.

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:42.974
Example, one question as per a recent RBI
circular, what is the maximum amount for

00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:47.445
a single transaction using the offline
mode for small value digital payments?

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:54.585
A Rupees 200 B, rupees 500
C, rupees 1000 D rupees 2000.

00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:57.525
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.530
Solution.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.160
Step one, the question wants
the single transaction limit

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.690
for offline digital payments.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.910
This is a direct fact-based question.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.990
Step two, you need to recall the
specific RBI framework for this.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.920
It was introduced to help digital
payments in areas with poor internet.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.130
Step three, the circular
clearly specifies the limit.

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:21.235
The maximum amount for a single
offline transaction is Rupees 200.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:22.225
Step four.

00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:25.645
Checking the options, we see
that a is the correct answer.

00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:26.725
Correct Answer.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.315
A rupees 200.

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:30.325
Example two question.

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.075
Which of the following is the
primary objective of the RBI's?

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:35.365
Prompt corrective action.

00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:36.385
PCA framework for.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.980
A, to encourage banks to increase
lending to priority sectors.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.390
B, to provide a framework for banks to
manage their foreign exchange reserves.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.950
C, to enable the RBI to intervene
early in financially weak

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.360
banks to restore their health.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.440
D to regulate the interest rates
offered by banks on deposits.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.020
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.219
Solution.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.150
Step one.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.040
This is a purpose-based question.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.099
It asks for the primary
goal of the PCA framework.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.400
Step two, the PCA framework
is a supervisory tool.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.349
It gets activated when a bank's financial
health indicators like capital or asset

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:15.240
quality fall below a certain point.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:16.164
Step three.

00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:21.025
Its main goal is to allow the RBI to
step in early, impose restrictions

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:24.805
and force corrective measures to save
a weak bank before it's too late.

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:27.295
Step four, evaluating the options.

00:08:27.354 --> 00:08:30.745
C perfectly describes this
objective of early intervention

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:32.125
to restore a bank's health.

00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:36.985
The other options are incorrect,
correct answer C. To enable the RBI

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:40.645
to intervene early in financially
weak banks to restore their health.

00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:42.655
Example, three question.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.370
The leverage ratio for banks as
specified by RBI circulars is

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.810
primarily intended to A, manage
the bank's operational efficiency.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.980
B, act as a supplementary measure
to risk-based capital requirements.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.300
C, assess the bank's liquidity,
position D, determine the bank's

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.130
exposure to foreign currency risk.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.920
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:05.845
Solution.

00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:06.745
Step one.

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.775
This is a terminology based
question, asking for the

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:11.395
purpose of the leverage ratio.

00:09:11.545 --> 00:09:15.535
Step two, the leverage ratio is
calculated as tier one capital

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.875
divided by the bank's total exposures.

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:19.615
It's a non-risk based measure.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:24.355
Step three, it's regulatory role is
to act as a backstop or a safety net.

00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:28.735
While banks use risk-based capital
ratios, the leverage ratio ensures

00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:32.335
they don't take on excessive debt,
even if their risky assets look low.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.600
Step four.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.680
Comparing the options B correctly
states that it's a supplementary measure

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.480
to risk-based capital requirements.

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:43.830
The other options refer to different
metrics, correct answer B, act

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.890
as a supplementary measure to
risk-based capital requirements.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.819
Thank you.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.560
See you in the next lecture.
