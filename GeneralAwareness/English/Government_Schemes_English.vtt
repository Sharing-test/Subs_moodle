00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on government schemes.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.130
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.000
Explanation.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.900
So what are these government schemes
everyone keeps talking about?

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:20.915
Think of them as initiatives
or master plans launched by our

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:22.715
central or state governments.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:28.505
Their goal is to tackle specific social,
economic, or environmental issues.

00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:33.635
Basically, they exist to improve
our welfare, boost the economy,

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:38.015
provide essential services, and
hit various development targets.

00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:43.504
These schemes can offer anything from
financial help and subsidies to skill

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:45.379
development and new infrastructure.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.574
All designed to benefit
certain people or sectors.

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:53.144
Understanding them is not
just for passing an exam.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.644
It's crucial for any citizen to know
their rights and for professionals

00:00:57.644 --> 00:00:59.235
to guide people correctly.

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:01.575
Real world relevance.

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:04.035
Why should care first?

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:05.595
The economic impact?

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:10.905
These schemes drive financial inclusion
and push credit to important sectors,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:13.305
which affects the entire economy.

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:18.165
Second, as a professional in a public
facing role, you will definitely meet

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.025
beneficiaries of these schemes, so it's
your public service duty to be informed.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.270
Third for customer service.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.260
Understanding a scheme's objective
is absolutely essential for

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.700
helping people effectively.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.650
And finally, compliance.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.460
Knowing the details ensures you
guide beneficiaries properly

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.260
and stick to all the rules.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.920
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.090
Now for your exam, the question
setters have a favorite pattern.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
About 35% of questions will ask about
the scheme, objective or purpose.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.020
What is the main goal?

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.670
Around 25% of questions will be
about the launch date or year.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.110
When did it start?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.160
Then about 20% focus on
the target beneficiaries.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.425
Who is this scheme for?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.030
A smaller chunk, about 10% will test
you on key features or components,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
and the last 10% is split between
asking for the responsible ministry

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.020
or department and any associated
terminology, formulas and tricks.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.640
While there's no magic formula, we do have
some DEI jugar for remembering all this.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.640
First, use acronyms and mnemonics.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.340
Create catchy phrases for scheme names.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.100
Second, try categorization group
schemes by their ministry sector like

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.645
agriculture or health, or by their
objective like financial inclusion.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.240
Third timeline association link a
scheme's launch to a major national

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.950
event to build a mental map.

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:52.175
Fourth use keyword
association for each scheme.

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:56.825
Just remember two or three unique
keywords that trigger its purpose, and

00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:02.945
of course, the old Faithful Flashcards
scheme on one side, details on the other.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:04.655
Simple and effective.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:07.484
Methods of solving.

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:09.975
So how do we solve these questions?

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:11.745
Think like a detective.

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:14.625
First, identify the core purpose.

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:18.075
Always ask yourself, why
was this scheme launched?

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:19.995
What problem is it solving?

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.755
Second, pinpoint the target audience.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:23.925
Who is it for?

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.315
Is it for farmers, women,
or small businesses?

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:29.835
Third note the launch details.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:32.954
Memorize the year and
the ministry responsible.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.325
Fourth list its key features.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.425
What does the scheme actually do?

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:39.405
What are its main benefits?

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:42.015
Fifth, understand the implementation.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:43.394
How does it work?

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:46.635
Is it through direct benefit
transfer or subsidies?

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.545
And finally, connect to current events.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:54.075
Relating schemes to recent news
makes them much easier to remember.

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.204
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:59.965
Want the express lane
to mastering this topic.

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:02.065
Here are some smart techniques.

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.614
Focus on high impact schemes.

00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:10.165
Prioritize the big ones that are always
in the news or have massive budgets.

00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.105
Next, use comparative analysis.

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:17.454
When two schemes sound similar,
compare them side by side to

00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:19.045
see what makes them different.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.450
This avoids a lot of confusion.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.360
Remember, regular revision is key.

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.950
These schemes change.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.450
So spaced repetition is your
best friend, no cramming, always

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.310
have a what's new approach.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.500
Pay attention to any recent updates
or new phases of existing schemes

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.020
and in multiple choice questions.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.120
Use the elimination strategy.

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.840
Even if you aren't sure of the
right answer, you can often

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.300
eliminate the obviously wrong ones.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.050
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.289
All right, let's talk
about the common traps.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.690
A classic mistake is confusing.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.920
Scheme names, many acronyms
sound the same, so be careful.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.320
Another is getting incorrect.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.520
Launch dates wrong.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.590
The ear is usually enough, but know
the exact date for major schemes.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.870
People also misidentify beneficiaries.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.280
Assuming a scheme is for everyone,
when it's for a specific group.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.340
And please avoid mixing up ministries.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.840
Attributing a scheme to the wrong
department is a very common error.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.110
Also be aware of outdated information.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.210
Schemes get updated, so make
sure your sources are current.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.150
Lastly, don't just focus on the name.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.290
Overlooking key features means
you miss the crucial details.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.210
WH framework summary.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.500
To wrap it all up neatly,
let's use the WH framework.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.210
What are these schemes?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.770
They are government initiatives for
societal and economic challenges.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:57.594
Why do they exist to improve
welfare, promote growth, and

00:05:57.594 --> 00:05:59.185
achieve development goals?

00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:04.075
When are they launched at different
times, responding to specific needs?

00:06:04.344 --> 00:06:06.955
Where are they implemented across India?

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.115
Sometimes in targeted regions.

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:10.405
Who do they benefit?

00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:15.085
All citizens, but often specific
demographic groups or sectors.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:19.405
And how do they work through
financial aid, subsidies,

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:21.505
services, or new regulations.

00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.735
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:25.065 --> 00:06:26.835
Let's practice with an example.

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:27.795
Example.

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:29.325
One question.

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.740
The Phan Manna.

00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:37.185
P-M-J-D-Y was launched with the
primary objective of A providing

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:39.405
free housing to all rural families.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:45.045
B, promoting financial intrusion by
ensuring access to financial services.

00:06:45.285 --> 00:06:49.340
C, offering subsidized food grains
to below poverty line families.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.330
D, establishing new educational
institutions across the country understand

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.550
the question before moving to explanation.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.730
Step one is to analyze the question, which
asks for the main objective of P-M-J-D-Y.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.130
Step two, recall its purpose.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.120
P-M-J-D-Y is India's massive
financial inclusion program.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.170
Its whole point is to give
everyone access to a bank account.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.630
Step three, evaluate the options.

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:22.225
Housing is pr, food Grains is
the public distribution system.

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:26.365
Education has its own schemes,
so step four is clear.

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:30.115
Option B perfectly matches
the objective of P-M-J-D-Y.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.940
Example two question.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.810
Which of the following government
schemes is specifically aimed at

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.710
providing collateral free loans
to micro and small enterprises?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.110
A PR man, P-J-J-B-Y-B.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.100
AL Pension.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.310
Yona.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.110
A PYC.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.530
PR Man

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.705
understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:02.775
Step one, the question wants
the scheme for collateral free

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.245
loans for small businesses.

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:07.245
Step two, let's recall
what these schemes do.

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:09.795
P-M-J-J-B-Y is life insurance.

00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:11.685
A PY is a pension scheme.

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:16.575
PMMY gives loans up to 10, lacks to
micro enterprises, and a key feature

00:08:16.575 --> 00:08:21.105
is that they are collateral free
and P-M-S-P-Y is accident insurance.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.080
Step three.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.859
Evaluating these only mudra,
Yona fits the description.

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:29.429
So for step four, we select
the correct option, which is

00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:32.670
c. Example three question.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:39.390
The Ian Clean India mission was launched
with the primary goal of A, promoting

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.370
digital literacy in rural areas.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.830
B, achieving universal sanitation
coverage, and open defecation free status.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.840
C, providing financial assistance
to small farmers, D developing

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.580
smart cities across the country.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.640
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.780
Step one.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.600
We need the primary goal of SW Ian.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.790
Step two, recall the purpose.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.960
This was the huge nationwide
campaign to clean up India, and most

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.540
importantly, eliminate open defecation.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.910
Step three, let's look at the options.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.800
Digital literacy, farmer assistance, and
smart cities are all different missions.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.660
Option B about sanitation coverage
and making India open defecation free.

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.525
Core mission of SW Barat, step four.

00:09:24.704 --> 00:09:27.405
Therefore, option B is our correct answer.

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:28.364
Thank you.

00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:29.670
See you in the next lecture.
