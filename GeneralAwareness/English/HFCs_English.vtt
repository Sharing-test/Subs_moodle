00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.440
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on housing finance companies.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.130
Think of this as a cheat
code for understanding this

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.620
concept, concept explanation.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.160
So what on earth are these housing
finance companies or HFCs, think

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
of them as specialized financial
institutions here in India.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.890
Their one big mission, their primary
business is to provide long-term

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.125
finance for anything related to houses.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.690
We are talking, buying, building,
repairing, or even renovating a house.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.260
Now, they are a type of non-banking
financial company and NBFC, but they

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.060
are a distinct cousin because their
entire focus is just housing finance.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.670
They are not your regular bank, my friend.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.160
Unlike banks, HFCs cannot accept
demand deposits, you know, your

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
current or savings accounts where
you can pull money out anytime.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.150
However, they can accept public deposits,
but only for a fixed term, a minimum of

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.575
12 months and a maximum of 60 months.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.740
And here's a crucial
bit of trivia for you.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.880
Historically, these HFCs were regulated
by the National Housing Bank or NHB, but

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.970
since 2019, the big boss, the Reserve
Bank of India, the RBI, has taken

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.710
over their regulation to ensure better
financial stability and oversight.

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:29.235
Real world relevance.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.205
HFCs are incredibly important.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:36.735
They play a huge role in making
home ownership a reality for many

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:40.845
Indians by providing housing loans
that are actually accessible.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.475
They are a massive engine for
the growth of the real estate

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:49.335
sector, and they seriously promote
financial inclusion by giving loans

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:51.165
to different segments of society.

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:53.235
Let's break down their relevance.

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.085
First is home ownership.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:02:00.245
Of course, they help people like you
and me buy or build our dream homes.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:04.565
They also fuel real estate growth
by providing the needed capital

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:06.335
to developers and builders.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:09.755
This in turn, boosts the
entire housing sector.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.985
They are champions of financial
inclusion, extending credit to

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.135
those who might struggle to get
loans from traditional banks.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.880
Their lending acts as an economic stimulus
boosting growth through construction

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.220
and all the industries connected to it.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.200
They also support urban development
by financing new housing projects

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.420
in urban and semi-urban areas.

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:37.385
And finally, they offer an investment
avenue for individuals to invest

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.079
their savings through deposits.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.239
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.160
Now for your exam.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.070
What kind of questions can
pop up from this topic?

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.279
Typically, they fall
into a few categories.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.369
A big chunk, about 30 to 40% will test
you on the definition and core function.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.190
These are the straightforward,
what is an HFC, or what is its

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.170
main job type of questions.

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:09.380
Another major area around 25 to 35%
will be about the regulatory body.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.350
Questions will focus
on who regulates them.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.959
That is the RBI now and
historically the NHB and any policy

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.505
changes related to this shift.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.850
Then you have questions on the
distinction from banks or other n

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.180
BFCs, which make up about 15 to 20%.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.520
These highlight the key differences.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.070
A smaller part may be 10 to 15%
will be on key terms and concepts

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.230
like housing loan or mod gauge.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.650
And finally, a tiny but tricky five to
10% might cover recent developments or

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.500
policy changes from RBI or the government.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.230
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.890
Looking for some secret
formulas or mathematical tricks.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.930
I have to disappoint you, my friend.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.670
For general awareness topics
like HFCs, there are no formulas.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.350
The focus is purely on factual knowledge
and understanding the concepts.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.060
So the key focus area should be
a solid conceptual understanding

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.740
of HFCs and their role.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.720
You must have a factual recall of the
regulatory bodies and the timelines.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.500
You should be able to list the
distinguishing features from other

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.480
financial institutions, and of course,
keep an eye on current developments

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.130
in the housing finance sector.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:31.965
Methods of solving since this is
a general awareness topic, solving

00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:33.765
a problem isn't about maths.

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:36.765
The method here involves a few key things.

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:38.985
First is conceptual understanding.

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:44.145
You must grasp the core definition,
purpose, and how HFCs operate.

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.285
Next is factual recall.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:50.815
Memorizing key facts like the
regulator, the history and specific

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.585
features is non-negotiable.

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:58.075
Then comes comparative analysis, which
is your ability to clearly differentiate

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:00.445
HFCs from other financial bodies.

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:03.505
Finally, there's current
affairs integration.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:08.410
You must stay updated with recent
news and policy changes about HFCs.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.849
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.430
All right, let's get to
the smart techniques.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.280
Use keyword association immediately
connect HFC with housing finance, and

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.849
very importantly, RBI regulation since
2019, always know your acronym expansion.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.409
HFC is housing finance company.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.900
Don't get caught out.

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:34.325
Use the elimination strategy
in multiple choice questions.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.160
If you know just a few facts, you
can often kick out the wrong options.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.690
For instance, if a question asks
about the regulator and sebi is an

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.520
option, you know it's wrong because
sebi handles the securities market.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.170
Focus on change.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.280
Pay special attention to recent
shifts, like the big move from

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.780
NHB to RBI regulation as these
are hot topics for questions.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.080
Lastly, try mind mapping a simple visual
map connecting HFCs to their functions.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.130
Regulators and differences from
banks can do wonders for memory,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.919
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.690
Let's talk about the common
traps First is confusing.

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.010
HFCs with banks.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.900
A classic mistake is
thinking HFCs are banks.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.200
Remember, they cannot
accept demand deposits.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.650
Another big one is naming
the incorrect regulator.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.490
Many people still think
NHB is the sole regulator.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.440
It is crucial to remember.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.720
RBI is the primary regulator.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.100
Since 2019 though, NHB still
plays a developmental role.

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:47.005
Some belief in a limited scope thinking
HFCs only give loans for new homes.

00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:47.815
False.

00:06:48.205 --> 00:06:52.675
They also finance construction,
renovation, and even plot purchases.

00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:55.465
There's also a deposit misunderstanding.

00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:58.885
People think HFCs can't take any deposits.

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:03.625
Wrong again, they can accept term
deposits, just not demand deposits.

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:07.615
And finally, people are
ignoring their NBFC status.

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:11.775
Don't forget, HFCs are a
specific, specialized type of

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:13.605
non-banking financial company.

00:07:14.924 --> 00:07:16.484
WH framework summary.

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:22.455
So to summarize it all quickly, what are
they Financial institutions mainly for?

00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:23.325
Housing loans.

00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:27.075
Why do they exist to promote
home ownership and support

00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:28.275
the real estate sector?

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:29.775
When are they needed?

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:32.775
When people or companies
need money for housing?

00:07:33.155 --> 00:07:36.335
Where do they operate within
the Indian financial sector?

00:07:36.695 --> 00:07:37.985
Who benefits from them?

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:40.955
Individuals, cooperatives, and developers.

00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:42.425
And how do they work?

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.784
By offering housing loans
and accepting term deposits?

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:46.295
Simple.

00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:46.325
Uh.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.360
Fully worked out.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.110
Examples.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.060
Let's tackle an example.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.020
Example.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.460
One question.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.760
Which of the following is the
primary function of housing

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.280
finance companies, HFCs in India?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.220
A, providing short-term personal loans.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.370
B. Accepting demand
deposits from the public.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.970
C. Providing long-term
finance for housing purposes.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.390
D. Managing mutual funds
and stock investments.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.325
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:16.965
All right.

00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:20.985
The question asks for the primary,
the main function of an HFC.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:22.995
Let's recall the definition.

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:26.085
HFCs are all about financing houses.

00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:28.875
Now let's check the options option.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:33.495
A short-term personal loans is
the job of other m BFCs or banks.

00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:37.964
Option B, accepting demand
deposits is something HFCs are

00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.734
explicitly not allowed to do.

00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:44.415
Option D managing mutual funds is
for asset management companies.

00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:49.035
That leaves us with option C providing
long-term finance for housing.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.484
This perfectly matches
the core business of HFCs.

00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:57.045
Correct answer c. Example two question.

00:08:57.405 --> 00:09:02.325
As of 2019, which regulatory body
primarily oversees housing finance

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:05.055
companies, HFCs in India, a.

00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:09.435
Securities and Exchange Board of
India, sebi B, national Housing

00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:15.285
Bank, NHBC, reserve Bank of India,
RBID, insurance Regulatory and

00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:17.475
Development Authority of India IRDA.

00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:20.865
I understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:26.865
The key phrase here is, as of 2019,
this is a big hint about a change.

00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:32.655
We know that historically, NHB was
the regulator, but in 2019, the

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.435
regulatory powers were transferred
to the RBI for stronger oversight.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.400
Let's look at the options.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.440
SEBI regulates securities.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.870
I-R-D-A-I regulates insurance.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.330
So A and D are out now.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.880
It's between NHB and RBI because the
question specifies the 2019 timeline.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.070
The correct regulator is the new one.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.910
While NHB still has a role,
primary oversight, went to

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.550
the RBI, correct answer c.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.280
Example three question.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.870
Which of the following statements is true
regarding housing financing companies?

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.680
HFCs?

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.600
In India, a HFCs are allowed to accept
demand deposits from the public.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.910
B HFCs are primarily engaged in
providing short-term agricultural loans.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.020
C HFCs are a type of
non-banking financial company.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.340
D HFCs are regulated by the
Ministry of Finance directly.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.430
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.490
We need to find the one true statement.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.140
Let's go one by one.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.350
Statement A says they can
accept demand deposits.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.370
This is false.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.500
They can only take term deposits.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.310
Statement B says they provide
short-term agricultural loans.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.660
This is also false.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.210
Their focus is long-term housing finance.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.560
Statement D says, they are regulated
directly by the Ministry of Finance.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.940
This is also false.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.985
The direct regulator is the RBI.

00:10:56.605 --> 00:11:01.165
That leaves us with statement
C that HFCs are a type of NBFC,

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.205
and that is absolutely true.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:06.715
They are a specialized category
under the NBFC umbrella.
