00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Prime Minister Schemes.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept explanation.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.270
All right, let's get into it.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
Prime Minister schemes are basically
the government of India's blockbuster

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.380
initiatives, often carrying the PM's.

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:26.365
Think of them as grand plans to tackle
our country's socioeconomic challenges.

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:31.705
They aim to promote welfare and
supercharge development across every

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:33.565
possible sector you can imagine.

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:39.385
From financial inclusion and education
to health, agriculture, employment,

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:42.025
infrastructure, and social security.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.724
It's a full course meal of development.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.940
These schemes zoom in on specific
groups, regions, or sometimes the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.380
whole population, all with the
goal of improving living standards,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.820
boosting economic growth, and making
sure there's social justice for all.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.320
Each scheme comes with a clear rule book.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:07.055
Defined objectives, target beneficiaries,
and implementing ministry and a budget.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:11.735
Sometimes they are just a fancy
rebrand or a supersized version

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.405
of an older program for your exam.

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:18.425
Understanding these schemes
is absolutely non-negotiable.

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:23.485
As they show what the government is
focusing on and how it impacts citizens.

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:29.425
For instance, the P-M-J-D-Y is all about
getting everyone a bank account while

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:32.695
the SW Abian is about clean surroundings.

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.755
And remember, these
schemes are not static.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:41.155
They evolve with bigger budgets or new
eligibility rules popping up over time.

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:42.865
Real world relevance.

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:44.855
Now, why should care?

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:49.295
Well, understanding these Prime
Minister schemes is super crucial

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:53.615
because banks are the soldiers on the
ground implementing these policies.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:58.685
This is especially true for financial
inclusion initiatives and handling

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.545
direct benefit transfers or DBT.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.400
Knowing these schemes inside out helps
specialist officers like you guide

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.630
customers through the maze of government
backed financial products, which in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.820
turn helps in community development.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.490
Let's look at a few relevant schemes.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.365
First, the Phan, Rihanna.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.540
Or P-M-J-D-Y from 2014.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.840
Its mission is to make financial inclusion
a reality by giving everyone access to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.690
banking, savings, remittances, credit
insurance, and pension, all affordably,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.790
often with zero balance accounts.

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:41.515
Then there's the Phan RI
Mudra or PM MY from 2015.

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:46.645
This one offers loans up to a cool
10 LAC rupees to the little guys,

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:51.505
the non-corporate, non-farm, small
and micro enterprises under its

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.535
famous Shiho, ki, and Tar Categories.

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:59.805
We also have the Atal Pension
Yona, or a PY from 2015.

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:05.085
This one, a social security scheme
that promises a monthly pension between

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:08.835
1000 to 5,000 rupees after U-Turn 60.

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:12.645
It's mainly for our hardworking
friends in the unorganized

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:15.315
sector, aged between 18 and 40.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.109
Next up are the twin insurance schemes.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.540
The Phan AK, or P-M-S-B-Y from 2015 is
a rock solid accident insurance scheme.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.160
It offers two lack rupees for
accidental death and one lack rupees

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.930
for partial disability, all for a tiny
premium of just 12 rupees per year.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.570
Its cousin, the Phan Jivan or P-J-J-B-Y
from 2015 is a life insurance scheme.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.040
It provides a two LAC rupe cover
for death due to any reason for a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.260
yearly premium of 330 rupees for
those between 18 and 50 years.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.720
Finally, we have the Standup
India scheme from 2016.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.790
This one is about empowerment,
facilitating loans from 10 LA all the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.280
way up to one crawl rupees to at least
one SC or st. Or one woman borrower

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.990
per bank branch, helping them set up
brand new non-agricultural businesses.

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:18.635
Breakdown of question types, so
what kind of questions can you

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:22.805
expect in the exam based on past
patterns for general awareness?

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:26.315
The questions about Prime Minister
schemes are quite predictable.

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:30.215
A hefty 40% are direct
fact-based questions.

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:34.925
These will ask for the launch year or
date, the full form of an acronym, the

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.460
ministry in charge, the main objective
or the target beneficiaries of a scheme.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:41.855
Simple, direct, and factual.

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:46.055
Another 30% are feature or
benefit based questions.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:51.515
These dig a little deeper into specific
features like loan limits, insurance

00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:53.675
coverage amounts, or age criteria.

00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.715
You need to know the nitty gritty here.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:59.375
Then about 20% are
statement based questions.

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:03.685
They'll give you multiple statements
about one scheme and ask you to

00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:05.815
spot the correct or incorrect one.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:10.435
These are designed to test your
deeper understanding, and finally, a

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:14.995
small but tricky 10% are application
or scenario based questions.

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:19.044
You'll get a short story or scenario
and have to figure out which

00:05:19.044 --> 00:05:20.455
scheme fits the situation best.

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:22.815
Formulas and tricks.

00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:26.865
Now, there are no maths formulas
here, but I have some secret

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:30.555
formulas for you to memorize and
recall this information effectively.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.715
First, acronym expansion.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:36.525
Always, always learn the full
form of the scheme's Acronym

00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:39.914
like P-M-J-D-Y is PRRI Janna.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:45.405
Second keyword association link every
scheme to one or two core keywords.

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:49.005
For example, B-M-J-D-Y
means financial inclusion.

00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:53.125
PMMY means microloan
and a PY means pension.

00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:55.075
Third is ministry mapping.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:58.854
Create a mental map associating
schemes with their ministries.

00:05:58.974 --> 00:06:02.125
Like P-M-J-D-Y falls under
the Ministry of Finance.

00:06:02.455 --> 00:06:06.565
Fourth year grouping, bunch together,
schemes launched in the same year.

00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:11.844
For example,
P-M-J-D-Y-P-M-M-Y-P-M-S-B-Y-P-M-J-J-B-Y,

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:12.715
and a PY.

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:15.445
Were all children of 2014 15.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.740
Fifth target group focus.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.390
Always identify the main beneficiary,
whether it's farmers, women,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.490
youth, or the unorganized sector.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.650
And finally, financial figures.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.900
You must memorize key numbers like wra,
loan limits or insurance coverage amounts.

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:33.655
Methods of solving.

00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:37.015
When you see a question on
these schemes, don't panic.

00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:39.805
Solving here means a systematic takedown.

00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:41.995
First, deconstruct the question.

00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:44.695
Identify what it's really asking about.

00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:49.645
Note the keywords like launched
in 2015 or for small enterprises.

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:54.805
Next, recall key information based on
the scheme mentioned, pull out its full

00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:58.735
form launch year, objective beneficiaries
and ministry from your memory.

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:03.234
If it's a feature-based question,
recall those specific details.

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:05.604
Then evaluate each option.

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:09.205
Go through choices A,
B, C, and D one by one.

00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:12.474
Compare each option with what
you know about the scheme.

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:15.025
Eliminate the ones that
are obviously wrong.

00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:17.695
After that, identify the best fit.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.580
For direct questions, it's a
perfect match for statement ones.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.000
Check each statement's accuracy
for objective questions.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.720
Pick the option that describes the
scheme's purpose most accurately,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.710
and if you have a moment to spare,
do a quick cross verification.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.750
Reread the question and your chosen answer
to make sure they are a logical pair.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.120
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.970
Want some smart techniques
for the exam hall?

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.870
Here you go.

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:46.205
Use the elimination strategy.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:50.615
If you're not sure, get rid of the
options that are clearly nonsense.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:53.375
This dramatically improves
your guessing odds.

00:07:53.825 --> 00:07:55.565
Look for contextual clues.

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:58.685
The name of the scheme
itself is often a big hint.

00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:04.065
Jivan Joti suggests life, and
akha implies safety or insurance.

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:08.145
Use a common sense Check for
questions about objectives.

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:12.705
Ask yourself if the stated goal makes
sense for a government welfare scheme.

00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:14.535
Focus on uniqueness.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:17.805
Many schemes have broad
goals like poverty reduction.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:22.485
Zero in on what makes each one
different, like its specific target

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.795
group or a unique financial mechanism.

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.375
Also, practice categorization.

00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:31.415
Mentally group schemes by
sector like financial inclusion,

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:33.005
health, or agriculture.

00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:36.995
This helps you narrow down
options fast and for launch

00:08:36.995 --> 00:08:39.155
dates, try the odd one out trick.

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:42.905
If you know a scheme was launched
around a certain time, you can

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:47.585
eliminate years that are way off
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.630
Let's talk about the common
traps you must avoid.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.670
A big one is confusing.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.390
Similar schemes.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.410
Many schemes have similar names or goals.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.520
The correction is to focus on the
unique features that distinguish them.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.810
Another classic mistake is getting
incorrect launch dates or years

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.650
mixed up to fix this, create
a timeline or group schemes.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.880
By year, people also make a mess
of wrong ministry association.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.810
The solution is to pay close attention
to the implementing ministry.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.275
When you study.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.900
A very common error is
misunderstanding objectives, not

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.880
getting the precise aim of a scheme.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.100
To avoid this, clearly define the
what and why for each one, and please

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.410
don't ignore eligibility criteria.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.670
Overlooking age limits or income
conditions can cost you Marks

00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:37.949
always note down these requirements.

00:09:38.275 --> 00:09:40.735
Finally avoid generalizing features.

00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:43.825
Don't assume all schemes
offer similar benefits.

00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:47.575
Memorize the specific financial
limits and coverage amounts.

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.855
WH framework summary.

00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:54.625
So to wrap it all up with a simple
framework, what are these schemes?

00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:58.050
They are government initiatives
to tackle socioeconomic issues.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.689
Why do they exist to improve
living standards, boost economic

00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:04.819
growth, and ensure social justice?

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.329
When are they launched periodically
by the central government,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.770
based on national needs?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.790
Where are they implemented
nationwide across all regions

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.170
and sections of society.

00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:20.865
Who benefits everyone from individuals
and families to farmers, entrepreneurs

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.055
and workers in the unorganized sector.

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:26.865
And how are they applied through
mechanisms like direct benefit

00:10:26.865 --> 00:10:30.855
transfers, subsidies, loans,
skill programs and infrastructure

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:33.585
projects, fully worked out examples.

00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:36.435
All right, let's put this
knowledge to the test.

00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:37.695
Example one.

00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:42.235
Question, which of the following
Prime Minister schemes aims to provide

00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:46.885
universal access to banking facilities,
including savings, deposit accounts,

00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:51.175
remittances, credit insurance, and
pension in an affordable manner?

00:10:51.565 --> 00:10:53.575
A Phan RI mudra.

00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:56.665
Yona, P-M-M-Y-B, utter pension.

00:10:56.665 --> 00:10:56.755
Yo.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:11:01.580
A-P-Y-D-Y.

00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:09.125
Dms y understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:09.515 --> 00:11:10.625
Let's break it down.

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:11.615
The question's.

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:16.895
Key phrase is universal access to banking
facilities or financial inclusion option.

00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:21.065
A-P-M-M-Y is about microloan,
not universal banking.

00:11:21.155 --> 00:11:22.025
So A is out.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.040
Option BAPY is a pension
scheme specific, not universal.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.630
So B is also out.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.380
Option D-B-M-S-B-Y is
for accident insurance.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.290
Again, a specific product, so D is gone.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.930
Option C-P-M-J-D-Y has the core mission
of financial inclusion, providing

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.715
access to all the services mentioned.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.520
It's a perfect match answer
option C. Example two question.

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:53.230
The utter pension, Yona A PY primarily
targets which of the following

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.740
groups to provide a guaranteed
pension after 60 years of age.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.260
A, organized sector employees, B,
government, employees, C workers

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.949
in the unorganized sector, D,
large corporate businesses.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.760
Understand the question before.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.410
Moving to explanation here, the question
asks for the primary target group of

00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:18.230
a PY, let's recall, a PY is a social
security scheme, and its main focus

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.340
is to encourage voluntary savings for
retirement, especially among those who

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.170
don't have a formal pension structure.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.220
Option a. Organized sector
employees usually have EP,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.260
F, so not the primary target.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.760
Option B, government employees have
their own pension schemes, definitely

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.715
incorrect Option D. Large businesses
are not individuals, so that's absurd.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.750
This leaves option C workers in the
unorganized sector, which aligns

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.330
perfectly with the core objective of a PY.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.700
It's designed for them answer
option C. Example three question.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Which of the following schemes
is an accident insurance scheme?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.740
Offering a one year cover, renewable
from year to year, providing coverage for

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.750
death or disability due to accident for
people in the age group, 18 to 70 years.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.410
A

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.625
prm, J-J-B-Y-B, Al Pension, a PY.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:21.775
CSD Standup India scheme understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:23.245
Let's dissect this.

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:27.865
The key descriptors are accident insurance
scheme, one year, renewable cover,

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:32.425
death or disability due to accident,
and the age group, 18 to 70 years.

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:34.735
Let's check the options option.

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:39.325
A-P-M-J-J-B-Y is life insurance
for death from any cause and

00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:41.035
for the 18 to 50 years group.

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:42.535
So A is incorrect.

00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:47.575
Option BAPY is a pension scheme,
not insurance, so B is wrong.

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:51.115
Option D, standup India is a
loan scheme, not insurance.

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:52.395
So D is out.

00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:53.775
Option C, PR

00:13:55.785 --> 00:14:01.005
or P-M-S-B-Y is explicitly an accident
insurance scheme for accidental death

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:05.895
and disability for the 18 to 70 years
age and is renewable annually, it

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:09.104
takes every single box answer option C.

00:14:09.525 --> 00:14:10.094
Thank you.

00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:11.655
See you in the next lecture.
