00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on important Days.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.980
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.820
Explanation.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.360
So what on earth are these important days?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.870
We keep hearing about.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.600
Think of them as special dates
on the calendar, my friend.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.430
They are officially marked to remember
a significant event from the past

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.680
to raise a big halabaloo about a
current issue or to give a pat on the

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.689
back for some notable achievement.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.480
These days can be important for
historical, cultural, social, or even

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.590
environmental reasons, and people
observe them all over the world.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
Or sometimes just within our own country.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.330
Understanding these helps you get a better
grip on current affairs, a bit of history,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.180
and why certain movements and initiatives
are a big deal, real world relevance.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.100
Now, why should you care?

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:02.845
Knowing these important days
helps professionals like you

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:06.835
stay updated on what's happening
nationally and internationally.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:11.485
This is super crucial for understanding
the economic and social waves

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:13.285
that affect the financial world.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.995
Plus, it makes you sound incredibly
smart in general conversations

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:22.315
and helps in public relations,
boosting your overall awareness.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:24.025
It's a win-win, isn't it?

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.095
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.179
Based on patterns from your
exam, questions on this topic

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.100
are not as random as you think.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.399
They mostly fall into
a few neat categories.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.850
First, making up about half
of the questions is the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.800
direct date to event matching.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.919
They give you a date and
you tell them the event.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.850
For example, when is World
Environment Day celebrated?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.759
Next up making about 30% of the questions
is the reverse event to date matching.

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:58.495
They give you the event and ask for
the date, like World Environment

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.445
Day is celebrated on which date.

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:04.345
Then we have the increasingly
popular theme-based questions,

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:06.384
which are about 15% of the pie.

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:10.644
These will ask for the specific
theme for a day in a particular

00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:15.655
year, such as what was the theme
for International Yoga Day 2024.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:20.454
Finally, the remaining 5% asked
significance of purpose questions.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.769
Which might ask why we even bother
celebrating a particular day.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.450
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.260
All right.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.160
There are no magical math
formulas here, but there are some

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.959
fantastic tricks for your brain.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.030
First is association.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.489
Try to link a day to a personal memory,
maybe a friend's birthday or a major

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.530
event that happened around that time.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.060
It just takes data.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.310
Second is categorization.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.750
Don't learn them randomly.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
Group the days by month or by
theme, like all environmental days

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.160
together or all health days together.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.420
You can also group them by UN
days versus Indian National Days.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.489
Next, use mnemonics.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.709
Create little memorable phrases.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.359
For example, to remember January
12th for National Youth Day and

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.000
January 25th for National Voters Day.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.234
You could think youth vote on 1225.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.200
Silly, but it works.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.350
Then there's good old
repetition and revision.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.750
Go over your list regularly, maybe for
a few minutes every day, and finally

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.450
use flashcards, physical or digital.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.330
They are brilliant for
testing your memory on the go.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.110
Methods of solving.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.800
Here's how to tackle these
questions step by step.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.090
For direct questions, obviously,
try direct recall from your memory.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.940
First, if your memory is
playing hide and seek.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.780
Use the elimination method, look
at the options, and kick out

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.370
the ones that are clearly wrong.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.475
This seriously improves your chances.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.440
For theme-based questions,
use contextual clues.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.090
A theme about saving water is probably
not for world laughter day, right?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.590
It's likely for World Water Day, if
you remember the month, but not the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.130
exact date Use month association
to narrow down your choices.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:12.274
And for theme questions, you can also try
reverse engineering if a theme is given.

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:15.244
Think about which day's
purpose matches that theme.

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:18.995
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to be even smarter.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.735
Try a monthly focus, dedicate a
day to master all the important

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:27.995
days of just one month, say
January, and then move to the next.

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:30.760
Don't try to swallow the
whole calendar in one go.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.290
You can also create a calendar
mark these days on your own

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.970
physical or digital calendar.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.550
The visual reminder is very powerful.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.080
Try storytelling.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.390
Weave a small, funny story that connects
a few days chronologically, or by theme.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.660
It's easier to remember a
story than a boring list.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.690
Also, focus on high frequency days.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.600
Prioritize the VIP days that are
asked again and again in exams like

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.340
World Environmental Day, international
Yoga Day, and our own Republic Day.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.200
Lastly, a little daily review of
five to 10 minutes can work wonders

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.570
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.270
Now let's talk about the common traps.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.610
Many people confuse similar dates.

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:18.325
For example, some days fall
very close to each other, so

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:19.885
double check the exact date.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:24.475
Another classic mistake is mixing
up National and International Days.

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:27.415
Labor Day, for example,
has different dates.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.385
Gee, crystal clear about
which one is being asked.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.099
A huge mistake is ignoring themes.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.320
Friends often just cram dates and events,
but examiners are getting clever and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.539
asking for annual themes more and more.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.780
Also, make sure you have
the latest information.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.580
Themes change every year, so
don't study outdated material, and

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.260
please avoid over memorization.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.640
Trying to learn every single
day is a recipe for disaster.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.549
Focus on the most significant ones first.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.469
WH framework Summary.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:03.455
So to put it all in a nutshell,
what are we talking about?

00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:07.655
Specific dates marked for observing
events or raising awareness.

00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:13.415
Why do we do it to commemorate history,
promote causes and foster unity.

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.865
When are they observed
annually on fixed dates.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:22.505
Where either globally like uns or
nationally within a country who

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:28.055
governments big organizations like
the UN and WHO, NGOs, and of course

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:32.975
people like us, and how is it done
through events, campaigns, educational

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:37.715
programs, and all sorts of public
initiatives, fully worked out Examples.

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.755
Example, one Question.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.340
World Environment Day is
celebrated annually on which date?

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:49.545
A June 1st, B June 5th, C
July 11th, D August 12th.

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:51.345
Understand the question before.

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:52.605
Moving to explanation.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:56.235
The question is a straightforward
one, asking for the date

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:57.585
of World Environment Day.

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:01.575
World Environment Day is a major
global event for environmental

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:02.835
awareness and action.

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.650
It is celebrated every year on June 5th.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.700
Looking at the options, option
B matches our answer perfectly.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.550
Answer Option B, example two.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.330
Question.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.479
International yoga day is
observed on which date?

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.130
A June 15th.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.585
B June 21st, C July 1st, D July 15th.

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:25.575
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.200
This one asks for the date
of International Yoga Day.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.060
You need to recall the date that promotes
the wonderful benefits of yoga worldwide.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.810
International Yoga Day is
celebrated on June 21st.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.460
Fun fact, this date was chosen because
it's the summer solstice in the Northern

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.500
Hemisphere, the longest day of the year.

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:49.895
So matching this with the options B is
the correct choice, answer option B.

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:54.905
Example three question on which date
is National Voters Day celebrated

00:07:54.905 --> 00:08:01.865
in India, A January 12th, B January
25th, C, February 28th, D March 8th.

00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:04.895
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:08.135
The question specifically
asks For a National Day in

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:09.530
India, national Voters Day.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.940
The day was established to encourage young
voters to participate in our democracy.

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:17.430
You need to recall this specific date.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.710
National Voters Day is celebrated on
January 25th each year because this

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.760
was the day the Election Commission
of India was founded back in 1950.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.260
Comparing this with the options
provided, option B is the correct answer.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.539
Answer option B. Thank you.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.280
See you in the next lecture.
