Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on business and economic updates.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.910
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.990
Explanation.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.450
So what's all this hung about?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.960
Business and economic updates
re, it's nothing to fear.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.650
Think of it as the latest
gossip from the world of money.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.169
It refers to all the latest
developments, the hot new trends,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.549
and the big changes happening in
business and the economy, both in

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:33.800
our backyard and all over the world.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.410
For your exam, this basically means you
need to understand key economic numbers,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.420
what the government is up to with its
policies, what our boss of banks, the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.150
RBI is doing with its monetary policy.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.840
Major industry news and where India
stands in the global financial playground.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.270
Staying up to date helps you grasp this
ever changing financial scene and how

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.430
it affects how banks actually work.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.380
Real world relevance.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.070
And believe me, this isn't
just theory for exams.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.530
It's the real world.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
When the RBI changes, its monetary
policy, like fiddling with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.960
interest rates, it directly hits
bank lending and deposit rates.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.220
This affects how much profit
a bank makes and how we the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.290
customers behave with our money.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.720
Then there are inflation trends.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
If you understand inflation, you can
figure out the real value of money, which

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
is super important for pricing loans
and making smart investment choices.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.570
What about GDP growth?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.220
A strong GDP number means our
economy is healthy, like it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.020
just had a good breakfast.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.300
This leads to more people and businesses
wanting loans and fewer people failing

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.160
to pay them back, which is music to
a banksia and government schemes.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.480
New initiatives, often use banks
to get things done, creating

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.940
fantastic new business opportunities.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.310
Don't forget international trade.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.930
Global trade drama affects foreign
exchange rates and money transfers

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.850
across borders, which is bread and butter
for banks in international finance.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.150
Lastly, banking sector reforms like
new rules or big bank mergers directly

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.440
change the game, redrawing the
competitive map and the rule book for

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.470
every bank breakdown of question types.

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:26.355
All right.

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:30.434
Let's talk strategy based on
past patterns for the general

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.084
awareness and economy sections.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.535
In your exam, you'll see a
few common types of questions.

00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:41.054
About 40 to 50% will be current
affairs, a very fact-based format.

00:02:41.565 --> 00:02:46.304
These are direct questions about recent
policy changes, new government schemes,

00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:51.435
important appointments, reports, and
specific numbers like the latest repo

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.760
rate, or a new GDP growth forecast.

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:59.084
Then making up 30 to 35% of
the questions is conceptual.

00:02:59.084 --> 00:03:03.495
Understanding these tests, if you
actually understand the terms, not

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:08.595
just memorize them, they'll ask things
like, what is inflation or what is

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:14.174
the impact of SLR On liquidity, A
smaller chunk, about 10 to 15% will

00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:16.334
be on abbreviations and terminologies.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.590
These are straightforward questions asking
for the full form of something like sebi

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.049
or the definition of a specific term.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.829
Finally, a small but important five to
10% will be on reports and indices asking

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.750
about India's rank in global reports or
key findings from big bodies like the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.320
IMF or World Bank formulas and tricks.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.799
Now, thankfully, this topic is
less about complex mathematical

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.989
formulas and more about smart memory
tricks or what we can call jugar.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.299
First, for monetary policy rates, you
must must remember the latest reper

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.630
rate, reverse reper rate, CRR and SLR.

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:02.279
The RBI updates these frequently,
so always have the latest numbers.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:07.445
For key economic indicators, don't
stress about memorizing every decimal.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.925
Instead, focus on the
direction and general trend.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.415
Is GDP growth going up or down?

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:16.055
What about inflation or unemployment?

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:20.135
For government scheme, acronyms,
memorize the full forms and

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.665
what they are trying to achieve.

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:22.595
For example.

00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:28.785
P-M-J-D-Y or PMMY for international
bodies create a simple mental link

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:31.005
between a report and who publishes it.

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:35.595
Like World Economic Outlook comes
from the IMF and ease of doing

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:37.305
business from the World Bank.

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:42.045
And of course, the who is who keep
a running list of key appointments

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:46.150
like the RBI governor or the
SEBI chairman methods of solving.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.250
So when you see a question,
how do you solve it?

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.330
It's all about recalling and
applying your knowledge effectively.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.820
Let's try the categorization method.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.100
Step one, when you read a piece of news,
immediately put it in a box in your head.

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:06.885
Is it monetary policy, a government
scheme, or international trade?

00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:11.174
Step two, within that category,
find the core subject.

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:16.365
For instance, in monetary policy, is it
about interest rates or something else?

00:05:16.724 --> 00:05:21.674
Step three, note down the key facts,
the specific rate, the name of the

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:23.835
scheme or the countries involved.

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.164
Another approach is the
impact analysis method.

00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:31.424
Step one for any update,
identify the main event.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.050
Step two, think about its
direct impact on banks.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.140
How does a repo rate
cut affect bank lending?

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.450
Step three, think bigger.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.590
What are the wider economic
implications like how a new trade

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.450
deal affects India's exports?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.180
Finally, there's the comparative method.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.690
When a new report comes
out, compare India's current

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.095
ranking with its previous one.

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:59.215
Then try to figure out the reasons
for any big change, good or bad,

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:04.015
and if it's relevant, compare our
performance to other big economies,

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:06.355
shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:08.485
Everyone loves a shortcut, right?

00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:10.525
Here are some smart techniques.

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.595
First, the daily news scan.

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:17.215
Just dedicate 15, 20 minutes every
day to quickly scan headlines

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:18.775
from good financial news sources.

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:21.135
Focus on the summaries first.

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:25.515
If you can't do it daily, then rely
on monthly compilation reviews.

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:27.255
These are Lifesavers.

00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:32.295
Focus on the economy and banking
sections from trusted sources for

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:36.645
things that change often, like
policy rates or GDP forecasts, create

00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:40.600
flashcards for facts, digital or
physical, whatever works for you.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.240
For bigger concepts like monetary
policy, use mind maps, connect all the

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.790
tools like repo CRR and SLR to their
goals like controlling inflation.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.560
It makes a complex topic look
simple, and most importantly, do

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.450
a previous year question analysis.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.580
Regularly review old papers to see what
kind of updates are asked most often,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.920
and how much detail you really need.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.470
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:12.975
All right, listen up because here's
where many people lose marks.

00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:15.284
Let's avoid these common traps.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.955
A classic blunder is confusing.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:23.925
Similar terms mixing up repo rate and
reverse repo rate, or CPI and WPI.

00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:26.775
This sounds similar,
but our world's apart.

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:30.495
Another big one is using
outdated information.

00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:35.565
Relying on old data for economic
indicators is a recipe for disaster.

00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.275
Only the latest figures matter.

00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:41.125
Also, many friends ignore the context.

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:45.865
They memorize a fact, but don't
understand why a policy was introduced,

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:47.935
which leads to wrong conclusions.

00:07:48.354 --> 00:07:53.245
Sometimes you might overlook minor
details, thinking a specific number

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:57.669
or date is not important, but the
question might hinge on exactly that.

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:02.625
Be careful not to have a lack of
differentiation between general

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:06.555
news and news that is specifically
relevant to the banking sector.

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:11.055
And finally, don't fall into the
trap of misinterpreting cause and

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:15.345
effect assuming one event caused
another without understanding the

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:17.220
actual economic principles at play.

00:08:18.115 --> 00:08:22.645
W Edge Framework Summary to wrap
it all up in a neat little package.

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:24.445
Here's the W Edge framework.

00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:26.065
What is it all about?

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:30.655
Simply the latest developments in
business, economy, and finance.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:35.335
Why should you care to understand
market dynamics, policy impacts,

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:37.195
and the health of India's economy?

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.750
When is this relevant?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.890
It's a continuous process, but
your focus should be on the last

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.020
six to 12 months before your exam.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.910
Where does this news come from?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.770
It's global, national, and specific
to our banking and financial sectors.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.450
Who are the main players?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.910
The RBI, the Government of India,
sebi, IMF, world Bank, and all

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.655
the major banks and corporations.

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:02.975
And how does all this happen?

00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:07.415
Through policy changes, economic
data releases, financial market

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:12.155
movements, and major business
announcements fully worked out examples.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.025
Okay, let's test this
knowledge with some examples.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:23.380
Example, one question As of July,
2025, which of the following is the

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:30.040
primary objective of the Reserve Bank of
India's Monetary Policy Committee MPCA,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.770
maximizing employment opportunities.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.350
B, maintaining price stability while
keeping in mind the objective of growth.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.520
C. Ensuring a high rate of
foreign exchange reserves.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.800
D. Promoting equitable distribution
of wealth, understand the question

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.570
before moving to explanation.

00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:52.065
Let's crack this.

00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:53.175
Step one.

00:09:53.445 --> 00:09:57.525
The question is asking for the
main goal of the RBI's MPC.

00:09:57.885 --> 00:10:01.095
This is a conceptual question
about monetary policy.

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:04.695
Step two, recall the core job of the RBI.

00:10:04.995 --> 00:10:09.915
Its main mandate, especially for
the MPC, is to control inflation,

00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:14.200
but it has to do this while also
making sure the economy is growing.

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:15.575
Step three.

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.405
Let's look at the options.

00:10:17.675 --> 00:10:19.745
A is not the primary goal.

00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:24.275
C is a function of RBI,
but not the MPCs main job.

00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:28.595
D is a very broad goal for the
whole country, not a specific

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:29.465
monetary policy target.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.150
Option B, however perfectly captures this
dual focus, keep prices stable, control

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.490
inflation, but also consider growth.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.260
This is the correct balance.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:46.380
Step four, we conclude that option B is
the most accurate answer, correct answer.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:52.740
Option B. Example two question, which
international financial institution

00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.300
recently updated its growth forecast
for India to 6.4% for FY 26 and FY 27

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.970
citing resilient domestic fundamentals.

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:10.390
A World Bank B, international Monetary
Fund, IMFC, Asian Development Bank,

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:16.089
A DBD, world Trade Organization,
WTO understand the question

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:17.800
before moving to explanation a.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.069
Solution time.

00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:21.089
Step one.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.910
This is a fact-based
current affairs question.

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:25.979
You either know it or you don't.

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:30.780
It's asking to identify which body
gave a specific forecast for India.

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:35.099
Step two, think about who releases
these big economic reports.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.089
IMF, world Bank A DB
are the usual suspects.

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.795
Step three, try to recall recent news.

00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:46.415
The search results specifically
mentioned the IMFs World Economic

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:53.104
Outlook, and its revised forecast for
India to 6.4% for FY 26 and FY 27.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:58.834
The WTO focuses more on trade rules, not
these kinds of detailed growth forecasts.

00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:03.185
So based on the recent
information, the IMF is a culprit.

00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:07.324
Step four, conclude that the
IMF is the right answer here.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:10.905
Correct answer option B. Example three.

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:15.015
What is the term for the interest
rate at which commercial banks can

00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:19.245
borrow money from the Reserve Bank of
India for short-term needs by selling

00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:24.285
government securities with an agreement
to repurchase them a reverse repo rate?

00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:28.965
B Bank rate C repo rate DMSF rate.

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:32.025
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:35.115
Let's solve this final one.

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:39.105
Step one, the question is giving
a very specific definition

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:40.455
and asking for the term.

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:42.315
It's a conceptual question.

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.925
Step two, let's define our tools.

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:49.095
Repo rate is when banks borrow
from RBI by selling securities

00:12:49.215 --> 00:12:50.715
promising to buy them back.

00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:53.565
This description perfectly
matches the question.

00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:55.575
Reverse rate is the opposite.

00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:57.345
RBI borrows from banks.

00:12:57.635 --> 00:13:02.015
Bank rate is for long-term loans
without collateral, and MSF is an

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.025
emergency overnight borrowing rate.

00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:05.015
Step three.

00:13:05.314 --> 00:13:08.225
Compare the questions
description without definitions.

00:13:08.314 --> 00:13:09.485
It's a direct match.

00:13:09.694 --> 00:13:13.865
Step four, it's clear as
day, correct answer option C.

00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:14.885
Thank you.

00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:16.295
See you in the next lecture.
