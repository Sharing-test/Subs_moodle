00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on awards.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.120
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.760
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:15.225
So what are these awards
we keep hearing about?

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:21.615
Think of them as accolades, honors, or
prizes given to individuals, groups, or

00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:26.535
even entire organizations to give them a
pat on the back for their achievements.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:29.955
Contributions, or just being
excellent in their fields.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.000
In the context of general awareness
for your exam, understanding awards

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.110
means knowing their categories, the
fields they recognize, who the big

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.060
short recipients are, and maybe the year
they started or who won most recently.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.500
This topic is super crucial for
both current affairs and static

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.730
general knowledge, my friend.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.035
Real world relevance.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:56.084
You might be wondering, why
should I care who won what award?

00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:56.775
Ra?

00:00:56.804 --> 00:01:00.434
It's more relevant than you think
for current affairs knowledge.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:04.664
Staying updated on recent awards
helps you understand what's buzzing

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:09.164
nationally and internationally, which
is vital for a professional to get a

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:11.595
grip on economic and social trends.

00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:14.335
It also builds your
general knowledge base.

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:18.595
A strong awareness, including
awards, makes you sound smarter in

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:22.315
discussions and helps you understand
diverse client backgrounds.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.705
It even helps with decision
making, believe it or not.

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:30.685
Awareness of who society is recognizing
can subtly shape your perspective

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.055
leading to more well-rounded decisions.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:38.755
Even in finance and for public relations,
knowing about prominent people and their

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:42.985
achievements can be a great icebreaker
in client interactions for a bank.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:47.125
It also boosts cultural
understanding as awards often

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:48.925
reflect what a culture values.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.255
Finally, it sharpens
your analytical skills.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.929
Tracking award patterns helps
you develop skills to assess

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.104
market and social indicators.

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:03.345
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for the exam.

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:07.425
Questions on awards typically
come in a few favorite formats.

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:12.975
About 40% of the time, they will ask
who received which award, like who

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:18.375
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023,
around 30% of questions are about

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:20.205
matching the award to its field.

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:24.945
For example, the Pulitz surprise is
awarded for excellence in which field.

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:30.575
A smaller chunk, about 15% might test
your memory on the year of inception

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:35.404
or the very first recipient, like
when was the Parana first awarded?

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:40.054
Then you have about 10% on recent
announcements or controversies.

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:43.714
For instance, which country's
highest civilian honor was

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:45.799
recently conferred upon PM Modi.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.410
And the rarest at about 5%.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.750
Are questions linking an award to a
specific person or event, such as which

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.970
award is named after dadada Sahi Fal.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.650
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.190
Now for awards, you can
forget your math formulas.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.990
There are no equations here, but we
do have some fantastic memorization

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.390
techniques and categorization tricks.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.850
The first trick is categorization.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:15.695
Simply group the awards by
their field, like literature,

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.515
science, sports arts, and so on.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:24.305
Next, use acronyms or mnemonics, create
simple, silly phrases to remember

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.315
a list of winners or categories.

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:27.275
It works.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.940
Another great trick is association.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.070
Try to link a specific award to a very
famous recipient or a key feature.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.750
For example, when you think Nobel
Prize, you immediately think science,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.430
peace, or literature For historical
awards, create a timeline and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.590
associate them with major years or
events, and finally look for keywords.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.970
The names of awards often
give a clue, like kana, which

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.680
clearly points towards sports.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.900
Methods of solving.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.930
So how do you actually
solve these questions?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.280
The primary method, of course,
is direct recall for questions

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.080
asking Who got X award?

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.250
Your memory is your best friend,
but if your memory is being a bit

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.770
shy, use the process of elimination.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.610
If you're unsure, just get rid
of the options that are obviously

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.290
wrong based on what you do know.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.030
Sometimes you can find contextual
clues within the question itself that

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.950
can help you narrow down the choices.

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:30.960
A key strategy is to distinguish
between recent versus static questions.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.099
Know if you need current affairs,
knowledge or static gk, and

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.409
please focus on prominent awards.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.840
Prioritize memorizing the big ones.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.010
Parana.

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:47.219
Padma Awards, Nobel Prizes, Oscars Grammys
Arjuna Award and Drone Chaia Award.

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:49.735
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:51.505
Want some smart techniques.

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:56.305
Use flashcards, either digital or
physical for quick revision of award

00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:58.555
names, categories, and key winners.

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:03.235
Make a daily news, scan a habit,
regularly follow the news for award

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:07.440
announcements, especially those connected
to India and major international events.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.130
You can also create mind maps, which are
wonderful visual tools to connect awards

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.570
to their categories, famous recipients
and home countries, and of course,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.130
practice with mock tests to find your
weak spots and focus your energy there.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.750
A pro tip is to focus on
firsts and latest questions.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.605
Very often target the first ever recipient
of a major award, or the most recent one.

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:34.435
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:38.515
All right, listen up, because
here's where people often trip up.

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:43.525
A very common mistake is confusing
categories like thinking The Booker Prize

00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:45.565
is for science instead of literature.

00:05:45.955 --> 00:05:50.155
Another is getting the incorrect
year misremembering when an award

00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:52.115
started or when someone received it.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.290
People also make the mistake
of misidentifying recipients,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.330
especially when names are similar.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.550
A big trap is ignoring lesser known
awards, focusing only on the most famous

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.350
ones, and forgetting significant national
or state level awards can cost you marks

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.230
and please avoid outdated information.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.920
Always check the latest announcements
for current affairs based awards.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.880
Lastly, be careful with spelling
errors during your self-study

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.710
as it can lead to confusion.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.250
WH framework summary.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.750
So let's quickly summarize this
whole topic with the WH framework.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.099
What are awards?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.090
They are simply accolades or
prizes that recognize excellence.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.230
Why are they given to honor
achievements, encourage fresh talent

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.330
and acknowledge significant impact.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.710
When are they announced?

00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:44.295
Usually annually or periodically,
where are they given?

00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:48.675
They can be national, like our own
Indian awards or international, like the

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:51.405
Nobels from Sweden who receives them.

00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:56.505
It can be individuals, groups, or
organizations that show exceptional merit.

00:06:56.805 --> 00:06:58.005
And how are they awarded?

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:02.085
It's a formal process involving
nominations, selection committees,

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:03.585
and of course grant ceremonies.

00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:06.734
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:08.984
Example, one question.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:13.455
The ADA Sahe Falke Award is India's
highest honor In which field?

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:16.395
A, literature B, science.

00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:18.885
C, cinema, D Sports.

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.065
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:23.055
All right.

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:26.474
Step one is to understand the
question which asks for the

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:28.605
field of the D Sahi Falke Award.

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.825
Step two, recall your knowledge.

00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:35.534
The award is named after d Sahi
Falke, the father of Indian Cinema.

00:07:35.775 --> 00:07:37.125
This is a huge clue.

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.914
Step three is to evaluate your options.

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:45.020
Literature has awards like the
Science has, the Shanti Swer

00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:47.355
Prize Sports has the Arjuna Award.

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:48.164
Cinema.

00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.755
Perfectly aligns with DHIS legacy.

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:55.825
So in step four, we conclude that
the answer is C Cinema simple.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.065
Example two question.

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:01.995
Who among the following was the first
Indian to receive the Nobel Prize?

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:11.805
A C. B. Rab C. Mother Teresa understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:16.405
Okay, step one, the question wants
the first Indian Nobel laureate.

00:08:16.645 --> 00:08:20.245
Step two is to recall the years
for these famous personalities.

00:08:20.544 --> 00:08:26.965
Rabin received it in 1913 for literature
si Raman got it in 1930 for physics.

00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:33.294
Mother Teresa received it much later
in 1979 for peace and Ammar Sen got

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:35.845
his in 1998 for economic sciences.

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:38.534
Step three is to compare the years.

00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.145
1913 is the earliest, isn't it?

00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:47.085
So in step four, we easily conclude
that B Rab was the first Indian to

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:49.275
receive the Nobel Prize example.

00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:50.595
Three question.

00:08:50.775 --> 00:08:54.495
The PanIN is the second highest
civilian award of India.

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:57.255
Which of the following is
the highest civilian award?

00:08:57.845 --> 00:08:57.965
A

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.890
understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.360
Let's break this down.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.010
Step one, the question.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.540
States, Chen is second highest and
asks for the highest civilian award.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.365
Step two is to recall the hierarchy
of India's civilian awards.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:25.680
The order is parana at the top,
then pad then and finally ri.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.020
Step three is to check the options.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.260
Phan is third highest, RI is fourth.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.070
Para vi chakra is a military
gallantry award, so it's out.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.540
This leaves us with Parana, which is
indeed the highest civilian award.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.550
So step four, our clear
answer is thank you.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.200
See you in the next lecture.
