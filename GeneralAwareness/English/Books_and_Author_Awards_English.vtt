00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on books and authors awards.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.330
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.940
All right, let's start with the basics.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.940
What are these books and authors awards?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
Think of them as the film fair or
Oscars For the literary world, it's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.020
all about giving a big shout out and
a shiny trophy to writers and their

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.040
amazing books for their outstanding
contributions to literature.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.795
These awards celebrate the best of
the best across different genres,

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.165
languages, and even formats.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:44.205
They are super important because they
shine a spotlight on incredible talent.

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:48.940
Encourage all of us to read more and
help preserve our rich cultural heritage.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.570
Now for your exam.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.960
This topic is a gold mine
under general awareness.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.970
It's a clever way for examiners to check
if you're up to date with current affairs,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.590
cultural happenings, and the big names
in the literary universe, both from

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.020
our own country and around the world.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.280
Real world re.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:13.315
You might be thinking, why should
I care about who won what award?

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:17.125
Well, my friend, knowing about
these things does wonders

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:18.325
for your general knowledge.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:23.095
It makes you sound smart and well
informed, which is a fantastic quality.

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.625
In any professional setting.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:29.575
Imagine impressing a client or your
boss just by casually mentioning

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:31.255
a recent Booker Prize winner.

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:35.414
This awareness contributes to
a well-rounded personality and

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:38.145
helps you connect with people
from different backgrounds.

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:42.225
It's not just about exams,
it's about being more engaged

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.199
with the world around us.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:48.345
Breakdown of question types based
on what we've seen in past papers.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:51.765
The questions on this topic
love to follow a pattern.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:57.825
First and most frequently, about 35
to 40% of the time, you'll get author

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.565
and book name matching questions.

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:00.405
Simple.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.290
Who wrote this or which
book did she write?

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:09.155
Next up with a 30 to 35% frequency
is award and winner matching.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:14.375
Here they'll ask you to match the award
with the person who won it or vice versa.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:20.795
A slightly trickier type appearing 15 to
20% of the time is about award details.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.230
These questions dig a little deeper,
asking about the year an award was

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.720
started, the specific field it covers, or
which country gives it out, and finally

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.060
making up 10 to 15% of the questions are
the current affairs ones focusing on the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.370
latest winners from the last year or two.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.125
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:42.704
So how do you remember all this?

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:43.785
Don't worry.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:45.555
I have some tricks up my sleeve.

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.555
First, use acronyms or mnemonics.

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.135
Create silly little phrases to remember.

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:53.834
Author book pairs, the sillier the better.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:59.660
Second try association Link an author or
a book with something unique about them.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.150
Their style, A major theme or
even a funny picture you saw.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.079
Third categorization is
your best friend group.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.950
The awards logically, for instance,
all Indian awards in one list,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.590
international ones in another, and so on.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.350
It makes the information
less overwhelming.

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.810
Lastly, focus on keywords.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.440
When you are studying, just
highlight the author's name, the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.600
book's title, and the award name.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.380
That's the golden Triangle of
information you need to recall.

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.895
Methods of solving when
you are in the exam hall.

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.845
Here's how to tackle these questions.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:38.055
The first method is, of
course, direct recall.

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:42.915
If you know the answer, you know the
answer, just trust your memory and market.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:44.835
But what if you are unsure?

00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:46.845
Use the elimination method.

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:51.315
Look at the options, and kick out the
ones you know are definitely wrong.

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:55.275
This dramatically increases your
chances of guessing the right one.

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:59.204
Sometimes the question itself
gives you contextual clues.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.239
It might mention a genre, the author's
nationality, or a time period that

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.070
can help you zero in on the correct
choice and a pro tip for preparation.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.350
Always start with the latest updates.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.329
First recent award winners are hot
topics and are very frequently asked.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:18.465
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:22.365
Want some smart techniques
follow the last two years rule.

00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:26.655
Concentrate your energy on the
major awards like the gpi, Saia

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:31.365
Academy, Booker Pulitzer, and the
Nobel Prize in literature that were

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:33.105
announced in the last two years.

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:36.875
Also always keep an eye out
for an Indian connection.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:41.555
If an Indian author wins an international
award or a book is about India,

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:43.565
it becomes extremely important.

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:50.585
Make a list of prominent authors
like Rab Tag Muhi pre A and ATI

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:52.925
Roy, and memorize their major works.

00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:55.925
Finally, nothing beats revision cycles.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:00.695
A quick, daily, or weekly revision will
keep this information fresh in your mind.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:03.045
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:06.075
Now, let's talk about
the traps you must avoid.

00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:08.475
A very common one is confusing.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.285
Similar names.

00:05:09.555 --> 00:05:11.205
Always double check spellings.

00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:13.335
Don't mix your sets and your rashes.

00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:17.475
Another big mistake is relying
on outdated information.

00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:21.435
Awards are annual, so that all
GK book from your cousin is

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.995
probably not going to help.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:24.345
Stay up to date.

00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:27.705
Also, don't just focus
on the big name awards.

00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:31.095
Sometimes questions pop up
from significant but lesser

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.325
known regional awards.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:36.765
Be careful about misattributing
genres, knowing that an author

00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:40.845
primarily writes poetry can help you
eliminate an option about a novel.

00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:44.855
Lastly, please don't
differentiate awards incorrectly.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:49.175
Understand the difference between, say,
the gpi, which is a lifetime achievement

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:55.025
award, and the Sahi the Academy, which is
for a specific book, WH framework summary.

00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:59.045
So to wrap it all up quickly,
what is this topic about?

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.985
It's about recognition
for literary excellence.

00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:06.155
Why is it important to promote
literature and acknowledge talent?

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.920
When are these awards given
usually annually for recent

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.780
work or lifetime contributions?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.039
Where are they given both nationally
in India and internationally?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.210
Who is involved?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.800
Authors receive them and we readers
benefit and how does it work?

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.080
Through nominations and judging panels.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.400
See simple.

00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:27.315
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.974
Let's try a few questions to
see how this works in practice.

00:06:31.335 --> 00:06:33.224
Example, one question.

00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:38.145
Who among the following is the author of
the famous novel, the God of Small Things?

00:06:38.594 --> 00:06:39.495
A Vikram.

00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:46.724
Seth, b Arun, c Ri d, Salman
Rushdi understand the question

00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:48.344
before moving to explanation.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.040
The question asks for the
author of a very famous book.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.400
You should recall that the
God of Small Things was a huge

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.170
hit and won the Booker Prize.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.170
The author is the celebrated Arun Roy.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.430
If we look at the other options,
Vikram, Seth wrote a suitable Boy.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.220
Jri is famous for the namesake, and
Salman Rashti gave us midnight's children.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.855
So the clear answer is
B. Example two question.

00:07:15.155 --> 00:07:19.415
The GPE Ward, one of India's highest
literary honors, is given for

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:24.605
outstanding contribution to which
field A, science and technology B,

00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.055
literature C sports, D, social work.

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:30.905
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:33.465
This one is quite straightforward.

00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:36.015
The question itself contains the answer.

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:37.995
It calls the GPI award.

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:41.985
One of India's highest literary
honors the word literary

00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:43.665
points directly to literature.

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:47.565
The other options like science,
sports, and social work are

00:07:47.565 --> 00:07:49.005
completely different fields.

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:51.105
Therefore, the correct option is.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.600
Example three question.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.490
Which of the following books won the
International Booker Prize in 2022?

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.490
A Tomb of Sand by Gitanjali Ri.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.110
B. The Seven Moons of Mali,
Almeida by Shahan, AKA.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.689
C Milkman by Anna Burns.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.520
D. The Discomfort of Evening by
Marika Lucas Reinfeld Understand the

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.650
question before moving to explanation.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.849
This question tests your knowledge
of recent very important awards.

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:24.500
The key here is International
Booker Prize and the year 2022.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.460
This was a historic win because
it went to an Indian author's

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.320
translated work for the first time.

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:33.620
The correct book is Tomb
of Sand by Git, angel Ri.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.135
To be sure.

00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:36.304
Let's check the others.

00:08:36.694 --> 00:08:41.614
The seven moons of Mali Almeida won
the Booker Prize in 2022, not the

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:48.035
International Booker Milkman one in 2018
and the discomfort of evening one in 2020.

00:08:48.334 --> 00:08:51.364
So the correct answer is a thank you.

00:08:51.694 --> 00:08:52.829
See you in the next lecture.
