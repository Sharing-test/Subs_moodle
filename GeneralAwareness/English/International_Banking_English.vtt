00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on international banking.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.230
Let's decode this concept like
detectives concept, explanation.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.200
So what is this big shot?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.370
International banking all about.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.475
It's just banking that has packed
its bags and gone on a world tour.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:25.515
It refers to all banking activities
that cross national borders.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.075
We are talking about financial
transactions and services provided

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:34.845
by banks to individuals, businesses,
and even entire governments

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.200
across different countries.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.865
It's what facilitates international
trade, manages all that foreign exchange

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:47.145
drama handles cross-border investments
and juggles the financial risks that

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.275
come with play on a global field.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:54.315
Honestly, it's absolutely essential
for our globally interconnected

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:59.235
economy, ensuring the smooth flow
of capital and commerce worldwide.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:01.665
Real world relevance.

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:04.635
And why should you care about this?

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:05.205
You ask.

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:10.155
Simple understanding international
banking helps you become a star

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:14.625
in client advisory, giving advice
on foreign trade finance and

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:16.875
international investment opportunities.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:21.945
It's also crucial for currency
management that is managing foreign

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:26.385
currency transactions and mitigating
those pesky exchange rate risks.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:31.745
Furthermore, it allows for sharp
economic analysis helping you assess

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:36.695
global economic trends that impact
bank operations and client portfolios.

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.965
And we cannot forget global compliance.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:44.885
It's all about navigating the complex
maze of international regulations

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:49.385
and compliance requirements,
breakdown of question types.

00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:51.705
Now for your exam.

00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:55.065
Questions on this topic
follow a predictable pattern.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.554
A huge chunk about 35% will be
on definitions and concepts.

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.925
They'll ask you to define terms like
Swift, L-I-B-O-R, correspondent banking,

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.865
and the famous Nostri and vostro accounts.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.920
Next up taking 25% of the spotlight
are regulatory bodies and agreements,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.079
meaning questions about the big
bosses like the IMF and World Bank, or

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.510
important rules like the basal accords.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.230
Then with 20% come functions and services,
questions about what these banks actually

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.929
do, like trade, finance, or remittances.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:38.045
A smaller 10% chunk is for instruments
and mechanisms focusing on specific

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:39.815
tools like letters of credit.

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:45.545
Finally, another 10% is for current
affairs, covering recent news and

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.885
changes in global financial policies.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:51.695
So stay updated formulas and tricks.

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:56.355
For general awareness formulas
are more like memory tricks.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:01.365
To keep things straight, let's make
some associations for Swift Think

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:06.225
Society for World Interbank Financial
Telecommunication, it's the global

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:08.685
messaging system for secure transactions.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.459
For L-I-B-O-R, which is now mostly
replaced by SOR or Sonia, just remember

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.980
it as the London Interbank offered rate
an old benchmark for international loans.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.420
Now for the confusing cousins, nostri
account means our money with your bank.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.920
Vostro account is the opposite.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.690
Your money with our bank and
Loro account is their money with

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.970
their bank seen from our angle.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.940
Forex is easy for an exchange.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.799
Just swapping one currency for
another, a letter of credit or Elsie,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.149
is a bank's promise of payment to
a seller, a true payment guarantee.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.380
And finally, the basal accords
are the international rule book

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.640
for banks on capital adequacy,
stress testing, and market risk.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.960
Methods of solving.

00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:02.805
Solving these questions is all
about how you organize information.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.775
First, focus on conceptual understanding.

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:09.585
Don't just memorize, grasp
the core definition and the

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:11.145
why behind each concept.

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:16.305
Second, for acronyms like Swift or
IMF, you must know the full form.

00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:20.954
Third, practice role identification
for any organization.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:24.170
Identify its primary role
in the financial system.

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:27.745
Fourth, get good at
distinction and comparison.

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:33.115
Understand the subtle differences between
similar terms like nostri versus vostro.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.115
Finally, think contextual application.

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:40.195
Imagine where and when a particular
instrument would be used in

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:41.635
a real international deal.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:44.215
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:46.965
Want some smart techniques?

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:47.955
Of course you do.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:50.594
First, use keywords association.

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:54.645
Link SWIFT to messaging and
lc to payment guarantee.

00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:55.364
Simple.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.005
Second, practice categorization.

00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:03.104
Mentally group terms into buckets
like organizations or payment systems.

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.844
This keeps your brain tidy.

00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:08.114
Third, use the power
of elimination in MQs.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.995
If you're not sure, get rid of
the obviously wrong answers.

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:12.415
First.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.755
Fourth, do a recent news scan.

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:17.905
Keep an eye on major
financial news for updates.

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:22.825
Finally, always focus on core
function For any term, just

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.805
ask yourself what does it do?

00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:29.185
This simple question cuts
through all the jargon, common

00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:31.015
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:33.435
The common traps.

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:34.665
Let's avoid them.

00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:38.715
A classic mistake is confusing
the IMF and the World Bank.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:43.155
Remember, the IMF focuses on
global monetary cooperation

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.655
and financial stability.

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:49.035
The World Bank focuses on poverty
reduction and development assistance.

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:52.725
Another big one is mixing
up nostri and vostro.

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:56.835
Remember the mantra, nostri
is our bank's account abroad.

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:59.535
Vostro is their bank's account with us.

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:02.585
Also don't make the mistake of thinking.

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:04.145
L-I-B-O-R is still primary.

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:08.345
It has been largely phased out
for rates like SOR and Sonia.

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:13.565
Many also ignored the basal accords,
but their principles influence banking

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.355
regulations globally affecting all banks.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:19.745
Lastly, don't overlook
correspondent banking.

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.595
It's fundamental for
cross-border transactions.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.295
WH framework summary.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.805
So to summarize the theory,
let's use the WH framework.

00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:30.795
What is it?

00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:34.335
Simply banking activities,
crossing national borders,

00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:36.375
facilitating global finance.

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:42.015
Why does it exist to enable international
trade investment and capital flow?

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:43.995
Ensuring financial stability.

00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:45.285
When is it used?

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:49.155
When anyone engages in cross
border financial transactions?

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.420
Where does this happen in
global financial markets?

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:55.094
International trade and remittances.

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:56.445
Who are the players?

00:06:56.745 --> 00:07:01.094
Multinational corporations,
importers, exporters, international

00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:03.135
organizations and individuals.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:04.635
And how does it work?

00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:09.495
Through foreign exchange, trade, finance,
instruments, correspondent banking

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.685
and international payment systems.

00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:14.445
Fully worked out Examples.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.115
All right, theory is done.

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:20.025
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:22.034
Example one.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.684
Question, which of the following
International financial messaging

00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:31.724
systems is primarily used by banks
worldwide for secure and standardized

00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.914
exchange of financial transactions?

00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:41.864
A-R-T-G-S-B-N-E-F-T-C, swift,
DUPI understand the question

00:07:41.864 --> 00:07:43.215
before moving to explanation.

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:46.395
Step one is to analyze the question.

00:07:46.605 --> 00:07:49.965
It asks for an international
financial messaging system.

00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:52.755
Step two is to evaluate the options.

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:58.815
R-T-G-S-N-E-F-T and UPI are all
domestic Indian payment systems you see.

00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:03.795
But swift, the Society for World
Interbank Financial Telecommunication

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:07.515
is the global network used by
banks for secure messaging.

00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:11.445
So based on this analysis,
swift is the correct answer,

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:15.255
correct answer, C. Example two.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.740
Question.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.440
A bank in India opens an account with a
bank in the USA to facilitate transactions

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.659
in US dollars from the perspective of the
Indian bank, what is this account called?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.490
A Vostro account.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.229
B Loro account.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.090
C, nostri account.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.500
D, escrow account.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.020
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, let's

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.370
understand the scenario.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.820
An Indian bank opens an
account in an American bank.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.030
The question asks for the
Indian bank's perspective.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.190
Let's recall our little trick.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.250
Nostri means our money with your bank.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.010
Vostro is your money with our bank.

00:08:55.505 --> 00:09:00.035
Since the Indian Bank, our bank is
holding an account with the USA Bank.

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:00.814
Your bank.

00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:03.935
It is a Nostri account from
the Indian Bank's perspective.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:08.495
So simple, correct
answer C. Example three.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:14.775
Question, which international organization
primarily aims to foster global

00:09:14.775 --> 00:09:19.935
monetary cooperation, secure financial
stability, facilitate international

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:24.344
trade, promote high employment and
sustainable economic growth, and

00:09:24.344 --> 00:09:26.234
reduce poverty around the world.

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:33.455
A World Bank, B World Trade Organization,
C. International Monetary Fund, D,

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:38.345
Asian Development Bank, understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:41.735
The key here is to look at
all the objectives listed.

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.964
The World Bank focuses
on poverty reduction.

00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:47.454
The WTO deals with trade rules.

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:53.185
A DB is a regional bank for Asia, but
the IMF core mission is to ensure the

00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:57.925
stability of the international monetary
system, which covers global monetary

00:09:57.925 --> 00:10:00.204
cooperation and financial stability.

00:10:00.564 --> 00:10:04.525
The comprehensive set of objectives
mentioned in the question directly

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:10.104
aligns with the mission of the
IMF, correct answer C. Thank you.

00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:11.665
See you in the next lecture.
