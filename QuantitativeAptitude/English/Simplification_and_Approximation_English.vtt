00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.220
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on simplification and approximation.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.800
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.880
This is it.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.350
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.510
All right, my friends.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.840
Let's talk about simplification
and approximation.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.770
Two topics that are absolutely
fundamental in quantitative

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.870
aptitude for your competitive exams.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.030
These aren't just fancy words.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.600
They're critical skills that
test your ability to perform

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.210
calculations quickly and accurately.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.585
Think of it as your mind's agility test.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.144
First up, simplification.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:39.824
This involves taking a big, messy
mathematical expression and tidying

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:41.925
it up into a much simpler form.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:47.955
The superhero behind this entire process
is a beloved bodmas or pemdas rule.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:52.185
This rule, my friends, dictates
the sacred order of operations.

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:55.724
Get this wrong and your
calculations will go for a toss.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:56.504
Trust me.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:59.054
So what's this board mass mantra?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.680
B or P. It stands for brackets
or parenthesis, whatever's inside

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.660
those brackets, you tackle it first.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.150
No excuses, O or E. Next,
we have orders or exponents.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
This includes all those powers,
square roots, cube roots.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.730
They come after the brackets.

00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:21.994
D or M, then it's division
and multiplication.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:23.854
These two are like siblings.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:28.804
They have equal priority, so you just
perform them from left to right as

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:34.354
they appear in the expression A or S.
And finally, addition and subtraction.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:38.315
Again, same priority, so
you move from left to right.

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:42.905
Understanding and strictly adhering
to this BO mass rule is not just

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.535
crucial, it's non-negotiable
for accurate simplification.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.690
Any tiny deviation from this order will
lead you down the wrong mathematical path.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.240
And believe me, it's a long way back.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.120
Now, let's talk about approximation.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.600
As the name very clearly
suggests, this isn't about

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.640
getting the exact, exact answer.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.990
No know my friends.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
It's about finding a value that's
close enough to the real answer.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:09.895
And why is this super useful?

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:10.465
You ask?

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:14.815
Well, in your competitive exams,
options are often quite spaced out,

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:19.405
so a quick intelligent estimation
can save you precious minutes.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:23.605
The secret sauce here is rounding
of numbers to their nearest whole

00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:27.865
numbers or significant figures to
make those calculations a breeze.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.715
What are the common rounding
rules for approximation?

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.745
When you are rounding to the nearest
hole number, if the decimal part

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:38.705
is 0.5 or greater, you simply
round up to the next hole number.

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:44.165
For example, 7.6 becomes a nice
round eight, but if it's less

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:48.995
than 0.5, you graciously round
down like 7.3, staying as seven.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.860
And for rounding to the nearest tens,
hundreds, or thousands, you just

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.730
peak at the digit immediately to the
right of your desired rounding place.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.160
If it's five or greater, you round up.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.780
Otherwise you round down.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.450
It's like magic, but with numbers.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.380
Remember, approximation isn't
about pinpoint accuracy.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.190
It's about getting a value that's
sufficiently close to the exact

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.390
answer, so you can confidently pick the
right option from the given choices.

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:20.704
This skill truly requires a good
sense of number, magnitude and some

00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:22.565
lightning fast mental arithmetic.

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:26.795
Both simplification and approximation
are heavily reliant on your

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:28.445
strong foundational knowledge.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:33.065
We are talking basic arithmetic,
fractions, decimals percentages,

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:36.785
knowing your squares cubes, and
those multiplication tables.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:41.525
Master these concepts and you'll see
a significant boost in your speed and

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.924
accuracy when solving these problems.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.590
It's like having superpowers for numbers.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.540
Real world relevance.

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.430
Now let's connect this to the real
world, especially in the banking sector.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.890
My friends, simplification and
approximation are not just exam topics.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.149
They are critical for rapid
decision making and risk assessment.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.340
Imagine bank tellers or loan officers,
they frequently use quick mental

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.230
calculations to verify transactions,
estimate loan repayments, or even

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.510
assess interest accruals on the fly.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.550
This proficiency ensures efficient
customer service and accurate preliminary

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.955
financial evaluations, minimizing
errors in a fast-paced environment.

00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:29.545
It also helps in quickly understanding
complex financial reports and

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:33.565
market data, allowing for timely
responses to economic shifts.

00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:39.235
So you see it's not just about Marx,
it's about making smart, quick financial

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:42.175
decisions, breakdown of question types.

00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:44.955
All right, let's dissect
the question types.

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:48.195
You'll encounter simplification
and approximation.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:51.075
Questions are a pretty big
deal in the quantitative

00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:52.935
aptitude section of your exam.

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:57.255
They often account for a substantial
number of marks, so pay attention

00:04:57.615 --> 00:04:59.475
based on past exam patterns.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:02.685
These questions generally
fall into two main categories.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.630
First, we have pure simplification, which
makes up about 60 to 70% of the questions.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.440
These involve complex mathematical
expressions that demand

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.430
simplification using our friend,
the Bodmas or Pemdas rule.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.620
They're like a mixed bag of operations,
addition, subtraction, multiplication,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.285
division, percentages, fractions,
decimals, squares, cubes, and even roots.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.240
The ultimate goal here, my friends, is
to land on an exact numerical value.

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:34.285
No approximations allowed here.

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:36.055
It's precision all the way.

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:40.915
Then there's approximation
accounting for roughly 30 to 40%.

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:45.055
These questions challenge you to
find an approximate value of a given

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:48.985
expression by smartly rounding off
numbers to their nearest integers.

00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:50.455
All significant figures.

00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:54.360
This type of question truly
tests your ability to estimate

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.640
quickly and accurately.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.900
Especially when you are dealing with
those big numbers, tricky decimals or

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.450
complex calculations where an exact answer
isn't needed, but a smart close estimate

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.520
is enough to nail the right option.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.000
Within these broad categories,
the questions can involve

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.560
a few interesting twists.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.060
Missing term or question mark problems,
you'll see a question mark, and your

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.290
job is to find that missing value after
either simplifying or approximating.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:22.925
Equation solving.

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:27.485
Sometimes simple linear equations or
expressions that need to be solved

00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:29.375
for an unknown variable will pop up.

00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:31.355
Percentage-based calculations.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:32.315
Oh yes.

00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:35.945
Questions heavily involving
percentages of numbers, often mixed

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:40.414
with other operations are a common
site fraction and decimal operations.

00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:43.925
These require careful handling
of fractions and decimals.

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:45.460
No silly mistakes here, my friends.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.410
Powers and roots get ready for
calculations involving squares,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.840
cubes, square roots, and cube roots.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.150
Honestly, simplification and approximation
questions are considered scoring topics.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.660
Why?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.980
Because they're direct, provided you
have strong calculation skills and a

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.210
crystal clear understanding of the order
of operations and rounding techniques.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.930
These are your golden tickets to
building speed and confidence in

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.640
the quantitative aptitude section.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.260
Don't underestimate them.

00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:16.515
Formulas and tricks.

00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:21.735
Now for the fun part, mastering
simplification and approximation

00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:25.275
for your exam isn't just about
knowing basic arithmetic.

00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:30.195
It's about employing some super
specific formulas and clever tricks

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:32.355
to boost your speed and accuracy.

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:37.275
Let's dive in one Bodmas or PDA's Rule.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:44.940
Order of operations, B or P or
parenthesis, always the first priority.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:52.260
No negotiation, O or e orders or exponent
powers, square roots, cube roots.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.430
They come next.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.510
D or M division and multiplication
from left to right, like reading a

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.050
book, A or S addition and subtraction
again, from left to right trick.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.370
Always, always, always
follow this order Strictly.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.560
A common blunder is performing addition
before multiplication or division.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.210
Don't be that friend.

00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:19.905
Percentage conversions.

00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:24.165
Trick, memorize, common percentage
to fraction conversions.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:27.255
This is a game changer
for quick calculations.

00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:32.655
For example, a hundred percent
is just one 50% is one by two.

00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:35.485
33.33% is one by three.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:40.285
25% is one by four, 20% is one by five.

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:43.315
16.66% is one by six.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:46.165
14.28% is one by seven.

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.715
12.5% is one by eight.

00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:51.475
11.11% is one by nine.

00:08:51.715 --> 00:08:53.275
10% is one by 10.

00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:56.035
9.09% is one by 11.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:09:01.645
8.33% is one by 12,
and 6.25% is one by 16.

00:09:01.885 --> 00:09:03.595
Learn these by heart my friend.

00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:06.734
For percentages, like 40% of two 50.

00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:10.484
Instead of calculating with
decimals, think of it as two by

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:14.175
five multiplied by two 50, which
directly gives you a hundred.

00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:20.234
Or if it's 120% of 50, break it
down a hundred percent of 50 plus.

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:24.615
20% of 50, so that's 50
plus 10 giving you 60.

00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:25.469
Smart right.

00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:28.155
Three squares and cubes.

00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:32.655
Trick memorize squares up
to 30 and cubes up to 20.

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:38.445
This isn't just a suggestion, it's a time
saving superpower For larger squares,

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:40.605
pull out your algebra identities.

00:09:40.845 --> 00:09:44.595
Remember, A plus B whole square
equals A square plus two.

00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:49.225
AB plus B. Or A minus B hole
square equals a square minus

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:51.295
two AB plus B square Use them.

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:55.975
For instance, 47 square can be
seen as 50 minus three square.

00:09:56.215 --> 00:10:02.605
That's 50 square minus two times 50 times
three plus three square, which is 2,500

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:07.105
minus 300 plus nine, resulting in 2,209.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.160
Much faster than direct multiplication.

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:14.025
Four multiplication tricks
multiplying by 5 25.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:23.805
1 25 x five, simple X into 10 by
two x 25 think x 200 by four x 1 25.

00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:25.560
It's x 2000 by eight.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.330
Multiplying by 9 99.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:35.230
9 9 9 x into nine is just x into 10
minus one equals 10 x minus x. X into

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.780
99 is X into a hundred minus one.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.920
You get the pattern right base
method for numbers near a hundred.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.290
This is quite neat example.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.870
Let's multiply 96 by 98.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.240
96 is four less than a hundred.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.314
98 is two less than a hundred.

00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:57.675
Now cross subtract 96 minus
two or 98 minus four equals 94.

00:10:57.885 --> 00:10:59.444
These are your first two digits.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:04.364
Then multiply the differences minus
four into minus two equals eight.

00:11:04.574 --> 00:11:09.944
This is your last two digits, but
write it as zero eight result 9 4 0 8.

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:10.959
Isn't that clever?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.860
Five digital sum method for
simplification use with caution.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.240
The digital sum of a number is
simply the sum of its digits repeated

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.770
until you get a single digit.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.920
For example, the digital sum of 25 is two
plus five equals seven in simplification.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.220
The digital sum of your question
should match the digital sum

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.080
of the correct answer trick.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.460
This method can be incredibly fast for
quick checks, but please, my friend.

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:38.805
Use it with caution.

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:40.215
It has limitations.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:44.235
For instance, if two options have
the same digital sum, or if you're

00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:47.385
dealing with approximation, it
might not be your best friend.

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:51.255
Use it as a quick confirmation,
not your primary solving method.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:56.385
Six approximation rules, rounding
to nearest integer, just round

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:58.095
decimals to the nearest whole number.

00:11:58.345 --> 00:12:02.845
If the decimal part is 0.5 or more
round up, otherwise round down.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:10.405
So 45.67 becomes about 46 and 12.34
becomes a neat 12 rounding for

00:12:10.405 --> 00:12:16.735
percentages, round percentages to easily
calculable values, like 39.8% of 200,

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.765
roughly 40% of 200, which is a quick 80.

00:12:20.555 --> 00:12:24.245
Rounding for division round, both
the numerator and the denominator

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:25.415
to make division simpler.

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:32.675
For instance, 498 divided by 25.9,
approximated as 500 divided by 25,

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.585
which gives you 20 easy peasy trick.

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.235
Always I repeat.

00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:40.444
Always look at the options
before you start approximating.

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:44.224
If the options are miles apart, you
can be aggressive with your rounding,

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:48.214
but if they're huddled close together,
then my friend, you need to be a

00:12:48.214 --> 00:12:49.745
bit more precise with your rounding.

00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:51.485
It's all about context.

00:12:51.785 --> 00:12:54.755
Seven unit digit method
for simplification.

00:12:54.844 --> 00:12:55.594
Limited use.

00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:59.655
In some cases, especially with
multiplication or addition, just

00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:03.735
checking the unit digit of your result
can help you eliminate options benefit.

00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:08.145
This is super fast for eliminating
options if the unit digits are distinct.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:12.315
But remember a small disclaimer,
it doesn't work for division or

00:13:12.315 --> 00:13:15.825
approximation, and if multiple
options share the same unit digit,

00:13:15.975 --> 00:13:17.220
well then it's not much help.

00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:21.815
These formulas and tricks when
practiced regularly, can significantly

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:25.295
boost your speed and accuracy in
the quantitative aptitude section.

00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:29.285
They're your secret weapons,
my friend, methods of solving.

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.145
All right, my friends.

00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:36.455
Solving simplification and approximation
problems efficiently in your exam

00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:38.435
demands a structured approach.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.165
Let's break down the step-by-step methods.

00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:46.685
One for simplification
problems, exact value, step one.

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:49.245
Apply Bo Mass or Pemdas rule.

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.415
This is the undisputed
champion, the most crucial step.

00:13:53.805 --> 00:13:57.285
Always perform operations
in the correct sacred order.

00:13:57.615 --> 00:14:02.055
First, attack those expressions
inside brackets or parentheses.

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:08.444
Next diligently evaluate orders, which
means powers, roots, and exponent.

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:12.735
Then it's time for division
and multiplication, always

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:14.175
moving from left to right.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:19.485
Finally carry out addition and
subtraction again, from left to right.

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.860
Step two, convert
percentages and fractions.

00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:27.125
If your expression is flaunting
percentages or mixed fractions,

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:30.755
quickly convert them into
simple fractions or decimals.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.665
This makes calculations so much easier.

00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:41.225
For example, 25% becomes one fourth,
33, 1 by 3% becomes one third and two,

00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:43.655
one and a half, converts to five by two.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.445
Step three, simplify step by step.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.550
Don't try to swallow the
whole elephant at once.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.080
Break down the complex expression
into smaller, more manageable parts.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.300
Solve one operation at a time.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.430
Strictly adhering to Bo mass.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.410
Patience is key here, my friend.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.490
Step four.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.620
Use mental math and memorized values.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.030
This is where all your hard work pays off.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.130
Use your amazing knowledge of squares,
cubes, multiplication tables, and

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.330
those common percentage to fraction
conversions to zoom through calculations.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.210
Step five, be meticulous with signs.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.860
Positive, negative.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.140
These little signs can wreak havoc.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.895
If you're not careful, pay close
attention to them, especially

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:29.050
during multiplication and division.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.380
One wrong sign and poof,
your answer is gone.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:35.095
Step six, recheck calculations.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:39.415
If time permits, a quick smart
recheck of your steps can save you

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.275
from those sneaky, silly errors.

00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:43.885
It's like a final quality control check.

00:15:44.185 --> 00:15:47.635
Two for approximation
problems, approximate value.

00:15:47.935 --> 00:15:49.510
Step one, round off numbers.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.840
This is the holy grail for approximation.

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:57.220
The very first and most vital step
is to round off all the numbers

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.150
in your expression to the nearest
whole numbers of values that are

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.980
super convenient for calculation.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:09.970
For example, 49.87 happily becomes
50 12.3 simplifies to 12, and

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.960
24.9% gets rounded to a nice 25%.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.985
Step two, apply board mass or
pemdas rule to rounded numbers.

00:16:18.715 --> 00:16:23.245
Once your numbers are all neatly
rounded, go ahead and apply the Bodmas

00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:25.045
rule to this simplified expression.

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:27.385
Step three, perform operations.

00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:31.165
Now simply carry out the
arithmetic operations using

00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:32.665
your newly rounded values.

00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:34.660
Step four, estimate the result.

00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:38.035
The number you get will
be your approximate value.

00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:40.585
Compare this beauty
with the options given.

00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:43.315
Step five, choose the closest option.

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:47.845
Pick the option that is the closest match
to your calculated, approximate value.

00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:50.935
Sometimes two options
might look like twins.

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:55.285
In such cases, a slightly more
precise rounding or a quick mental

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:57.565
recalculation might be your best bet.

00:16:57.895 --> 00:17:00.085
Step six, understand the range.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:04.865
Remember, approximation means you are
looking for a value within a certain

00:17:04.865 --> 00:17:07.145
ballpark, not an exact bullseye.

00:17:07.355 --> 00:17:10.954
The options in approximation
questions are usually spaced out

00:17:10.954 --> 00:17:12.395
enough to give you this leeway.

00:17:12.694 --> 00:17:16.264
General tips applicable to
both practice regularly.

00:17:16.415 --> 00:17:18.214
This is just advise my friend.

00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:19.234
It's the key.

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:24.694
Consistent practice is absolutely vital
for improving both your speed and accuracy

00:17:24.694 --> 00:17:27.004
in simplification and approximation.

00:17:27.385 --> 00:17:28.855
Identify question type.

00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:32.215
Before you even pick up your
pen, quickly figure out if the

00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:34.225
question demands an exact answer.

00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:36.745
Simplification or an approximate one.

00:17:36.865 --> 00:17:37.795
Approximation.

00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:41.965
This saves you from doing extra work
or making an incorrect assumption.

00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.635
Work from left to right for same priority.

00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:45.325
Operations.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.659
For operations like division and
multiplication or addition and

00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:53.770
subtraction, always be a discipline
friend and work from left to right.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.600
By following these systematic methods,
you can truly conquer simplification

00:17:58.629 --> 00:18:03.429
and approximation problems in
your exam, shortcuts and smart

00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:09.189
techniques to truly maximize your
speed and accuracy in simplification

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.840
and approximation questions.

00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:16.215
Especially when that exam pressure
kicks in, you absolutely must employ

00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:18.585
these shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:24.885
Think of them as your secret ninja
moves, one, learn tables, squares,

00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:28.754
cubes, and powers shortcut my friend.

00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:30.225
This is non-negotiable.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.180
Memorize multiplication tables up
to 20, squares up to 30, cubes up

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.020
to 20, and powers of 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:45.060
To a reasonable extent, this is
hands down, the single most effective

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.880
way to save precious time benefit.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.680
Direct recall eliminates any need for
calculating these basic operations.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.890
It's like having an instant
answer button in your brain.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.730
Two master percentage
to fraction conversions.

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:04.290
Shortcut, get to know common
percentage equivalence, infractions,

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.970
like the back of your hand.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:13.980
For example, 25% is one fourth,
33.33% is one third, 16.66%

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.250
is 1 6, 12 0.5% is one eight.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.169
Also understand how to gracefully
break down complex percentages.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:31.020
Like 75% of X is simply three fourth of
x, 60% of X is three fifth of X benefit.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.430
This transforms those clunky
percentage multiplication into much

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.510
simpler fraction multiplications,
which are often lightning fast.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.080
Three digital sum method
for simplification.

00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:48.195
Shortcut, calculate the digital sum
sum of digits until a single digit

00:19:48.195 --> 00:19:52.275
is obtained of the question and
then do the same for each option.

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:55.545
The digital sum of the correct
answer should match the

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.540
digital sum of the question.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.840
Benefit.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.410
This can quickly eliminate
options, especially when the

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.060
calculations are complex.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.580
But a word of caution, my friend, it's
not always reliable If multiple options

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.260
end up with the same digital sum, or
if the question involves approximation,

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.420
use it as a quick double check.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.475
A useful hint, not your
only source of truth.

00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:24.465
Four unit digit method for simplification,
shortcut for operations like

00:20:24.465 --> 00:20:27.195
multiplication, addition, or subtraction.

00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:30.075
Just look at the unit digits
of the numbers involved.

00:20:30.435 --> 00:20:34.155
The unit digit of your final
result must match the unit digit

00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:35.985
of the correct option benefit.

00:20:36.285 --> 00:20:41.325
This is incredibly fast for eliminating
options if they have distinct unit digits.

00:20:41.565 --> 00:20:46.365
However, a small disclaimer, it doesn't
work for division or approximation.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.360
And if multiple options share the same
unit digit, well then it's not much help.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.430
Five approximation.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.200
Smart rounding shortcut.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.030
When you're approximating always,
always peek at the options first.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.255
If the options are widely spaced, you can
be quite aggressive with your rounding.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:11.250
For example, 4 97 0.89 can be rounded
to a nice round 500, but if the

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.940
options are cuddling close to each
other, then my friend, you need to

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:22.350
round more carefully, perhaps 4 97
0.89 to 4 98, or even 4 97 benefit.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.085
This prevents you from doing
unnecessary precise calculations

00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:29.610
when a rough, intelligent
estimate is perfectly sufficient.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.645
Work smart, not just hard.

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:35.115
Six, break down complex calculations.

00:21:35.445 --> 00:21:36.045
Shortcut.

00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:40.605
Instead of trying to multiply 45
by 12 in one go, break it down.

00:21:40.935 --> 00:21:48.045
Think 45 multiplied by 10, which is four
50 plus 45 multiplied by two, which is 90.

00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:51.945
Add them up four 50
plus 90 equals five 40.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.750
Or for 12 into 15, think 12
into 10 plus 12 into five.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.889
That is one 20 plus 60,
which is 180 benefit.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.420
This makes large calculations far
more manageable and significantly

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.830
reduces your mental load.

00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:11.504
It's like chopping a big pizza
into smaller eatable slices.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.260
Seven, use algebraic identities
for squares or cubes.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.190
Shortcut.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.050
Don't forget your old friends.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:24.030
The algebraic identities apply beauties
like A plus B. Hold square equals

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.370
a square plus two AB plus B square,
or A minus B hold square equals a

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.530
square minus two, AB B plus B square.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.710
For squaring numbers that are
conveniently near a round figure, for

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:42.399
example, 52 square, think 50 plus two
square, that's 2,500 plus 200 plus

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:46.480
four, which is 2,704, boom benefit.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.010
This is often much faster than direct
multiplication for specific numbers.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.149
Eight reciprocal method for division
shortcut instead of laboriously

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:59.629
dividing by a fraction, simply
multiply by its reciprocal.

00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:05.240
For example, dividing by 0.25 is
exactly the same as multiplying by four.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.340
So much easier benefit.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.820
This dramatically simplifies
division operations, making

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.230
them less time consuming.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.760
Nine practice with mock tests
and timed practice shortcut.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.770
There's no magic pill my friend.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.930
Consistent practice, especially under
timed conditions, is the ultimate secret.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.460
This helps you internalize all these
tricks and significantly boost your

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.159
overall speed and accuracy benefit.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.815
It builds your confidence, reduces
exam anxiety, and makes you a pro.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.770
By diligently applying these shortcuts
and techniques, you can truly supercharge

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.240
your performance in simplification and
approximation questions, transforming them

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.700
into golden opportunities for high scores.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.630
Go get them common mistakes
and misconceptions.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.580
All right, my friends.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.870
Let's talk about the pitfalls, the
classic blunders that can cost you

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.740
precious marks in simplification
and approximation questions.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.020
Being aware of these common mistakes and
misconceptions is half the battle won.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:08.850
Mistake one.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.260
Incorrect order of operations,
Bo MAs or Pemdas violation.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.929
Example, if you see 10 plus five into
two equals two, and you incorrectly

00:24:18.929 --> 00:24:24.780
solve it as 10 plus five equals to
15, then 15 into two equals to 30,

00:24:24.899 --> 00:24:27.450
you've hit a roadblock explanation.

00:24:27.629 --> 00:24:31.830
Remember, our rule multiplication
must be performed before addition.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:37.710
The correct order is five into two equals
to 10, then 10 plus 10 equals to 20.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.270
It's not a suggestion.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.950
It's the mathematical law.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.830
Correction, always, always
strictly follow bodmas or pemdas.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.550
If in doubt, just scribble down
the order of operations somewhere

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.350
to keep yourself on track.

00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:55.034
Mistake two errors with signs positive.

00:24:55.095 --> 00:25:00.044
On negative example, you might
incorrectly calculate minus five into

00:25:00.044 --> 00:25:03.165
minus three as minus 15 explanation.

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:06.825
When you multiply two negative
numbers, the result magically

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:08.415
becomes a positive number.

00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:13.245
Similarly, a negative number divided
by a negative number is also positive.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.200
Correction.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.660
Remember the golden rules, same signs.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.430
Give positive different signs, give
negative, simple, yet easily forgotten.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.330
Under pressure.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:23.970
Mistake three.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.920
Incorrect handling of bracket.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.660
Example, if you see 20 minus five
minus three equals two, and you

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.270
incorrectly solve it as 20 minus five
minus three equals to 12 explanation.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.090
Ah, the sneaky minus outside a bracket.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.440
When a minus sign precedes a bracket,
the signs of all terms inside the

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.330
bracket change when you remove it.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.620
Correction the correct way, 20
minus five minus three equals

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.230
to 20 minus two equals to 18.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:57.300
Or if you are opening the bracket, 20
minus five plus three equals to 18.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.070
Watch those signs carefully.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.080
Mistake four misinterpreting
of in expressions example,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.260
50% of 200 plus 10 equals two.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.850
Sometimes office treated as simple
multiplication without considering

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.890
its priority explanation.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.060
The word of in mathematical
expressions implies multiplication.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.740
However, it typically has a
higher priority than regular

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.270
multiplication or division.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.400
In some interpretations of Bo MAs, it's
often grouped with orders or exponent.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:34.310
It means calculate that percentage first,
correction, treat off as multiplication.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:38.085
That should be performed right after
you've handled brackets and powers.

00:26:38.345 --> 00:26:41.565
But definitely before division
and regular multiplication.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:42.960
Mistake.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.380
Five.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.870
Inaccurate rounding in approximation.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:54.000
Example rounding 19.49 to 20 When your
options are super close, like 19, 19.5 20.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.590
Explanation rounding too aggressively
when options are narrowly spaced

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.820
can sadly lead you to the wrong
answer in such a scenario.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.600
Rounding 19.49 to 19
might be more accurate.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.310
Correction always.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.410
Check how spaced out your options are
before you decide on your rounding level.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.970
If they're close, be very precise
with your nearest whole number or even

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.950
round to one or two decimal places.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.360
Don't be too eager.

00:27:22.004 --> 00:27:22.995
Mistake six.

00:27:23.085 --> 00:27:26.865
Confusing simplification with
approximation explanation.

00:27:27.014 --> 00:27:31.095
This is a classic attempting to
approximate when an exact answer

00:27:31.095 --> 00:27:35.655
is explicitly required or trying
to simplify precisely when only

00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:37.425
an approximation is asked for.

00:27:37.705 --> 00:27:42.114
This leads to either incorrect answers
if approximating for simplification

00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:47.034
or worse wasted time if simplifying
for approximation correction.

00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:51.354
Before you even start clearly identify
whether the question demands an

00:27:51.354 --> 00:27:53.844
exact value or an approximate one.

00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:56.185
Read the instructions
carefully, my friend.

00:27:56.865 --> 00:27:57.375
Mistake.

00:27:57.375 --> 00:28:01.605
Seven calculation errors due to
lack of practice explanation,

00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:03.345
simple arithmetic mistakes.

00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:07.005
Addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division often

00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:09.165
happen under pressure correction.

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:13.215
The only antidote is consistent
practice of basic calculations.

00:28:13.395 --> 00:28:18.405
Keep memorizing those tables, squares and
cubes and practice under timed conditions.

00:28:18.555 --> 00:28:21.130
Your brain is a muscle,
it needs a workout.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.590
Mistake eight, not using
percentage to fraction conversions.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:33.930
Example, calculating 16.66% of 600 as
16.66 divided by a hundred into 600, which

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:39.000
is honestly quite cumbersome explanation,
not utilizing the fantastic knowledge

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.600
that 16.66% is approximately one sixth.

00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:46.605
Correction, memorize those common
percentage to fraction equivalence

00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:48.105
to simplify calculations.

00:28:48.284 --> 00:28:52.125
Instead of the long method,
just do one by six into 600.

00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:53.205
See the difference?

00:28:53.445 --> 00:28:57.645
By being mindful of these common errors,
my friends, you can significantly

00:28:57.645 --> 00:29:02.054
improve your accuracy and efficiency
in simplification and approximation.

00:29:02.054 --> 00:29:05.949
Questions WWH Framework Summary.

00:29:06.659 --> 00:29:10.229
Let's quickly summarize
simplification and approximation

00:29:10.379 --> 00:29:12.870
using our favorite WH framework.

00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:15.300
So what are these concepts?

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.860
Simplification is all about
reducing complex expressions down

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.050
to their exact numerical values.

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:26.385
Approximation, on the other hand,
is about finding a value that's

00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:28.635
comfortably close to the exact answer.

00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:30.285
Why are they important?

00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:34.335
Well, they're essential for
quick and accurate calculations,

00:29:34.515 --> 00:29:38.475
which are absolutely crucial for
managing your time effectively in

00:29:38.475 --> 00:29:40.815
competitive exams, and frankly.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.870
In real world financial scenarios,
when do we apply them primarily in the

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:51.030
quantitative aptitude sections of banking
exams, but also in your daily financial

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.310
calculations and handy estimations.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.380
Where do these skills come into play?

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.760
Mostly in numerical ability
tests, of course, but also very

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.660
practically in banking operations,
like estimating interest or

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.580
quickly verifying transactions.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.260
Who needs to master these?

00:30:07.564 --> 00:30:12.754
Aspiring banking professionals, sharp
financial analysts, and truly anyone who

00:30:12.754 --> 00:30:17.524
requires rapid mental arithmetic skills
in their professional or personal life.

00:30:17.824 --> 00:30:19.564
And how do we conquer them?

00:30:19.804 --> 00:30:23.314
Simplification relies heavily
on our trustee bot MAs or

00:30:23.314 --> 00:30:25.504
pemdas rules approximation.

00:30:25.504 --> 00:30:29.735
Meanwhile, leverages smart rounding
off of numbers, and then applying

00:30:29.735 --> 00:30:31.895
bots to those simplified figures.

00:30:32.135 --> 00:30:33.784
It's all about working smart.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.930
Fully worked out examples.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.280
All right, my friends.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.330
Let's solidify our understanding with
some fully worked out examples for

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.520
simplification and approximation.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.080
Watch carefully how we apply bot MAs
and those clever rounding techniques.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.510
Example, one simplification question,
what will come in place of the question

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.280
mark in the following equation?

00:30:55.659 --> 00:31:01.990
15 multiplied by eight plus 20 multiplied
by five minus a hundred divided by four

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:08.919
equals options, a 180 5 B 1 95 C two five.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.165
D 215.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:16.780
Understand the question before moving
to explanation solution, step one.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:21.760
First, we tackle the operations inside
the brackets, keeping bodmas in mind.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.450
15 multiplied by eight gives us 1 20 20
multiplied by five results in hundred.

00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:32.245
And a hundred divided by
four simplifies to 25.

00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:34.855
The equation now looks much friendlier.

00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:39.595
One 20 plus a hundred
minus 25 equals step two.

00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:45.625
Next perform addition from left to right,
one 20 plus a hundred equals two 20.

00:31:45.925 --> 00:31:49.915
The equation is now
two 20 minus 25 equals.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.100
Step three, finally
perform the subtraction.

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:59.730
Two 20 minus 25 gives us 1
95, correct answer B 1 95.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.810
Simple as that.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.159
Example, two simplification
with percentages and powers.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:05.940
Question.

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:09.045
What will come in place of the
question mark in the following

00:32:09.045 --> 00:32:16.425
equation, 60% of two 50 plus 15
square minus under route 6 25 options.

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:23.805
A two 30 B, two 40 C3 50 D two
60 understand the question before

00:32:23.805 --> 00:32:25.815
moving to explanation solution.

00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:30.365
Step one, let's first convert that
percentage and solve that part.

00:32:30.695 --> 00:32:36.485
60% of two 50 is 60 upon a hundred
multiplied by two 50, which gives us

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:40.715
0.60 multiplied by two 50 equals one 50.

00:32:40.865 --> 00:32:41.375
Easy.

00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:42.274
Step two.

00:32:42.514 --> 00:32:48.274
Now let's solve the power square and the
Route 15 square means 15 multiplied by

00:32:48.274 --> 00:32:52.565
15, which is 2 25 and under route 6 25.

00:32:52.715 --> 00:32:53.705
That's 25.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:33:00.450
Since 25 multiplied by 25 equals 6 25,
the equation has transformed into one

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.370
50 plus 2 25 minus 25 equals step three.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.014
Perform addition from left to
right, one 50 plus 2 25 equals 3 75.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.980
Our equation is now 3 75
minus 25 equals step four.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.050
Finally, perform the subtraction.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:27.330
3 75 minus 25 gives us three 50, correct
answer, C3 50 C. Not so scary, right?

00:33:27.635 --> 00:33:32.195
Example three approximation
question, what approximate value

00:33:32.195 --> 00:33:35.375
will come in place of the question
mark in the following equation?

00:33:35.705 --> 00:33:47.945
39.98% of 400.05 plus 25.01% of 1
99 0.99 Options a 210 B, 220 C, two

00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:52.510
30 D two 30 understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:33:53.075 --> 00:33:54.695
Solution, step one.

00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:56.855
The key here is approximation.

00:33:57.005 --> 00:34:01.295
So let's round off these numbers to their
nearest whole numbers or values that

00:34:01.295 --> 00:34:03.335
are super convenient for calculation.

00:34:03.545 --> 00:34:06.935
39.98% becomes a neat 40%.

00:34:07.235 --> 00:34:15.545
400.05 becomes a round 425.01%
becomes a perfect 25% and 1

00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:17.980
99 0.99 happily rounds to 200.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:26.240
The approximate equation now reads 40%
of 400 plus 25% of 200 equals step two.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.480
Now let's calculate these
simplified percentages.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:34.250
40% of 400 is 40 upon a
hundred multiplied by 400.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.360
Which equals 0.40 multiplied
by 400, giving us one 60.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:46.500
25% of 200 is 25 upon a hundred
multiplied by 200, which equals 0.25,

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.080
multiplied by 200, giving us 50.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.965
The equation has become one 60 plus 50
equals step three, perform the audition.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.490
One 60 plus 50 totals up to 210.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:59.450
Step four.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.190
Compare this with the options.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.350
Our approximate value is
210, correct answer 8 210.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.550
Perfectly close.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.390
Thank you.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.100
See you in the next lecture.
