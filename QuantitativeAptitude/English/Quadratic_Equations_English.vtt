00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on quadratic equations.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.180
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.240
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:14.160
All right.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.860
Listen up my friend quadratic equations.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.960
They're not some rocket science, okay?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.570
They're a fundamental part of algebra.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.909
The very backbone you can say, simply
put a quadratic equation is just a

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.159
polynomial equation of the second degree.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.450
What does that mean?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.300
It means the highest
power of your variable.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.910
Usually X is a grand two.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.800
It's always written in this standard form,
JAX square plus B, X plus C equals zero.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.280
Here A, B, and C are real numbers.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.394
Or egg bath.

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.335
A can never be zero Y Kki.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.655
Agar is zero hogan.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:57.964
So this brave quadratic equation will
suddenly become a simple linear equation

00:00:58.114 --> 00:01:00.455
like a superhero losing their powers.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:04.325
You see, the main goal when we
are solving a quadratic equation

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:08.495
is to find those special values
of X that satisfy the equation.

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:13.205
These are also famously known as the
roots or solutions of the equation.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:15.780
And remember, these roots can be real.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.910
The ones you can actually see on a
number line or even complex living

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.980
in their own mathematical dimension.

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:25.274
Real world relevance.

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:30.464
Now, why is this important for a sharp
financial professional like yourself?

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:35.804
Understanding quadratic equations actually
helps officers of future financial

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.414
wizards in various financial calculations.

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:43.335
Imagine determining tricky loan
interest rates or analyzing complex

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.774
investment growth scenarios.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:49.664
In these real world situations, variables
often have squared relationships.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.260
This knowledge, my friends, is
absolutely crucial for quick and accurate

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.880
decision making, especially when you're
tackling quantitative analysis tasks.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.065
Think of it as your secret weapon.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.270
Breakdown of question types
based on your past exam patterns.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.900
Here are the reoccurring question
formats for quadratic equations.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.010
Pay attention.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.270
This is important.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.910
First up, we have comparing roots, which
makes up a whopping 50% of the questions.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.900
Here you'll be given two
quadratic equations and your task

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.555
is to find the roots of both.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.490
Then like a detective, you establish
a relationship between the variables.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.580
Is it X greater than Y, maybe X, less
than or equal to Y, or X equal to Y?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.250
Sometimes there's no relation at all.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.075
Just like some friendships, Hena.

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:44.175
Next, about 25% of the time,
you'll see questions on finding

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:45.465
roots of a single equation.

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:46.155
Simple.

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:50.205
You get one quadratic equation and
you just need to find its roots.

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.865
Then comes the tricky part for
some word problems leading to

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:56.355
quadratic equations, about 15%.

00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:01.335
These are the ones based on age, time,
and work speed and distance, et cetera.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.010
You read the problem, scratch
your head, and then translate

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.690
it into a quadratic equation.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.810
It's like turning a story
into a mathematical riddle.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.710
A smaller chunk, 5% deals
with the nature of roots.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.340
These questions ask about the
discriminant, which is like the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.940
fortune tell for roots to determine
if they are real equal or imaginary.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.795
And finally, another 5% are
missing coefficient problems.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:31.815
Here, one of the coefficients that's
A, B, or C is missing or unknown

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.445
and you need to find it given
some information about the roots.

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:40.905
It's like finding a missing piece
of a puzzle, formulas and tricks.

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:42.615
Time for some cheat codes.

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:47.355
My friends, these standard form
as we discussed is ax square

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:50.025
plus BX plus C equals zero.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:56.265
The Evergreen Quadratic formula, also
known as Sharia's Formula is your

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.365
best friend when nothing else works.

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:06.495
X equals two minus B plus minus square
Rudolph B square minus four AC upon two a.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.895
Learn this like your own name.

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:13.485
Then we have the discriminant,
which we often write as delta.

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:19.995
Yeah, just D. It's calculated as D
equals to B square minus four ac.

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:24.615
This little guy tells you a
lot if D. Greater than zero.

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:26.775
Roots are real and distinct.

00:04:27.195 --> 00:04:33.855
Matlab two different real answers if D
equals zero roots are real and equal.

00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:35.265
Mut lab, same.

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:36.465
Real answer twice.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.320
If D, less than zero roots are imaginary.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.600
Matlab, no real solutions.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.370
They live in complex world.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.950
For your basic root operations, remember
the sum of roots alpha plus beta is

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.330
simply minus B by A, and the product of
roots alpha beta is C by a super helpful.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.770
Now, a smart trick for comparing
roots using the coefficient method.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.830
If A is positive in both equations,
just look at the signs of B and c to

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.840
quickly deduce the signs of the roots.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.990
If you see a X square minus BX
plus C, both roots are positive wa.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.690
If you see a X square plus BX
plus C, both roots are negative.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.810
Torah.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.700
If you see ax square plus BX minus C one
positive, one negative, and guess what?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.250
The positive route is usually larger.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.450
If you see ax square minus BX minus C,
again, one positive, one negative, and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.340
the positive route is larger Here too.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.170
Keep this trick in your pocket.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.780
Methods of solving.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.970
How do we actually crack these equations?

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.990
You ask.

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:53.895
First, the factorization method, also
known as splitting the middle term.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:58.905
This is like finding two secret
agents whose product is AC and whose

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:04.065
sum is B. Then you split the middle
term BX into two terms using these

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:06.705
numbers and factor by grouping simple.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.480
Next, the completing the square method.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.730
This one is a bit like magic.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.090
You transform the quadratic
equation into the form.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.170
X plus K.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.490
Whole square equals to D. By
manipulating the equation to create

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.420
a perfect square trinomial on
one side, it makes things neat.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.260
Then the most reliable one, using the
quadratic formula directly substitute the

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.900
values of A, B, and C into the quadratic
formula, and voila, you get your roots.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.430
This method is like your loyal friend
works for all quadratic equations.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.450
No excuses.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.919
And finally, the graphical method plot the
quadratic function Y equals to ax square

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.530
plus B, X plus C. The X intercepts of
this parabola, where it crosses the x axis

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.869
represent the real roots of the equation.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.919
Visual, isn't it?

00:06:57.795 --> 00:06:59.835
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:02.534
Want to save time in the exam my friend?

00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:09.495
Try sign analysis for root comparison
for equations ax square plus BX

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:15.675
plus C equal to zero and PY square
plus QY plus R equal to zero.

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:20.835
Quickly determine the signs of the roots
for both equations based on the signs of

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:24.310
B and c. This narrows down possibilities.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.380
Like anything, practice mental
calculation for simple factorization

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.960
for equations with small coefficients.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.520
Don't write down everything.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.350
Practice finding factors.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.060
Mentally speed is key.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.350
Remember, use the cross
multiplication method for comparison.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.070
When comparing roots,
sometimes it's faster to cross.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.270
Multiply the terms after finding
factors rather than explicitly

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.340
calculating decimal values of roots.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.770
Work smart, not just hard,
and for non-perfect squares

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.750
approximation is your friend.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.370
If the discriminant is not a perfect
square, approximate the square root.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.050
To quickly compare roots, especially
in comparison questions, precise

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.030
values are not always needed.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.070
Just a good estimate will do.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.030
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.650
All right, listen up.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.000
Here are the common pitfalls, the
traps where friends often stumble.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.530
Don't be that friend.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.380
Incorrect sign handling or the dreaded
minus sign errors often occur when

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.865
dealing with negative signs in the
quadratic formula or during factorization.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.260
Always, always double check your
signs, like a careful accountant.

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:41.715
Ignoring A in factorization when
splitting the middle term, many forget.

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:46.815
Remember, the product should be
ac, not just C. Don't ignore the A

00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:49.485
calculation errors with discriminant.

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:54.135
Simple arithmetic mistakes in
calculating B square minus four AC

00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:58.755
can lead to completely incorrect roots
or even the wrong nature of roots.

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.960
Slow and steady wins the race here.

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:03.625
Confusing roots with factors.

00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:08.755
If X minus K is a factor,
then X equal to K is a root.

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:15.115
Don't confuse the sign it's X minus K
equal to zero, not x plus K equal to zero.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:20.395
Assuming roots are always real forgetting
to check, the discriminant can lead

00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:22.074
to attempts to find real roots.

00:09:22.074 --> 00:09:26.395
For equations that only have
imaginary roots, sometimes there's

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:28.285
no real solution and that's okay.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.510
Incorrect comparison of roots when
comparing roots of two equations

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.340
ensure you compare both roots of one
equation with both roots of the other.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.440
Don't just compare one with one.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.280
Full comparison, my Friend
W Edge Framework summary.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.290
Let's quickly summarize what we've learned
using our powerful W Edge framework.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.970
So what is it?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.650
It's an algebraic equation of
degree two, simply ax square

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.050
plus BX plus C equal to zero.

00:09:58.435 --> 00:09:59.425
Why do we need it?

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:04.435
It helps us solve problems involving
parabolic parts, area optimization,

00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:06.745
and yes, even financial modeling.

00:10:07.045 --> 00:10:08.035
Very practical.

00:10:08.485 --> 00:10:09.565
When do we apply it?

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:13.585
We apply it when relationships
between variables are non-linear

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:15.325
and involve a square term.

00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:18.200
When things get curved,
you need quadratics.

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:19.585
Where is it used?

00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:20.440
Oh, everywhere.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.069
In physics for projectile
motion in engineering, for

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:27.969
structural design, in finance for
compound interest calculations.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.229
Who uses it?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.699
Engineers, physicists, economists,
statisticians, and anyone?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.319
I mean, anyone solving quantitative
problems, including you, my friend.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.939
And how is it solved?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.530
We solve it using factorization,
the trustee quadratic formula, or

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.370
completing the square to find the
values of that unknown variable.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.720
Simple, isn't it?

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.880
Fully worked out examples.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.130
Let's put theory into practice.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.405
My friends.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.104
Example one question.

00:10:57.435 --> 00:11:00.615
Find the values of X that
satisfy the equation.

00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:05.775
X square minus seven x plus
12 equals to zero options.

00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:12.285
A three comma four, B minus three,
comma four C3 comma minus four,

00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:14.685
D minus three, comma minus four.

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:18.045
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:21.305
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:24.155
Step one, identify coefficients.

00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:29.915
The given equation is x square minus
seven x plus 12 equals to zero.

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:35.585
Here A equals to one B equals to
minus seven and C equals to 12.

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:36.275
Simple.

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:40.905
Step two, use the factorization
method, splitting the middle term.

00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:47.025
We need two numbers that multiply to A
into C. That is one into 12 equals to

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:50.295
12, and add up to B. That is minus seven.

00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:50.895
Hmm.

00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:51.945
What could they be?

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:57.135
These numbers are minus three and
minus four since minus three into

00:11:57.135 --> 00:12:00.225
minus four equals 12 and minus three.

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:02.655
Plus minus four equals minus seven.

00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:09.255
Step three, rewrite the equation, split
the middle term minus seven x. Using the

00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:15.135
numbers we found x square minus three
x minus four x plus 12 equals to zero.

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:20.295
Step four, factor by grouping group the
terms and factor out common factors.

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:25.485
X into X minus three minus four
into x minus three equals to zero.

00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:26.850
See, it's coming together.

00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:30.155
Step five factored out
the common binomial.

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:35.225
You'll notice X minus three is
common, so x minus three into

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:37.355
X minus four equals to zero.

00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:42.454
Step six, set each factor to zero
and solve for x. X minus three

00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:47.074
equals to zero, which gives x equals
to three x minus four equals to

00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:49.505
zero, which gives X equals to four.

00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:53.105
Make them clear, correct
answer A three comma four.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.145
Example two question.

00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:14.165
Options a X greater than YBX, less
than YCX, greater than equal to YDX,

00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:18.515
less than equal to y. Understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:21.605
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:28.390
Step one, solve equation I two x square
minus 13 x plus 21 equals to zero.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.479
For this equation, A equals to two
B equals to minus 13 C equals to 21.

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:38.979
Product A to C equals to
two into 21 equals 42.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.530
Sum B equals to minus 13.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:46.165
We need two numbers that multiply
to 42 and some to minus 13.

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:52.555
These numbers are minus six and minus
seven, so two x square minus six x minus

00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:58.525
seven x plus 21 equals to zero factor
out two x into x minus three minus seven

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.775
in two x minus three equals to zero.

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:05.425
This gives us two x minus seven in
two x minus three equals to zero.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.819
Setting each to zero two x minus
seven equals to zero, which means

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.310
two x equals seven, so x equals to
3.5 x minus three equals to zero,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.230
which means x equals to three.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.960
So the roots for XR three and
3.5 done with x. Step two, solve

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.430
Equation two Y square minus
six Y plus nine equals to zero.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.920
For this equation, A equals to one B
equals to minus six C equals to nine.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.000
Product A and to C equals to
one into nine equals nine.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.400
Sum B equals to minus six.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.620
We need two numbers that multiply
to nine and some to minus six.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.650
These numbers are minus
three and minus three.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.130
Yes.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.910
Same number.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.070
So Y square minus three, Y minus
three y plus nine equals to zero.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.380
Factor out Y into Y minus three.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.690
Minus three into Y minus
three equals to zero.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.850
This becomes Y minus three, two y minus
three equals to zero setting to zero.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.780
Y minus three equals to zero,
which means Y equals to three.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.060
So the root for Y is three.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.910
A repeated root mud
club Y is always three.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.910
Step three, compare the roots.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.890
Now the main event, compare each
root of X with the root of Y. When X

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.990
equals to three, Y equals to three.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.940
Mutt love x equals to Y when X
equals to 3.5 y equals to three.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.170
Mutt love X greater than y. Step
four, establish the relationship.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.770
Since X can be equal to Y or greater than
Y, the overall relationship, my friend, is

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.710
X, greater than equal to YC, not so tough.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.930
Correct answer, CX, greater than
equal to y. Example three question.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.040
The sum of the squares of two
consecutive odd numbers is two 90.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.180
Find the numbers.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.010
Options.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:58.150
A nine 11 B 1113 C, 1315
D seven, comma nine.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.230
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, step-by-step

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.270
solution with detailed explanation.

00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:06.579
Step one, define the variables.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.839
Let's make it simple.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.819
Let the first odd number be x. Since the
numbers are consecutive odd numbers, the

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:15.280
very next odd number will be x plus two.

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:15.910
Matlab.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.939
If X is five, the next
odd is seven, right?

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:22.839
Step two, formulate the equation
based on the given information.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.709
The problem states that the sum of
the squares of these two consecutive

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:32.260
odd numbers is two 90, so we write
it as x square plus x plus two

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.329
whole square equals to two 90.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.130
This is where the magic happens.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.000
Step three.

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:39.155
Expand and simplify the equation.

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:43.865
X square plus x square plus four
x plus four equals to two 90.

00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:48.185
Remember a plus B whole square
combined terms, two x square plus

00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:50.555
four x plus four equals to two 90.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:53.855
Subtract two 90 from both sides
to bring it to the standard

00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:55.415
quadratic form, like aligning the.

00:16:55.645 --> 00:17:00.115
Does two x square plus four
x minus 2 86 equals to zero.

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:05.155
This simplifies to two x square plus
four x minus 2 86 equals to zero.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.365
Step five, divide by the
common factor, if any.

00:17:08.514 --> 00:17:10.704
Look, the whole equation
can be divided by two.

00:17:11.285 --> 00:17:16.325
Let's do it to make our lives easier,
divide the entire equation by two x square

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:19.235
plus two x minus 1 43 equals to zero.

00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:21.245
A much friendlier equation, isn't it?

00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:23.915
Step five, solve the quadratic equation.

00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:28.775
Using factorization, we need two
numbers that multiply to minus 1 43.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.050
And sum to two, think a little.

00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:37.080
These numbers are 13 and minus 11
because 13 into minus 11 equals 1

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.409
43 and 13 plus minus 11 equals two.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:47.310
So x square plus 13 x minus 11 x minus
1 43 equals to zero factor by grouping.

00:17:47.485 --> 00:17:52.405
X into x plus 13 minus 11
into x plus 13 equals to zero.

00:17:52.525 --> 00:17:56.905
This gives us X plus 13 into
X minus 11 equals to zero.

00:17:56.965 --> 00:18:02.455
Step six, find the possible values of
x. X plus 13 equals to zero, which means

00:18:02.485 --> 00:18:08.155
x equals to minus 13, x minus 11 equals
to zero, which means x equals to 11.

00:18:08.335 --> 00:18:12.115
Step seven, determine the numbers
since we are looking for positive,

00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:15.355
odd numbers typically implied in
such questions unless specified.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.400
If X equals to 11, the
first odd number is 11.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.370
The next consecutive odd
number is x plus two.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.740
That is 11 plus two equals 13.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.240
If X was minus 13, the numbers
would be minus 13 and minus 11.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.680
Who squares also summed it two 90, but to,
we usually go with positive options first.

00:18:34.115 --> 00:18:36.064
Step eight, verify the answer.

00:18:36.185 --> 00:18:37.205
Let's check our work.

00:18:37.355 --> 00:18:42.845
11 square plus 13 square equals to
1 21 plus 1 69 equals to two 90.

00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:45.155
This matches the given
condition perfectly.

00:18:45.185 --> 00:18:48.675
Our answer is correct,
correct answer, B, 11, 13.

00:18:48.725 --> 00:18:49.294
Thank you.

00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:50.855
