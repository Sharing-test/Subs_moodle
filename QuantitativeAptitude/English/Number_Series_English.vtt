00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on number series.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.180
You don't need to be a genius.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.860
Just stay till the end.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.785
You will be an expert in this
concept, concept, explanation.

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:18.705
Number series, my Friend, is a fascinating
sequence of numbers that strictly

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.314
follows a certain hidden pattern or rule.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:26.354
Your primary goal is to identify
this pattern and then use your sharp

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:30.765
mind to find the missing number or
the very next number in the series.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:35.515
These patterns can involve basic
arithmetic operations, like simple

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:42.655
addition plus need subtraction, minus keen
multiplication, star, and precise division

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:48.595
slash, or even more complex operations,
like perfect squares, true cubes, prime

00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:51.235
numbers, or clever combinations of these.

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:55.765
It's truly like solving a fascinating
puzzle where you need to figure

00:00:55.765 --> 00:01:00.175
out the exact hidden logic behind
the elegant arrangement of numbers.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.470
Real world relevance as an officer.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.730
Understanding number series helps
develop keen logical reasoning for

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.890
analyzing financial data trends.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.480
It specifically builds quick pattern
recognition skills essential for

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.430
identifying anomalies or accurately
forecasting in crucial banking operations.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.220
This is truly a power up for your
career breakdown of question types.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.520
Based on past patterns
in your exam, my friend.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.780
Here are the reoccurring question
formats you must master to ace it.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.930
First, we have missing number series
making up about 40% of the questions here.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.170
A sequence has one number
missing and you need to find it.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.430
Next is wrong number series,
roughly 30% of the time.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.560
This is where one number doesn't quite
fit the pattern and you must identify the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.170
incorrect one, like a detective on a case.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.710
Then comes mixed operation series, about
15% involving a delightful combination

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.690
of different arithmetic operations.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.670
Alternating series accounts for 8%,
where two different series cleverly

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.560
alternate within the main sequence.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.860
Finally, prime composite square cube
based series around 7% are based on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.330
special properties of numbers like
prime composite perfect squares or

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.960
beautiful cubes, formulas plus tricks.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000
Now for the mantras and useful
tricks, my friend for different series

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.990
always look for constant differences,
increasing decreasing differences

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.520
or differences that gracefully form
another series for ratio series.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
Check for constant ratios
between consecutive terms.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.190
Square Cube series.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.850
Just easily recognize perfect
squares or cubes of natural

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.590
numbers or their variations.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.190
Prime number series means
clearly identifying patterns

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.600
involving prime numbers.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.519
For alternating series, you absolutely
must check for two independent patterns

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.490
running alternately and mixed operations.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.560
Be thoroughly prepared for combinations
of addition plus subtraction, minus

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.600
multiplication, star, and division
slash it's like a masala mix.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.875
Methods of solving.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:18.345
So how do we actually solve
these puzzles step by step?

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:21.225
The step difference method
is your ultimate key.

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.045
Calculate differences
between consecutive terms.

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:29.145
If no pattern immediately emerges,
calculate second differences, and so on.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:31.635
Sometimes the pattern hides quite deep.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.940
The ratio method involves dividing
each term by its preceding term

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.750
to find a constant ratio or a
consistent pattern in ratios.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.340
Observation method lets you directly
spot if the series uses squares,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.025
cubes, prime numbers, or other common
mathematical sequences just by a glance.

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:53.674
For alternating pattern identification,
literally separate the series

00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:57.515
into two independent subseries
and analyze each separately.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.625
Mixed operations analysis means
carefully testing combinations of

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:07.590
operations, like multiply by X and then
add slash subtract y. Lastly, reverse

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.829
engineering if options are provided.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.070
Working backward can sometimes
quickly confirm the pattern.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.390
It's a smart move.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.399
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.870
Now for quick shortcuts and smart
techniques, my friend, to save precious

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.020
exam time, look for big jumps or drops.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.930
Large changes usually mean multiplication,
star division, squares or cubes.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.840
Small changes on the other hand, strongly
indicate addition plus subtraction, minus

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.370
always check prime numbers as a possible
pattern, especially for increasing

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.605
series with rather irregular differences.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.830
If numbers are near perfect, squares or
cubes, instantly consider patterns like

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.040
n squared plus or minus K or N cubed plus
or minus K for multiplication series.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.520
Try factorization to find the
multiplying factor quickly.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.440
Work with differences first.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.520
It's often the quickest and most
effective first step to reveal a pattern.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.680
Finally, eliminate options.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.430
Use partial deductions to cleverly
rule out unlikely answers.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.885
This is pure jagar.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.090
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.555
Let's talk about common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:22.425
My friends that often trip up,
even the brightest minds first,

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:24.165
overlooking simple patterns.

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:28.485
Sometimes the pattern is incredibly
basic, but we tend to overthink it.

00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.344
Looking for complex formulas.

00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:32.805
Second fixating on one pattern.

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:34.875
Don't get stuck like a broken record.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.590
Be flexible and eagerly
try other approaches.

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:39.875
Third calculation errors.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:44.345
Basic arithmetic mistakes can severely
ruin your pattern identification.

00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:46.955
Fourth, ignoring alternating series.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.985
This means missing two
cleverly interleaf patterns.

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.265
Fifth, not checking all terms.

00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:55.685
Never, ever identify a
pattern on just a few terms.

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:58.690
Always thoroughly verify it
across the entire series.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:02.835
Finally confusing square cube
series with multiplication.

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:08.354
Remember, 4, 9 16 is a square
series, two squared, three squared,

00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:12.135
four squared, not necessarily a
simple multiplication sequence.

00:06:12.284 --> 00:06:13.664
Don't fall into this trap.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.169
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.530
Let's quickly summarize with
a Handy W Edge framework.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.969
So what is it?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.510
It's simply a sequence of numbers
following a specific rule.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.859
Why is it crucial for developing
logical reasoning and sharp pattern

00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:30.870
recognition in your competitive exams?

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.219
When is it applied primarily in
the quantitative aptitude sections

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.900
of various competitive exams?

00:06:37.275 --> 00:06:39.255
Where is it used in banking?

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:43.305
Finance for trend analysis and
various problem solving scenarios?

00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:44.385
Who needs it?

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:49.425
Friends, competitive exam, aspirants,
bankers, analysts, and anyone needing

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.765
to accurately interpret numerical data.

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:54.015
And finally, how do you solve it?

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:59.055
By precisely identifying the underlying
mathematical operation or clear logic

00:06:59.055 --> 00:07:02.385
between terms fully worked out examples.

00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:05.235
Time for some real, AKA my friends.

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:09.225
Let's see these concepts in practice
with a few fully worked out examples.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:14.385
Example, one missing number,
series, edition pattern question.

00:07:14.505 --> 00:07:16.395
Find the missing number in the series.

00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:20.325
5 12, 19 26, question mark.

00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:21.975
40 options.

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:27.735
A 31 B 33 C 35, D 37.

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:30.645
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.590
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.910
Step one, analyze the differences
between consecutive terms like a

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.800
sharp auditor difference between 12
and five is 12, minus five is seven.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.060
Difference between 19 and
12 is 19 minus 12 is seven.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.575
Difference between 26 and
19 is 26 minus 19 is seven.

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:55.435
Step two, identify the pattern.

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:58.795
The pattern, my friend, is a
constant addition of seven to

00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:00.595
each term to get the next term.

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:01.735
Simple, isn't it?

00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:05.275
Step three, apply the pattern
to find the missing number.

00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:10.465
To find the missing number, just add
seven to the last known term, which is 26.

00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:13.345
So 26 plus seven is 33.

00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:17.585
Step four, verify the pattern with
the subsequent term, if available.

00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:22.955
If the missing number is 33, then
33 plus seven is 40, which perfectly

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:24.875
matches the next number in the series.

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:28.985
Our logic is spot on, correct answer B 33.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.020
Example two.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.340
Wrong number series, multiplication
and subtraction pattern question.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.620
Identify the wrong number in the series.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:46.980
3, 7 15, 31. 63, 1 20.
Options A seven B 15 C 63.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.090
D one 20 Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:54.975
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:08:55.185 --> 00:08:58.695
Step one, look for a pattern
by testing common operations.

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.425
Let's smartly try
multiplication and addition.

00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:04.545
Subtraction three into
two plus one is seven.

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:06.710
Seven into two, plus one is 15.

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.699
15 into two plus one is 31.

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:12.370
31 into two plus one is 63.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.439
Step two, apply the identified pattern
to the next term following the pattern.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.199
The next term should be
63 into two plus one.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.439
That means 63 into two is 1
26 and 1 26 plus one is 1 27.

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:29.229
Step three, compare with the given series.

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:34.810
The series has one 20, but according to
our consistent pattern, it should be 1 27.

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:36.104
There's a clear gboard here.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.890
Step four, conclude the wrong number.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.730
Therefore, one 20 is indeed
the wrong number in the series.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.670
It's the ultimate misfit correct answer.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.600
D one 20.

00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:53.505
Example three missing number series,
square series variation question.

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:56.145
Find the missing number in the series.

00:09:56.445 --> 00:10:03.255
One comma four comma nine
question mark comma 25 comma

00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:11.230
36 options A 12 B 16 C 18 D 20.

00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:15.105
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.855
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:23.295
Step one, observe the nature
of the numbers very carefully.

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:27.555
Notice that each number in the
series is a perfect square.

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:34.035
One equals one square, four equals
two square nine equals three square.

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:37.755
Step two, identify the sequence of bases.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.550
The basis of the squares are
clearly consecutive natural

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.550
numbers, one comma two, comma three.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.860
This is a straightforward progression.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.660
Step three, determine the missing
base and calculate the missing number

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.090
following this logical sequence.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.070
The next base should be four, so
the missing number is simply four

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.710
square, which confidently equals 16.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.969
Step four, verify the pattern
with subsequent terms.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.260
The next number in the series
is 25, which is five square.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.650
The last number is 36,
which is six square.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.449
This perfectly confirms the pattern,
just like a winning shot in a game.

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:21.060
Correct answer B 16.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.170
Thank you.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.849
See you in the next lecture.
