00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.630
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on partnership.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.680
We are about to make the
complicated, ridiculously clear on

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.900
this concept with this tutorial.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:12.375
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:16.965
All right, so what exactly is
this partnership business in

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.575
quantitative, aptitude, eh, simple.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.634
It's all about two or more individuals.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.435
Our partners here deciding to pull
in their money, their capital,

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:29.475
to kickstart a business venture.

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:35.085
Think of it like a potluck, but
everyone brings cash when profit,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.335
or God forbid, a loss happens.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:38.685
It's shared among them.

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:43.655
How it's based on how much money
each person put in and for how

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.365
long that money stayed in the game.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:51.515
The Golden Rule, the mantra if you will,
is this profit is directly proportional

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:54.035
to the product of capital and Time.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.885
Remember that it's a business philosophy.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.980
Real world relevance.

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.650
Now, why should you even bother with this?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
Understanding partnership concepts
is absolutely vital for those

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.460
aiming for crucial roles in finance.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.670
Imagine you are a big
shot in a bank, right?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.430
You need to analyze business proposals.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.960
Figure out if someone deserves
a loan, or maybe even assess the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.000
financial health of joint ventures.

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.780
This concept helps you brilliantly
understand how profits are sliced

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.399
and diced, and importantly, how
much risk each partner is carrying.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.435
It's like having financial x-ray vision,
quite useful key types of partnerships.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.030
In this exciting world of partnerships,
we primarily deal with a few types,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.220
just like different flavors of chai.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.010
First up, we have simple partnership.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.850
This is when all partners are
investing their hard earned money

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.860
for the exact same duration.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.440
No drama, just straightforward sharing.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.690
Then comes the compound partnership
where things get a bit spicy here.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.430
Investments are made for different
durations, so someone might invest

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.320
for six months, another for a year.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.180
You need to be sharp here.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.380
Next.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.739
We differentiate between
active and sleeping partners.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.600
Yes, even in business, some are buzzing
bees, others are snoozing bears.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.000
An active partner is hands-on.

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.399
A sleeping partner just puts in money.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.200
This distinction impacts how
profits are shared, especially if an

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.390
active partner gets a salary first.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.535
Of course the main event is
profit or loss distribution.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.465
This is where we calculate
everyone's rightful share based

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:40.475
on their capital and time ratios.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.025
No arguments here, just pure math.

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.805
We also tackle withdrawals
and additional investments.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:49.895
Life isn't static,
neither are investments.

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:52.265
People pull out money or add more.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:56.075
We need to know how to adjust
those profit shares accordingly.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.695
Finally partnership with
salary or commission.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:04.735
Sometimes active partners get a fixed
payment, sort of like a thank you bonus

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:06.895
before the main profit distribution.

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.360
We must account for this first,
otherwise things get messy.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.180
Breakdown of question types
based on your exam patterns.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.290
The questions on partnership often
pop up in a few common formats.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.840
It's good to know what
to expect, isn't it?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.750
Roughly 30 to 35% of the time you'll
encounter simple partnership problems.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.800
These other straightforward ones,
calculating profit shares when

00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.750
investments are for the same period.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.100
A warmup, if you will.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.520
Then about 25 to 30% frequency
for compound partnership problems.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.690
These require a bit more
brainpower as investments vary

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.580
in both amount and duration.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.650
Time to put on your thinking cap.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.910
Literally, problems involving
additional or withdrawal of capital

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.970
come in at around 15 to 20% frequency.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.330
These questions are designed
to check if you can track

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.980
changes in investment over time.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.480
Don't let them trick you.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.230
Scenarios with salary or
commission for partners make up

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.510
about 10 to 15% of the questions.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.890
Remember, active partners sometimes
get their fixed amount before

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.450
the general profit distribution.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.680
Keep an eye on that.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.110
And lastly, around five to 10% are
ratio based problems where profit

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.330
or capital ratios are already given.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.969
And you need to find some unknown values.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.820
These are like detective puzzles, solving
for X, Y, or Z formulas and tricks.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.110
Now for the good stuff, the Jugar
and the formulas that will save

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.180
your precious exam, time for
profit ratio in simple partnership.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.600
If our friends a and B invest Capital
one C one and capital two C two for

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.850
the exact same time, their profit
ratio is simply C one is two C two.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.930
Easy peasy.

00:04:55.665 --> 00:05:01.245
When it's a compound partnership and
a invest C one for time, one, T one

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:04.034
and B, invest C two for time two.

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:09.825
Then their profit ratio becomes C one
into T, one is two C two into T two.

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:11.265
This is the big one.

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:17.565
The general formula for any individual's
profit share is individual capital into

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:23.655
time divided by total capital into total
time, all multiplied by the total profit.

00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:29.085
It's like finding your slice of the
pie a neat trick for equal time.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:34.335
If the time duration is constant for all
partners, then the profit is directly

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.255
proportional to the capital invested.

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.145
More money, more profit.

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:39.135
Simple as that.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.130
And the trick for equal capital, if
everyone invests the same amount,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.600
but for different durations, then
profit is directly proportional to the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.150
time period, more time more profit.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.410
Makes sense, right?

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.780
Methods of solving.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.480
How do we actually crack these problems?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.435
We have a few trusty
methods in our arsenal.

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:06.794
The ratio method is your best friend here
express the effective investment, which

00:06:06.794 --> 00:06:09.555
is capital into time for all partners.

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:14.775
As a simple ratio, the profit will then
be distributed in this exact ratio.

00:06:15.164 --> 00:06:17.985
This is the most common
and efficient method.

00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:18.914
It's a shortcut.

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:24.885
The unitary method involves calculating
the profit for one unit of investment

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:31.125
for one unit of time, and then scaling it
up reliable, but sometimes a tad slower.

00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:35.895
Sometimes you'll need to get
algebraic with equation formation.

00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:40.455
This is super useful, especially when
there are unknown capital amounts,

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.555
time periods, or profit shares.

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:46.185
Setting up equations can lead
you directly to the answer.

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:49.755
Finally the LCM method for time.

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:54.525
When you have different time periods,
finding the least common multiple of those

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:59.745
periods can help simplify calculations
and give you a common base for comparison.

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:06.100
It avoids nasty fractions, shortcuts
and smart techniques want to be

00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:07.845
a pro in partnership problems.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.525
Here are some smart techniques.

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:15.135
Always, always simplify ratios
before you jump into calculations.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:18.945
Reduce those capital into time
ratios to that simplest form.

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:22.755
Trust me, it saves you from
wrestling with huge numbers.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:26.055
Focus on the product capital into time.

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:28.424
This is the effective investment.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:32.955
Always remember that this magical
product is what truly determines

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:34.635
a partner's share of the profit.

00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:35.835
It's the key.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.660
For some problems, you might
need to work backwards.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.460
If the final profit share of just
one partner is given, you can often

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.870
use that information to find the
total profit or other unknown values.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.975
It's like solving a riddle in reverse.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.750
If no total profit is given, don't panic.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.970
Assume a convenient total.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.920
For instance, assume a total profit
that is the LCM of the ratio parts.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:07.170
This makes calculations incredibly
smooth and easy, and a quick one

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.730
for multiple choice questions.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.140
Check options.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.210
Sometimes a quick glance at the options
can help you eliminate wrong answers, or

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.280
even directly spot the correct one if it
perfectly fits the ratios or conditions.

00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:21.685
It's a smart move.

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:25.315
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:29.604
All right, let's talk about the
traps, the pitfalls, the silly

00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:31.344
mistakes we sometimes make.

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:32.905
Be careful of these.

00:08:33.414 --> 00:08:35.995
The biggest one, ignoring time factor.

00:08:36.324 --> 00:08:41.159
So many friends just distribute profit
based on capital, completely forgetting

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:43.015
how long the money was invested.

00:08:43.284 --> 00:08:44.305
Big mistake.

00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:47.155
Time is money literally in partnerships.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.600
Then there's incorrect ratio
Calculation errors can creep in

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.560
when multiplying capital and time,
or when simplifying those ratios.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.660
Double check your arithmetic my friend.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.310
Sometimes people get confusing,
active and sleeping partners.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.530
Remember, if an active partner gets a
salary or commission, that money comes

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.660
out before the main profit distribution.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.069
Don't mix them up and watch out
for misinterpreting withdrawals

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.600
or additional investments.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.530
When capital changes midway,
you must adjust the capital

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.850
for the correct duration.

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:23.520
It's not a static
investment for the holier.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.650
And the Evergreen Classic
blunder arithmetic errors.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.150
Simple calculation mistakes can
ruin an otherwise perfect solution.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.980
Always reverify your sums, especially
with large numbers or fractions.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.960
Practice makes perfect my friend.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.180
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.010
Let's quickly sum up this partnership
saga using our W Edge framework.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.260
So what is partnership?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.370
It involves multiple individuals
putting in capital to share

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.500
profits or losses from a business.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.900
Why do we bother?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.910
It's brilliant for pooling resources,
sharing risks, and leveraging diverse

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.380
skills for a business venture.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.850
When is this applied?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.350
Whenever two or more individuals
decide to collaborate financially in

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.450
a business, where does this happen?

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.610
Super common in small businesses join
ventures and various investment groups.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.230
Who are these partners?

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.240
Business owners, investors,
and anyone pooling resources

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.800
for a common financial goal.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.020
And how are profits or losses
distributed based on the golden rule?

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:35.110
The ratio of capital into time invested
by each partner fully worked out.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.975
Examples, time for some
live action, my friend.

00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:42.130
Let's solve some examples to
solidify our understanding.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.770
Example one, question A,
B, and C. Start a business.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.150
A invests rupees, 20,000 for eight months.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.950
B invests rupees, 15,000
for 10 months, and C invests

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.080
rupees, 12,000 for 12 months.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.510
If the total profit at the end of
the year is Rupees 10,200, find the

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:13.590
share of A. A Rupees 3,200 B Rupees
3000 C Rupees, 4,000 D Rupees 3,600.

00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:18.495
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:18.885 --> 00:11:23.565
Step one, calculate the product of
capital and time for each partner.

00:11:23.955 --> 00:11:25.965
This is their effective investment.

00:11:26.115 --> 00:11:30.675
Remember, for a 20,000 into
eight is equal to one lack.

00:11:30.675 --> 00:11:35.505
60,000 for B, 15,000 into
10 is equal to one lag.

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:40.275
50,000 for C, 12,000 into
12 is equal to one lag.

00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:44.605
44,000. Step two, find the
ratio of their investments.

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:50.305
Time to simplify quickly, A is
to, B is to C equal to one lack.

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:52.075
60,000 is to one lack.

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:54.805
50,000 is to one, lack 44,000.

00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:56.995
First divide by a thousand.

00:11:57.385 --> 00:12:01.285
160 is to hundred and 50 is 244.

00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:03.115
Then divide by two.

00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:06.415
80 is to 75 is to 72.

00:12:06.655 --> 00:12:08.095
That's the simplest form.

00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:11.365
Step three, calculate
a share of the profit.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:17.724
Total ratio parts equal to 80
plus 75 plus 72 equal to 2 27.

00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:25.375
A share equal to 80 by 2 27 in
two, 10,200 equal to rupees, 3,600.

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:29.065
So the correct answer is D Rupees 3,600.

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:29.965
Perfect.

00:12:30.324 --> 00:12:36.385
Example two, question B and Q started
a business investing rupees 85,000

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:38.665
and rupees, 15,000 respectively.

00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:42.204
In what ratio would the profit
earned after two years be

00:12:42.204 --> 00:12:44.155
distributed between P and q?

00:12:44.484 --> 00:12:44.755
A?

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:47.785
17 is to three B, three is to 17.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.050
C 17 is to five D, five is to 17.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.460
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.010
Step one, notice something my friend.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.480
The time period is the same
for both p and Q2 years, so the

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.990
profit will be distributed in the
direct ratio of their investments.

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.390
No complicated capital into time here.

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.520
B'S investment is to Q's.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.150
Investment equal to 85,000 is to 15,000.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.609
Step two, simplify the ratio.

00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:20.219
This is where your division
skills come in handy.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:27.329
First divide by 1,085 is to 15,
then divide by five, 17 is to three.

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:30.689
So the correct answer is a 17 is to three.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.010
Simple, isn't it?

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.260
Example three question.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.270
A, B, and C enter into a partnership.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.210
A invests Rupees 10,000
for the whole year.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.830
B invests rupees 12,000 initially
and increases his investment to

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.960
Rupees 15,000 after four months.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.690
C invests rupees 15,000 initially, but
withdraws rupees 3000 after nine months.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.080
If the total profit at the
end of the year is 30,000.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.310
Find bees share.

00:13:57.945 --> 00:14:06.735
A Rupees 10,500 B rupees 10980.39
C rupees, 12,000 D rupees 10,000.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.965
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:14.715
Step one, calculate the
effective investment capital

00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:16.215
and time for each partner.

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:18.315
This is a compound partnership.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.130
So careful calculations are
needed for a, he's easy.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.920
10,000 into 12 months equal to one.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.960
Lack 20,000, straightforward.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.060
For B, he invested 12,000 for four
months, then 15,000 for the remaining

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.790
eight months, 12 minus four, so
12,000 into four plus 15,000 into

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:43.670
eight, equal to 48,000 plus one lack
20,000 equal to one lack, 68,000.

00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:49.574
Lever B For C, he invested 15,000
for nine months, then withdraws 3000.

00:14:49.725 --> 00:14:56.145
So 12,000 for the remaining three months,
12 minus nine, so 15,000 into nine plus

00:14:56.265 --> 00:15:03.194
12,000 into three, equal to one lack,
35,000 plus, 36,000 equal to one, 71,000.

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:04.875
C keeps you on your toes.

00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:08.265
Step two, find the ratio of
their effective investments.

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:10.155
Now, simplify these big numbers.

00:15:10.155 --> 00:15:14.885
A is to B is to C. Equal to one
lack, 20,000 is to one lack.

00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:17.435
68,000 is to one 71,000.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:18.815
Divide by a thousand.

00:15:18.815 --> 00:15:22.625
120 is to 1 68 is to 1 71.

00:15:22.865 --> 00:15:26.885
Divide by three 40 is to 56 is to 57.

00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:27.755
Looks good.

00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:29.225
Doesn't simplify further.

00:15:29.465 --> 00:15:32.225
Step three, calculate
B's share of the profit.

00:15:32.495 --> 00:15:33.785
This is the final step.

00:15:34.115 --> 00:15:37.960
Total ratio parts equal
to 40 plus 56 plus 72.

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:45.405
Equal to 1 53 B's share equal to 56
by 1 53 into 30,000 after calculation.

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:49.635
This comes out to
approximately rupees 10980.39.

00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:54.194
Yes, sometimes profits aren't
perfectly round numbers, so the correct

00:15:54.194 --> 00:15:57.344
answer is B rupees 10,009, 80.39.

00:15:57.555 --> 00:15:58.275
Well done.

00:15:58.604 --> 00:15:59.115
Thank you.

00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:00.824
See you in the next lecture.
