00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on compound interest.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.070
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.340
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.120
Explanation.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.100
Now listen carefully, my friend.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
Compound interest, or as we like
to call it, interest on interest

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.710
is where your money doesn't just
sit there earning simple interest.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.350
Oh no, it gets a bonus.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
It's the interest calculated
on your initial principle

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.390
and on all the accumulated
interest from previous periods.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.190
So whatever interest you earned
last year, this year, even that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
interest starts earning interest
leading to exponential growth.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
It's why your savings grow faster
with CI and why loans can feel like a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.170
heavy burden if you are not careful.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.090
Real world relevance.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:56.055
This interest on interest funder
is absolutely crucial, my friend,

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:58.275
for understanding personal finance.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.505
Think about your savings growing
in a fixed deposit or how your

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.065
loan repayments are structured.

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:09.735
For a professional, it's absolutely
vital in analyzing financial products and

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.285
advising customers on smart investments.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:16.785
If you want to impress someone with
your money wisdom, this is your

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.875
topic breakdown of question types.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.780
Now based on past year exam patterns,
we've noticed some reoccurring

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.760
question formats for compound interest.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
First up, we have the direct
calculation types, about 40% frequency.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.990
These simply ask you to find the
amount, principle, interest rate,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.240
or time using the main formula.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.940
Then comes the difference between CI
and SI problems around 25% frequency.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.595
These questions love to trick you
by making you compare the two.

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:49.815
Next.

00:01:49.904 --> 00:01:54.494
The installment based problems
are about 15% frequent involving

00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:56.145
those tricky loan repayments.

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:58.964
Don't worry, we have a joar for that too.

00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:03.585
We also see half yearly or quarterly
compounding questions about

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:07.755
10% frequency where interest is
calculated more often than annually.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:13.665
And for the remaining 10%, we have varying
rates where the rate changes over periods

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:18.885
and population growth or depreciation
problems, which are just CI concepts

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.885
in disguise, each about 5% frequency.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:27.420
So basically compound interest is
everywhere, formulas and tricks.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:28.785
All right.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:32.204
Time for the bra are key formulas.

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.744
The main one for calculating
the total amount.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:42.105
A with compound interest is A equals
P into one plus R by a hundred.

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:45.795
Race to the par T here,
P is your principle.

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:50.295
R is the rate of interest per
annum, and T is the time in years.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:50.954
Simple.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:51.089
Hena.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.160
To find the compound interest itself,
you just subtract the principle

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.190
from the amount CI equals a minus P,
or you can use the direct formula.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.040
CI equals P into bracket one plus
R by a hundred raised to the party.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.910
T minus one.

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:13.785
Now if interest is compounded
half yearly, remember the rate

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:16.035
gets halved and time gets doubled.

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:22.215
A equals P into one plus R by two
by hundred raised to the part two

00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:27.435
T. And if it's quarterly, the rate
becomes R by four and time becomes

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:35.115
40 A equals P into one plus R by four
by hundred raised to the par 40 C.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:37.515
A small tweak makes a big difference.

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:43.244
For exam specific tricks, especially
for the difference between CI and SI for

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:45.765
two years, the formula is a lifesaver.

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:50.894
CI minus SI equals P into
R by a hundred hole square.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:54.734
For three years, it's a bit
longer, but equally powerful.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:04:01.274
CI minus SI equals P into R by
hundred, hole square into three plus

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:05.984
R by hundred, and for the effective
rate over two years, just remember.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:10.665
R effect equals r plus R
plus R into R by hundred.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.295
This is super handy methods of solving.

00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:16.365
How do we tackle these problems?

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:16.875
You ask?

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:19.034
We have a few cool methods.

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:22.965
The most common is the formula
method, just plug and play.

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:25.455
It's straightforward
for most calculations.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.760
Then there's the tree
method or branching method.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.920
This one is fantastic for visualizing
how interest builds up year by year,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.080
especially when rates are varying.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.570
It's like watching your money tree grow.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.160
We also have the ratio method or
percentage change method, which

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.110
converts rates into fractions.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.980
This is super efficient for
successive percentage increases,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.140
making shorter periods a breeze.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.110
The effective rate method calculates
the true annual rate, simplifying

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.180
things when compounding isn't annual.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.940
And finally, the successive percentage
method treats CI as a chain of percentage

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.520
increases quick for two or three years.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.090
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.850
Now, for the Jugar part, the Smart
Techniques ever heard of the rule of 72.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050
It's a magic trick to estimate
how many years it takes for your

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.640
investment to double just divide
72 by the annual interest rate.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.580
For example, at 8% interest.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.200
It takes 72 by eight equals nine
years to double mind blown right?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.840
For small rates and short periods,
simple interest and compound

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.640
interest are almost like twins.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.630
Very close.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.290
This can help you quickly
eliminate options in MCQs.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.030
If you're given the difference
between CI and SI for two years, use

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.850
a direct formula CI minus SI equals
P in two R by a hundred square.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.165
To find P or R in a Jiffy.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.430
Also remember for successive
years, if the rate is constant, the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.560
ratio of amounts remains constant.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.900
A two by A one equals a three by a
two equals one plus R by a hundred.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.240
And for those tricky installment
problems, use the unitary method working

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.080
backward from the last installment
to calculate the present value.

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.045
EZPZ.

00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:20.865
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:24.495
All right, let's talk about
where my friends often stumble.

00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:28.125
First, confusing compound
interest with simple interest.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:31.365
Remember, CI is interest on interest.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.465
SI is just on principle.

00:06:33.615 --> 00:06:35.715
Don't mix them up like your spices.

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.265
Second, the incorrect time period.

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:43.095
T people use months instead of
years, or forget to adjust T for

00:06:43.095 --> 00:06:44.960
half yearly or quarterly compounding.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.909
T for trouble, sometimes.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.670
Third rate R misinterpretation.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.330
You must convert the annual rate
to the compounding period rate.

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:58.640
If it's half yearly, it's R by
two, not just R. Then calculation

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.719
errors, those sneaky arithmetic
mistakes with powers and decimals.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.770
Please use a calculator for
practice, but in the exam, be sharp.

00:07:07.544 --> 00:07:10.544
And don't forget to adjust
for compounding frequency.

00:07:10.844 --> 00:07:15.495
Applying the annual formula when it's
half yearly or quarterly is a big no-no.

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:19.905
Finally, misapplying formulas
using the amount formula when

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.365
CI is asked or vice versa.

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.525
Read the question carefully, my friend.

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:28.005
It's not a Race W Edge framework summary.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:30.770
Let's quickly summarize
with our W Edge framework.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.480
So what is compound interest?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.910
It's interest calculated on the initial
principle and all accumulated interest.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.530
Why is it important?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.690
Because it's essential for understanding
financial growth and loan dynamics.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.330
When is it applied in investments,
savings, loans, and even economic

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.485
growth models like population increase.

00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:55.020
Where is it used?

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.480
Everywhere in banking, finance, economics,
and your personal financial planning.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.830
Who uses it?

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.890
Investors, borrowers, bankers, financial
analysts, and all of us individuals.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.750
And how is it calculated using
specific formulas that consider

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.910
principle rate, time, and very
importantly, the compounding frequency.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.650
See, simple, yet powerful,
fully worked out examples.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.905
Now, for the best part,
let's solve some examples.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:26.585
Ready?

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:28.105
Pencil and paper please.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:29.425
Example one.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.189
Question, a sum of 10,000 rupees
is invested at 10% per annum

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.350
compound interest for two years.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.679
What is the amount
after two years options?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:49.410
A 12,000 rupees B, 12,100 Rupees
C, 11,000 rupees D 11,500 rupees.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.180
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.905
Step one, understand the
given values my friend.

00:08:57.569 --> 00:09:04.319
Principle P equals 10,000 rupees rate
R 10% per annum time T two years.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.699
Step two, apply our trustee formula
for amount with compound interest.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.850
The formula is A equals P multiplied
by one plus R upon a hundred to the

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.045
power of t. Step three, substitute
the values into the formula.

00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:25.525
So a equals 10,000 multiplied by
one plus 10 upon a hundred square.

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:32.635
This simplifies to a equals 10,000,
multiplied by one plus 0.1 square.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.570
Which means a equals 10,000 multiplied
by 1.1 square, and finally a

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.170
equals 10,000 multiplied by 1.21.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.210
So A equals 12,100 rupees
state the correct answer.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.720
The amount after two years is 12,100 ru.

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:55.650
Correct answer B 12,100 rupees.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.350
Example two question.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.830
The difference between compound interest
and simple interest on a certain sum at

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.150
5% per annum for two years is 15 rupees.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.730
Find the sum options.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.830
A 5,000 rupees.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:23.550
B 6,000 Rupees C 7,500 D 8,000
rupees understand the question

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.315
before moving to explanation.

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:29.790
Solution.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.329
Step one, understand the given values.

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:39.120
My friend, difference between CI
and SI for two years equals 15.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.050
Rupees rate R equals 5% per
annum time D equals two years.

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:50.895
Step two, apply our special
formula for the difference

00:10:50.895 --> 00:10:53.835
between CI and SI for two years.

00:10:54.045 --> 00:11:00.465
Remember that quick trick CI minus
si equals PR by a hundred square.

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:07.185
Step three, substitute the values
into the formula, so 15 equals

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:09.495
B five by a hundred square.

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:19.405
This becomes 15 equals P one by 20
square further, 15 equals P one by 400.

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:28.314
Now solve for PP equals 15 multiplied
by 400 and voila P equals 6,000 rupees.

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:31.314
Step four, state the correct answer.

00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:37.015
The sum is 6,000 rupees
correct answer B 6,000 rupees.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.900
Example three question.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.740
At what rate percent per annum will
2000 rupees amount to 2,420 rupees

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.230
in two years compounded annually?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:12:01.020
Options a 8% B, 9% C, 10% D 11% understand
the question before moving to explanation.

00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:04.964
Solution.

00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:08.235
Step one, understand the given values.

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:12.345
My friend, principle B equals 2000 rupees.

00:12:12.675 --> 00:12:18.944
Amount A equals 2,420 rupees
time T equals two years.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.579
Step two, apply our main formula
for amount with compound interest.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:31.839
The formula is A equals B one plus R by
a hundred to the power T. Step three,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.720
substitute the values into the formula.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.630
So 2,420 equals 2001 plus
R by a hundred square.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:49.830
Divide both sides by 2000, 2,420 by 2000
equals one plus R by a hundred square.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:56.305
This simplifies to 1.21 equals one
plus R by a hundred square step four.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:02.510
Now solve for R. Take the square
root of both sides under Route 1.21

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.610
equals one plus R by a hundred.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:12.170
We know under route 1.21 is 1.1, so
1.1 equals one plus R by a hundred.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.210
Subtract one from both sides.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.780
1.1 minus one equals R by a hundred.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.350
This gives 0.1 equals R by a hundred.

00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:24.045
Finally multiply by a hundred to find.

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:30.314
RR equals 0.1 multiplied by
a hundred, so r equals 10%.

00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.045
Step five, state the correct answer.

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:38.805
The rate percent per annum
is 10% correct answer C, 10%.

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:39.735
Thank you.

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.250
