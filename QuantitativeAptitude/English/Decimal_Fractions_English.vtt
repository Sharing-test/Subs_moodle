00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on decimal fractions.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.540
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.540
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.700
A decimal fraction is a fraction
where the denominator is a power

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.870
of 10, like 1,000, 1000, et cetera.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.060
Instead of writing the denominator,
we use a decimal point.to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.710
represent the fractional part.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.720
The digits to the right of the
decimal part represent parts of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.910
a whole based on powers of 10.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.110
For example, 0.5 represents five by 10.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.480
0.25 represents 25 by a hundred and
0.125 represents 1 25 by thousand.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.640
It's like slicing a cake
into 1,000 or 1000 pieces.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.480
Here are the basic components
and related concepts.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.220
Very important, my friend.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.540
First, the decimal point dot,
which separates the whole number

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.280
part from the fractional part.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390
Then the whole number part, the
digits to the left of the decimal

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.580
point, representing complete units.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.040
And the fractional part, the digits
to the right of the decimal part,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.020
representing parts of a whole.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.640
Each digit in a decimal number
has a specific place value to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.080
the right of the decimal point.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.750
The places are tens, one by 10
hundreds, one by hundred thousands,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.090
one by thousand and so on.

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:35.585
We also have like decimals, which
are decimal fractions, having the

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.505
same number of decimal places.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:41.345
Example 2.34 and 5.67.

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:45.875
And then unlike decimals having a
different number of decimal places,

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:53.315
example 1.2 and 3.456, these can be
converted to like decimals by adding

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.125
zeros at the end of the fractional
part without changing their value.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.745
Example, 1.2.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.210
Equals 1.200.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.770
Smart trick, isn't it?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.810
Real world relevance.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.910
Why are decimals so important?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.480
You ask.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.620
Decimal fractions are fundamental
in banking and finance for

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.460
precise calculations involving
money and interest rates.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.365
They enable accurate handling of
values, less than whole numbers,

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.820
because every Pesa counts.

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:25.955
For instance, in interest rate
calculation, interest rates are

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.845
commonly expressed as decimals.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:32.525
Example, 7.5% as 0.075.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:36.125
Currency exchange rates between
different currencies are

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.315
almost always in decimal form.

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:42.670
Example, one USD equals 83.50 INR.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
For the big boys financial statement,
figures in balance sheets often

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.090
involve values with two or more decimal
places for accurate representation

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.760
of assets, liabilities, and equity.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.640
Think of loan and EMI calculations.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.210
Monthly installments heavily
rely on decimal operations

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.040
for precise payment amount.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:07.575
Even in foreign trade transactions,
prices and values are often

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:09.165
in decimal currency units.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.415
And don't forget share prices.

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:16.755
Stock prices and bond yield are quoted in
decimal values, requiring quick decimal

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:19.304
arithmetic for trading and analysis.

00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:21.704
Decimals are everywhere my friend.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:26.545
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:29.995
Here are other recurring question
formats in decimal fractions

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.675
with estimated frequency.

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:34.885
About 35% are basic operations.

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:39.205
Addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, which are direct.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:45.055
Questions around 25% are conversion
problems, decimal to fraction, fraction

00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:47.035
to decimal, including recording decimals.

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:52.165
For 20%, you'll see simplification
and approximation questions.

00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:56.575
Combining multiple decimal
operations, then 10% are about

00:03:56.575 --> 00:04:00.295
comparison and ordering, asking
to arrange decimal numbers.

00:04:00.475 --> 00:04:04.945
And finally, another 10% are
word problems, application-based

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:09.025
scenarios, needing decimal operations,
practic practice, all of them.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:11.245
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:13.855
No complex formulas here, my friend.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:17.305
Just smart rules for
operations and conversions.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:22.425
To convert fraction to decimal, divide
the numerator by the denominator.

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:28.635
Example three by four equals
three divided by four equals 0.75.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:29.925
Simple division.

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:33.195
That's all to convert decimal to fraction.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.675
Write the given decimal without
the decimal point as the

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.955
numerator for the denominator.

00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:39.885
Write one.

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:44.025
Followed by as many zeros as there
are digits after the decimal point.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.440
Then simplify the fraction.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.440
Example, 0.25 equals 25 by a
hundred equals one by four,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.550
easy, right for converting, pure
recurring decimal to fraction.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.050
If zero point x is the recurring
decimal, then zero point x

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.970
recurring equals X by nine.

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.130
If zero point XY is the recurring
decimal, then zero point XY

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.010
recurring equals XY by 99.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.979
Example, 0.3 recurring equals
three by nine equals one by three.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.060
Magic for converting mixed the
recurring decimal to fraction.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.820
If zero point XY y recurring
it's XY minus X by 90.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:34.125
If zero point XYZZ recurring,
it's x, y, Z minus XY by 900.

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:41.295
Example, 0.166 recurring equals
one six minus one by 90 equals

00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:44.205
15 by 90 equals one by six.

00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:45.615
A bit tricky but doable.

00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:53.515
Now for the fast tricks for multiplication
by powers of 10, 1,000, 1000, move

00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:57.745
the decimal point to the right by the
number of zeros in the power of 10.

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:02.725
Example 3.45 into hundred equals 3 45.

00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.035
It's like the decimal
point is running away.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.060
For Division by Powers of 10, 1,000, 1000,
move the decimal point to the left by

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.130
the number of zeros in the power of 10.

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:19.859
Example 1 23 0.4 by hundred equals 1.234.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.590
Now the decimal point is going backward.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.710
Methods of solving here are step-by-step
methods for solving problems with decimal

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.109
fractions, so you never get stuck.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.270
For addition and subtraction, first,
align the decimal points vertically.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.410
Very important.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.580
Don't miss this step.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.780
Second, add zeros to make the
number of decimal places equal.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.490
Convert to like decimals.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.150
Then perform addition or
subtraction column by column,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.860
just like with whole numbers.

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:54.450
Finally, place the decimal point in
the result directly below the aligned

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.970
decimal points form multiplication.

00:06:57.315 --> 00:07:00.015
Multiply the numbers as if
they were whole numbers.

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:02.025
Ignoring the decimal points initially.

00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:05.835
Count the total number of decimal
places in all the numbers being

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:10.485
multiplied in the product place, the
decimal point from the right, counting

00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:12.405
that total number of decimal places.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.760
And for division, this one has
two cases, case one, dividing

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.410
a decimal by a whole number.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.730
Divide normally place the decimal point
in the quotient when you cross the

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.010
decimal point in the dividend case.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.900
Two, dividing by a decimal.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.860
Convert the device into a whole number by
shifting its decimal point to the right.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.570
Shift the decimal point of the dividend
to the right by the same number of places.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.870
Perform the division as if it
were a whole number division.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.880
Remember, precision is key.

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.025
Four.

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:46.094
Conversion between decimal and fraction.

00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:50.054
Decimal to fraction count
decimal places right number

00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:51.914
as numerator over power of 10.

00:07:52.094 --> 00:07:56.685
Then simplify fraction to decimal,
divide, numerator by denominator

00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.755
using long division practice.

00:07:58.755 --> 00:08:02.174
This my friend shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.174
These tips are for your
exam time constraints.

00:08:05.265 --> 00:08:08.409
So listen carefully, my
friend approximation.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.140
For multiple choice questions
with widely spaced options, use

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.810
approximation instead of exact values.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.539
Round numbers to the nearest whole
number, saves tons of time estimating

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:25.800
decimal places for multiplication
or division before calculating

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.370
quickly estimate the position of
the decimal point in the answer.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.885
Helps verify options or detect errors.

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:37.709
Converting to fractions for complex
operations, sometimes converting

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:41.699
decimals to their fractional form
simplifies complex multiplications

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.890
divisions or recurring decimals.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.469
Example, 0.25 to one
fourth, 0.333 to one third.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.359
This is a secret weapon.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:54.045
Recognizing recurring decimals.

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:57.704
Memorize common fraction to
recurring decimal conversions.

00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:03.915
Example one by three equals
0.31 by six equals 0.16.

00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:05.805
This saves conversion time.

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:08.204
Pairing for simplification.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.214
In simplification problems.

00:09:10.334 --> 00:09:13.275
Look for terms that can be
easily simplified together.

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:16.875
Example, a decimal multiplied
by a multiple of 10.

00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:22.545
Eliminating options for ordering or
comparison Quickly eliminate options

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:26.715
by just comparing the whole number
part or the first few decimal places.

00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:28.725
Work smarter, not harder.

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.695
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:34.755
Let's look at common errors
so you can avoid them.

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:37.725
My friend, misplacing the decimal point.

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:39.165
The most common error.

00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:41.205
Always double check its position.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:45.165
Not aligning decimal points
for addition or subtraction.

00:09:45.405 --> 00:09:50.025
Failing to align them leads to incorrect
place values Align them properly.

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.834
Incorrect Counting of decimal
places in multiplication.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.015
Forgetting to count all
decimal places when placing the

00:09:57.015 --> 00:09:58.485
decimal point in the product.

00:09:58.724 --> 00:09:59.895
Count them carefully.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:05.324
Errors in division by decimal, not
shifting the decimal point in both device

00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:07.844
and dividend by the same number of places.

00:10:08.055 --> 00:10:08.895
Shift both.

00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:18.944
Treating 0.5 and 0.50 differently,
0.5, 0.50 and 0.500 are all equivalent.

00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:23.115
Adding trailing zeros after the decimal
point does not change the value.

00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:27.525
It's the same number just written
differently, confusing, recurring,

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:31.095
and terminating decimals, not
correctly converting recurring

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:32.564
decimals into fractions.

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:36.765
Understand the difference, my
friend, WH framework summary.

00:10:37.064 --> 00:10:38.805
Let's quickly recap my friend.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.140
What numbers using a decimal
point to represent parts of a

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.090
whole based on powers of 10.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.250
Why for precise representation and
calculation of non hole quantities,

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.189
especially in finance when applied in
all calculations involving fractions of

00:10:56.189 --> 00:11:02.520
units, measurements, all currency where in
banking, accounting, engineering, retail

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.765
science, and daily financial transactions.

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:05.910
Who?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.990
Bankers, accountants, scientists,
engineers, shopkeepers,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.670
and anyone handling money.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.980
How Through specific rules for addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.290
and conversion to and from fractions.

00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:22.410
A complete package fully worked out.

00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:17.775
Step two.

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:21.915
Count the total number of decimal
places in the original numbers.

00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:25.275
0.25 has two decimal places.

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:28.065
1.2 has one decimal place.

00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:31.365
0.08 has two decimal places.

00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:36.825
Total decimal places equals two
plus one plus two equals five.

00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:43.995
Step three, place the decimal point in
the product 2,400 by counting five places

00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:46.725
from the right, starting from 2,400.

00:13:46.905 --> 00:13:51.345
Move five places to the left, 0.0240.

00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:55.215
So the result is 0.02.

00:13:55.215 --> 00:13:58.275
Correct answer, a 0.024.

00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:00.225

Step-by-step solution.

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:27.615
Step one, identify the
dividend and the divisor.

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.405
Dividend equals 2.73.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:33.525
DIVISOR equals 0.03.

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:38.235
Step two, convert the DI device
into a whole number by shifting

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:43.275
its decimal point to make 0.03 a
whole number, shift its decimal.

00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:47.390
Point two places to the right,
it becomes three Step three.

00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:51.095
Shift the decimal point of the
dividend by the same number of

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:53.015
places, two places to the right.

00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:56.045
2.73 becomes two seven.

00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:56.405
Three.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:00.125
Step four, perform the
division with the new numbers.

00:15:00.545 --> 00:15:00.755
Two.

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:03.965
Seven three divided by three equals 91.

00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:06.785
Correct answer, A 91.

00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:08.795
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:09.750
