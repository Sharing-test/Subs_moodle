00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on profit and loss.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.120
You don't need to be a genius.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.920
Just stay till the end.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.165
You will be an expert in this concept.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.439
Concept explanation, profit and
loss, my friend, is a fundamental

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.509
topic in quantitative aptitude that
delves into the financial outcomes of

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.939
buying and selling goods or services.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.870
It's all about understanding
whether a transaction made us

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.790
happy with a gain or a little sad
with a deficit, you know, a loss.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.360
It's like checking your
wallet after a shopping spree.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.825
Here are the basic terms you need to know.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.645
First up, cost, price, cp.

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.125
This is the price at which
an article is purchased.

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:50.625
Think of it as your initial
investment and listen carefully.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:52.725
It's not just the buying price.

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:57.105
It also includes any extra expenses
incurred during procurement,

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:00.400
like transportation costs or
even installation charges.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.474
All that kocha expense adds
up to your true cost price.

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.535
Next we have the selling price.

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:12.945
Sp this is simply the price
at which an article is sold.

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.930
It's the money you get back,
hopefully more than what you put in.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.195
Now the exciting part, profit gain.

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:26.205
When you are selling price, SP is
greater than your cost price, cp.

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:28.035
Congratulations my friend.

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.445
You've made a profit.

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:32.505
It's that extra han in your pocket.

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.215
The formula is simple.

00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:36.885
Profit equals SP minus cp.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:42.105
But sometimes things don't go as
planned and that leads to a loss.

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:47.085
This happens when your cost price, CP
is greater than your selling price.

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:52.185
SP a aaba, that's when you take
a hit the formula for losses.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:53.685
CP minus sp.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.080
Then we express these
outcomes as percentages.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.490
Profit percentage.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.670
Profit percent is your
profit, but measured as a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.470
percentage of your cost price.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.650
Always remember it's calculated on cp.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.840
So profit percent equals profit
divided by cp, multiplied by a hundred.

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:16.875
Similarly, loss percentage, loss percent.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:20.985
Is your loss also expressed as
a percentage of your cost price?

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:25.875
Again, on cp, my Friend loss,
percent equals loss divided by

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.380
cp, multiplied by a hundred.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
Moving on, we have the marked
price, MP, or list price.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.200
This is the price at which the
product is listed or tagged for sale.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.550
You know the big number on the price
tag, it's often higher than the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.360
cost price because the seller wants
to make some room for discounts.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.590
Smart move, right?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.480
Speaking of discounts, discount
is the reduction offered on that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.220
very marked price of an article.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.600
It's that little treat that makes
us feel happy when we buy something.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.390
Discount equals MP minus sp.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.440
Lastly, discount percentage,
discount percent.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.760
This is the discount expressed as
a percentage of the marked price.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.140
Mark my words.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.450
Discounts are always on the mp.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.890
Discount percent equals discount
divided by mp, multiplied by a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.845
hundred a. Real world relevance.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:24.105
Now, why is understanding profit
and loss crucial for professionals?

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:25.305
You ask my friend.

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:30.675
It forms the very foundation of so many
financial transactions and analysis.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.515
It helps in assessing the
profitability and viability

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:36.285
of various banking operations.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.380
First, consider loan interest calculation.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.430
Banks use these very profit and
loss principles to calculate

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.850
the interest earned on loans
and advances given to customers.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.100
It's how they make the bread and butter.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.750
Then investment returns.

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.280
Analyzing the profit or loss from
various investment portfolios helps

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.470
banks assess their financial performance.

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.280
They need to know if their money
is making more money, isn't it?

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.450
In foreign exchange operations,
these concepts are key in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.680
foreign currency trading.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.240
Profit and loss determine the gains or
losses from exchange net fluctuations.

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:16.065
A small change can mean
big profits or big losses.

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:19.755
Banks also design their fee
structures using these principles.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:24.225
Setting profitable service charges
and fees for banking products rely

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:26.325
heavily on profit and loss calculations.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.655
They need to cover their costs
and make a profit, you know.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.280
And when it comes to product pricing,
like introducing new financial products,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.140
banks use profit and loss analysis to
set competitive and profitable prices.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.730
It's a delicate balance.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.890
Finally, risk assessment.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.880
Evaluating potential financial
risks involves understanding the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.480
potential losses from different
lending or investment ventures.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.540
No one wants to lose
money, especially banks.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.800
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.980
Here are the recurring question
formats in profit and loss

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.930
with their estimated frequency.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.060
About 30% of questions are on basic
profit loss percentage calculation.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.590
These are direct questions, my
friend, involving finding profit loss.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.510
SP CP profit percent or loss
percent straightforward mostly.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.520
Then about 25% are about
discount and marked price.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.300
These questions are related to
marked price, selling price after a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.250
discount and discount percentages.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.390
Understand the MPSP discount
relationship and your golden.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.290
Another 20% involves successive
discounts, profit and loss.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.400
These are problems where an article
undergoes multiple transactions.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.110
For example, it's sold at a profit,
then perhaps at a loss, or even

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.850
involves consecutive discounts.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.530
It's like a chain reaction.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.110
About 15% are the tricky ones.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.060
Dishonest dealer, faulty weights.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.530
These are clever questions where a seller
uses false weights or cheat in some way.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.955
To gain extra profit, you need to
be sharper than the dealer here.

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:04.635
And finally about 10% are mixed concepts.

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:08.415
These combine different scenarios
such as selling two articles with

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:12.405
different profit loss outcomes or
problems involving overhead expenses.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.030
These test your overall
understanding, you know, uh.

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:17.505
Formulas plus tricks.

00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:21.075
Here are the essential formulas
and some very useful tricks

00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:22.485
for profit and loss problems.

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:24.675
These are your secret weapons, my friend.

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:25.875
For profit.

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:30.555
Profit equals SP minus cp, but
only as SP is greater than cp.

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:32.235
Of course, for loss.

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:34.335
Loss equals CP minus sp.

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:36.225
If CP is greater than sp.

00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:38.025
Simple arithmetic isn't it?

00:06:38.445 --> 00:06:39.315
Profit percent.

00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:43.575
Profit percent equals profit divided
by cp, multiplied by a hundred.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.680
Loss, percent loss, percent equals loss
divided by cp, multiplied by a hundred.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.630
Remember always on cp.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.969
Now, how to calculate SP from CP
and profit percent SP equals CP

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.630
multiplied by 100 plus profit,
percent divided by a hundred.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.729
It's like adding the profit percentage
to 100 parts of CP and to calculate

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:10.159
SP from CP and loss percent SP
equals CP multiplied by 100 minus

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:11.840
loss percent divided by a hundred.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.320
Here you are subtracting the loss
to calculate CP from SP n. Profit

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.570
percent CP equals SP multiplied by a
hundred, divided by 100 plus profit.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.340
Just reverse the operation and to
calculate CP from SP n loss percent.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.010
CP equals SP multiplied by a hundred.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.810
Divided by 100 minus.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.340
Loss for discount.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.500
Discount equals MP minus SP.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.370
For discount percent, discount
percent equals discount, divided

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.110
by MP multiplied by a hundred.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.700
Always on mp my friend.

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:45.565
Now pay attention to this
important relation between CP

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.365
mp, profit loss and discount.

00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:52.615
SP equals MP multiplied by 100 minus
discount percent divided by a hundred.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:57.745
And here's a super important one,
CP multiplied by 100 plus minus.

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:02.905
Profit or loss percent equals MP
multiplied by 100 minus discount user

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:05.005
plus for profit, and a minus for loss.

00:08:05.155 --> 00:08:06.775
This one connects everything.

00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:10.015
Trick one equal SP one profit, one loss.

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:14.095
If two articles are sold at the same
selling price and one is sold at

00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:18.025
P percent profit and the other at
P percent loss, there is always a

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:22.525
loss, and the overall loss percent
is simply P divided by 10 squared.

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:23.935
Then add the percent sign.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:29.304
So easy trick two successive percentage
change for successive profit loss

00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:33.775
or discount percentages, use the
famous formula net change equals A

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:36.324
plus B plus AB divided by a hundred.

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:39.564
Here A and B are the
individual percentage changes.

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.505
Remember to use a negative
sign for loss or discount.

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:46.885
This is your multitasking
formula, methods of solving.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:52.125
Here are various step-by-step methods
to solve profit and loss problems.

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:57.825
Pick the one that makes you comfortable
First, the formula based method, you

00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:03.405
identify the known variables, whether
it's cp, sp, profit percent loss,

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:05.895
percent mp, or discount percent.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.010
Then you choose the appropriate formula
that links your known values to the

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.780
unknown variable you need to find,
finally, substitute the values into

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.940
the formula and solve for the unknown.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.525
Straightforward, no drama.

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:25.515
Next, the percentage method using
CP as a hundred percent, assume the

00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:30.705
cost price CP of the article to be a
hundred units or a hundred percent.

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:32.745
This simplifies things a lot.

00:09:33.255 --> 00:09:37.365
If there's a profit of P percent,
your selling price as SP will

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:39.435
become a hundred plus P units.

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:41.625
So if 20% profit.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.084
SP is 120 units.

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:48.435
If there's a loss of L percent,
the selling price SP will

00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:50.145
be a hundred minus L units.

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:53.385
For 10% loss, SP is 90 units.

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:58.334
Then you use ratios or direct
proportion to find the actual values

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:00.194
based on the given information.

00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:03.550
Super effective when only
percentages are floating around.

00:10:04.334 --> 00:10:06.405
Then we have the ratio method.

00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:10.635
You convert the given profit or
loss percentage into a fraction.

00:10:10.814 --> 00:10:14.175
For example, 20% profit is one fifth.

00:10:14.474 --> 00:10:19.185
This means if CP is five units,
profit is one unit, and SP

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.344
is six units, five plus one.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.709
Similarly, 20% loss is one fifth.

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:29.870
This means if CP is five units,
loss is one unit and SP is

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.819
four units, five minus one.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.640
Then you set up a ratio for CP is to SP
and use it to find the unknown value.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.385
This method is particularly
useful for successive profit

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:43.339
and loss or discount problems.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.459
It makes calculations
look like a piece of cake.

00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:52.255
And finally, the unitary method, you
find the value of one unit or percent

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:54.145
based on the given information.

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:59.365
For example, if you are given a
20% profit on a CP of Rupees 500,

00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:01.585
first, calculate the profit amount.

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:05.215
20% of rupees 500 equals a hundred rupees.

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:07.675
Then you find the required value.

00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:14.245
SP equals CP plus profit equals rupees,
500 plus a hundred equals 600 rupees.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.670
This method is quite straightforward
when dealing with absolute values

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.650
or simple direct calculations.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.880
It's like finding one piece of the
puzzle to complete the whole picture.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.830
Shortcuts plus smart techniques, these
techniques, my friend, can help you

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.990
save valuable time during the exam.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.255
Time is money, you know.

00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:36.765
First fraction equivalence
for percentages.

00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:42.165
Memorize common percentage to fraction
conversions, like 10% is one by 10.

00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:46.875
25% is one by 4, 33 0.33% is one by three.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:49.635
16.66% is one by six.

00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:53.625
This simplifies calculations
involving percentages dramatically.

00:11:53.775 --> 00:11:55.395
No need for messy decimals.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.930
Second assume CP as a hundred when
only percentages are given or asked.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.270
Assume CP equals rupees a hundred.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.260
This makes calculating SP after
profit loss and subsequent

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.880
operations much faster.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.270
It's like having a base value
that's easy to work with.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.910
Third, the net percentage change formula.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.940
For consecutive changes like a
price increased by a percent,

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.680
then decreased by B percent.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.420
Use the formula net.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.560
Change equals A plus B, plus
A B divided by a hundred.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.310
Remember to use negative signs
for decreases or discounts.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.920
This is your go-to for multiple changes.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.720
Fourth, the ratio of a hundred plus
B percent to hundred minus D percent.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:43.525
When marked price, CP profit percentage
and discount percentage are all involved.

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:47.155
The relationship is often
simplified by this niche ratio.

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:52.015
CP divided by MP equals a hundred
minus discount percent divided

00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:53.845
by a hundred plus profit percent.

00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:59.650
This one is a gem for connecting CP
and MP directly and finally working

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.849
backward from options in some
multiple choice questions, especially

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:06.130
those involving finding CP or mp.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.329
You can test the given options by
performing the operations in reverse.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:14.410
Sometimes the answer is just hiding
in plain sight in the options.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.040
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.210
Beware my friend of these frequent
errors to avoid losing marks.

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:22.770
These are the traps.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.750
Number one, calculating profit loss
percentage on selling price, profit,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.670
or loss percentage is always calculated
on the cost price cp, unless the

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.740
question explicitly states otherwise.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.930
A common mistake is to divide
profit loss by sp no, no,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.150
no, it's CP unless specified.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.300
Number two, confusing
marked price and cost.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.750
Price discounts are always
applied on the marked price.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.910
MP not on the cost price.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.350
The discount is on the price tag, not
on what you paid for it initially.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.550
Number three, ignoring successive
changes for consecutive

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.440
profits, losses, or discounts.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.710
Simply adding or subtracting
percentages is incorrect.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.360
You must use successive percentage change
formulas or multiplicative factors.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.770
Don't be lazy here.

00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:12.565
Number four, directly adding discounts.

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:17.125
If there are two successive
discounts, say 10% and 20%, the

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.405
effective discount is not 30%.

00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:23.935
It must be calculated using the net
percentage change formula, or by

00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:25.705
applying them one after another.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.220
Remember, a discount on a
discounted price is smaller.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.860
Number five, honest dealer traps.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.110
Miscalculating, the effective cp.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.800
Or sp.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.210
When a dishonest dealer uses faulty
weights or overcharges for the quantity,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.905
always consider the actual quantity
bought or sold versus the stated quantity.

00:14:44.564 --> 00:14:45.975
Be smarter than the dealer.

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:48.555
And finally, overhead expenses.

00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:53.444
Forgetting to add overhead expenses
like transport repairs to the purchase

00:14:53.444 --> 00:14:55.694
price to calculate the true cost price.

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:58.665
These expenses are part of
your initial investment.

00:14:58.785 --> 00:14:59.805
Don't forget them.

00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:02.085
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:05.900
So my friend, let's quickly
summarize this whole concept.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.085
What is profit and loss?

00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:12.825
It is a financial concept, determining
gain or deficit from sales.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:13.725
Simple, right?

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.930
Why do we need to know this?

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.720
To assess transaction outcomes, to set
prices competitively, and to evaluate

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.400
business performance effectively?

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.080
When is it applied?

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.100
Whenever goods or services are
bought and sold everywhere.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.000
Where does it apply in business,
in banking, in retail, and

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.479
even in your personal finance,
it's everywhere around us.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.800
Who uses it?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:44.860
Business owners, bankers, retailers,
investors, and even us as consumers.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.270
How do we do it?

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:50.709
By comparing the selling price with
the cost price, and then expressing

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:52.689
these differences as percentages.

00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:54.765
Fully worked out examples.

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:58.365
Let's look at some examples
to cement our understanding.

00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:04.125
Cello example, one basic
profit calculation question.

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:10.425
A shopkeeper buys an article for 450
rupees and sells it for 540 rupees.

00:16:10.785 --> 00:16:12.959
What is the profit percentage options?

00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:14.855
A 15%.

00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:18.425
B, 20% C, 25%.

00:16:18.575 --> 00:16:22.955
D 10% understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:24.814
Step-by-step solution.

00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:29.915
Step one, first, identify the
cost, price, CP and selling price.

00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:35.675
SP here CP is 450 Rupees
and SP is 540 rupees.

00:16:35.855 --> 00:16:36.665
Easy peasy.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:37.595
Step two.

00:16:37.835 --> 00:16:39.575
Now, calculate the profit.

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:46.535
Profit as we know, is SP minus
cp, so 540 rupees minus 450

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:48.395
rupees gives us 90 rupees.

00:16:48.545 --> 00:16:49.835
That's the profit amount.

00:16:50.045 --> 00:16:53.375
Step three, finally calculate
the profit percentage.

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:58.025
Remember the formula profit
percentage equals profit divided by

00:16:58.025 --> 00:17:04.085
CP multiplied by a hundred, so 90
divided by 450 multiplied by a hundred.

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:09.775
This simplifies to one divided by five,
multiplied by a hundred, which is 20%.

00:17:10.015 --> 00:17:12.895
So the correct answer is B 20%.

00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.695
C told you it's simple.

00:17:15.055 --> 00:17:17.815
Example, two discount and marked price.

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:18.655
Question.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.625
A shirt is marked at 1,200 rupees.

00:17:21.944 --> 00:17:25.754
The shopkeeper offers a discount
of 15% on the marked price.

00:17:26.085 --> 00:17:28.665
What is the selling price
of the shirt options?

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:35.115
A 1020 B 1000 C 900 D 1050.

00:17:35.475 --> 00:17:38.115
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:39.905
Step-by-step solution.

00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:42.725
Step one, identify the marked price.

00:17:42.754 --> 00:17:44.645
MP and discount percentage.

00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:49.264
MP is 1,200 rupees and
discount percent is 15%.

00:17:49.564 --> 00:17:51.995
This is the tag price and
the discount, my friend.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:54.635
Step two, calculate the discount amount.

00:17:54.935 --> 00:18:01.235
Discount is 15% of the marked price, so 15
divided by a hundred, multiplied by 1200.

00:18:01.534 --> 00:18:06.125
This calculates to 15 multiplied
by 12, which is 180 rupees.

00:18:06.304 --> 00:18:07.325
That's your saving.

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:08.285
Step three.

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:10.475
Now calculate the selling price.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:16.385
SP is simply the marked price minus
the discount, so 1,200 rupees minus

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:19.925
180 rupees, which gives us 1020 rupees.

00:18:20.105 --> 00:18:21.635
This is what you actually pay.

00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:25.835
Alternatively, using the direct
formula, which is sometimes faster.

00:18:26.165 --> 00:18:31.325
SP equals MP multiplied by a hundred minus
discount percent divided by a hundred.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.760
So 1,200 multiplied by a hundred,
minus 15 divided by a hundred.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:42.429
This becomes 1,200, multiplied by
85 divided by a hundred, which is 12

00:18:42.429 --> 00:18:45.699
multiplied by 85, giving you 1020 rupees.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:51.310
Both ways lead to the same answer, so
the correct answer is a 1020 rupees.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.150
Example, three successive transactions.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:54.960
Question.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.500
Rohan sold an article to
Sohan at a 10% profit.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.770
Sohan then sold it to
Mohan at a 20% profit.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:07.980
If Mohan paid Rupees 660 for the article,
what was the cost price for Rohan Options?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:16.250
A 500 rupees, B 550 Rupees, C 480
Rupees, D 600 Rupees understand

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.909
the question before moving to
explanation, step-by-step solution.

00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:23.629
Step one, led the cost
price for Rohan BCPR.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.310
This is what we need to find.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.210
Step two.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.480
Rohan sold the article
to Sohan at a 10% profit.

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:35.855
So the selling price for Rohan is the cost
price for Sohan CPS equals CPR, multiplied

00:19:35.855 --> 00:19:38.285
by a hundred plus 10 divided by a hundred.

00:19:38.585 --> 00:19:43.385
This simplifies to CPR multiplied
by 110 divided by a hundred,

00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:46.175
or CPR multiplied by 1.1.

00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:48.305
Sohan paid 1.1 times what?

00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:53.045
Rohan paid Step three, Sohan then
sold it to Mohan at a 20% profit.

00:19:53.345 --> 00:19:56.075
The selling price for Sohan
is the cost price for Mohan.

00:19:56.325 --> 00:20:01.425
CPM equals CPS multiplied by a
hundred plus 20 divided by a hundred.

00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:08.595
This becomes CPS multiplied by 120 divided
by a hundred or CPS multiplied by 1.2.

00:20:08.835 --> 00:20:11.040
Mohan paid 1.2 times what Sohan paid.

00:20:11.584 --> 00:20:12.245
Step four.

00:20:12.485 --> 00:20:17.645
We know Mohan paid 660
rupees, so CPM is 660 rupees.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:22.774
Now substitute the value of CPS from step
two into the equation from step three.

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:28.774
So 660 equals CPR multiplied
by 1.1, multiplied by 1.2.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.210
This calculates to 660 equals
CPR multiplied by 1.32.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.170
Step five.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.900
Finally solve for C-P-R-C-P-R
equals 660 divided by 1.32.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.770
To make it easier, multiply numerator
and denominator by a hundred.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.895
So CPR equals 66,000 divided by one 30.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.110
Performing the division we
get CPR equals 500 rupees.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.500
So the original cost price
for Rohan was 500 rupees.

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:59.729
The correct answer is a 500
rupees C, how it all connects.

00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:00.389
Thank you.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.615
See you in the next lecture.
