00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on ratio and proportion.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.880
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.175
All right, my friends.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:15.705
Let's dive straight in.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:21.075
Ratio is fundamentally a comparison
between two quantities of the same kind

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.645
expressed as A to B or A divided by B.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.405
It reveals how many times one
quantity contains the other.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.030
For instance, if you have two apples
and three oranges, the ratio of apples

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.550
to oranges is a clear, two is to three.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.780
Remember, ratios are always
simplified to their lowest terms.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.220
No extra baggage here.

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.205
Now proportion.

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:47.775
It's essentially an
equality between two ratios.

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:54.555
If two ratios, say, A is two B and C is
2D are equal, then they are in proportion.

00:00:55.005 --> 00:01:03.695
This is neatly written as A is two B as C
is 2D or A by B equals C by D. Here, A, B,

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.305
C, and D are the terms of the proportion.

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:12.245
A and D are our extreme terms sitting
at the ends while B and C are the

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.225
mean terms right in the middle.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.355
And here's the crucial property.

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:20.825
The product of extremes is always
equal to the product of means.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:25.955
That's a ad equals bc. This little
formula is your best friend.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.710
Real world relevance.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.300
Why is this concept so important,
especially in the world of finance?

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.259
Well, ratios and proportions
are fundamental tools for

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.670
quantitative analysis.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
In banking, they are absolutely
crucial for understanding financial

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.940
statements, managing assets effectively,
and even distributing profits fairly.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.980
They empower precise calculations and
enable effective resource allocation.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.910
Imagine doing anything in finance
without comparing numbers.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.210
Applications in banking and finance.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.360
So where do we see these
brilliant applications?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.210
Firstly, in profit and loss distribution,
banks widely use ratios to distribute

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.500
profits among shareholders or
various departments, all based on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.330
their contribution or investment.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.225
It's about giving everyone their due.

00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:22.315
Then for interest calculations,
simple and compound interest rates

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.415
are applied proportionally over time.

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.674
To calculate earnings on deposits
or costs on loans, it's all

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:30.654
about growth and cost over time.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.460
We also find them in mixing problems
while sometimes theoretical.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.330
These concepts are vital in real
world resource allocation where

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.050
different assets or funds are
combined in specific proportions.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.830
Think of it as balancing
ingredients in a financial recipe.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.840
Even in time and work, though
not directly, bank operations,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.100
the concept of proportionality
applies to workforce efficiency and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.720
project timelines within a bank.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.579
Efficiency matters for partnership
business when banks collaborate with other

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.800
financial institutions or individuals.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.420
For joint ventures, profit sharing is
determined squarely by investment ratios.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.609
And finally in data interpretation,
financial reports, balance sheets,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.410
and economic data, frequently present
figures that demand ratio analysis

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
to draw meaningful conclusions
about a bank's performance.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.140
It's how you make sense
of the big picture.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.880
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.960
Now, for the question types
you'll encounter in your exam

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.780
based on past your exam patterns.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.080
Here are the common types
for ratio and proportion.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.900
About 30% are direct ratio problems,
covering basic ratio calculations,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.070
simplification, and finding missing
terms, straightforward stuff.

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:52.779
Then approximately 15% are proportion
problems where you'll find the

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.299
fourth, third, or mean proportional.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.250
Another significant portion
around 20% comes from partnership

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.260
problems focusing on profit.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.640
Distribution based on investment
or time sharing is caring.

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:07.054
Remember.

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:13.215
A similar 20% is from mixture and
allegation involving finding ratios

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.165
of mixtures or combining them.

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:16.755
Don't let them mix you up.

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:22.215
Age-based problems dealing with
ratios of ages make up about 10%,

00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:28.485
and finally, a smaller but important
5% falls under income or expenditure

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:33.195
or savings problems, applying ratio
concepts to personal finance scenarios.

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:34.905
So cover all your bases.

00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:37.365
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.055
Time for the arsenal of
formulas and clever tricks.

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:46.515
If A is two B as C is 2D, then
remember A D is equal to bbc.

00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:51.284
That's the product of extremes equals
product of means a true classic.

00:04:51.765 --> 00:04:55.005
The compound ratio of A
is two B and C is two.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:57.585
D is simply AC is to bd.

00:04:57.974 --> 00:04:59.940
The duplicate ratio of A is two.

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.175
B is a square is to B square.

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:03.535
And it's inverse.

00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:07.855
The sub duplicate ratio of A two
B is the square root of A to the

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.745
square root of B. Easy, right?

00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:16.105
The triplicate ratio of A two B is a cube,
is two B cube, and the sub triplicate

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:22.030
ratio of A two B is the cube root of A to
the cube root of B. For mean proportional.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.440
If A is to B, as B is to C,
then B is the mean proportional,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.930
and B square is equal to ac.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.050
If A is to B, as C is to D, then D is
the fourth proportional, and if A is

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.895
to B, as B is to C, then C is the third
proportional to A and B. Now for the

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:47.375
Algebra heroes component Endo, if A by
B is equal to C by D, then A plus B by

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:50.675
B is equal to C plus D by D dividend O.

00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:56.765
If A by B is equal to C by D, then
A minus B by B is equal to C minus D

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.195
by D, and the ultimate combination.

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:01.125
Component Endo and divid endo.

00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:06.974
If A by B is equal to C by D, then
A plus B upon A minus B is equal

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:12.705
to C plus D upon C minus D practice
these, they save lives or rather time.

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:18.794
A neat trick for combining ratios like A
to B and B is to C is to make the common

00:06:18.794 --> 00:06:25.305
term be equal in both ratios by finding
a common multiple methods of solving.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.600
How do we tackle these problems?

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.060
We have several powerful methods.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.730
The unitary method determine the value
of one unit or part of the ratio.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.020
Then use it to calculate other
quantities, simple and effective.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.415
The cross multiplication method for
proportions like A by B equals C

00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:50.100
by D, set up the equation and cross
multiply to solve for any unknown

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.900
quick calculation guaranteed.

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:53.594
The LCM method.

00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:57.765
When multiple ratios share a
common variable, find the least

00:06:57.765 --> 00:07:01.455
common multiple of the values
corresponding to that common variable.

00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:06.195
This helps equalize it and
combine ratios seamlessly smart.

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:11.594
The fractional method express ratios
as fractions, then perform standard

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:14.175
algebra operations to solve for unknowns.

00:07:14.385 --> 00:07:15.885
Fractions are your friends.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.870
The substitution method from a given ratio
express one variable in terms of another.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.030
Substitute this into an equation or
another ratio to simplify and solve.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.159
It's like replacing a puzzle piece.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.250
Finally, the K method, assume the common
ratio value to be K. This expresses

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.870
all quantities in terms of K, allowing
you to form equations and solve

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.060
for K or the quantities themselves.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.770
A versatile method indeed.

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:48.225
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want to solve problems faster.

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:53.385
Here are some smart techniques, ratio
equalization when given interconnected

00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:58.305
ratios like A is two B and B is to
C, quickly find the combined ratio.

00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:03.645
A is two, B is to C by adjusting terms,
so the common element has the same value,

00:08:03.765 --> 00:08:06.195
super efficient option elimination.

00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:09.325
Check given options
against problem conditions.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:12.985
This can quickly narrow down
or identify the correct answer

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:15.085
without full calculation work.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:19.465
Smart, not just hard, direct, or
inverse proportion recognition.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:22.675
Identify if quantities
are directly proportional.

00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:26.605
Both increase or decrease together
or inversely proportional.

00:08:26.844 --> 00:08:28.390
One increases other decreases.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.280
This helps set up equations
efficiently for distribution problems.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.200
Use the sum of ratios, sum the parts,
find the value of one part, then

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.450
calculate individual shares directly.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.410
And always try mental
calculation for common ratios.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.280
Saves precious seconds, common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:52.005
Now pay attention to
these pitfalls my friends.

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:53.925
Incorrect order.

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:59.055
Reversing the order of quantities
in a ratio like A is to B. Becoming

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:01.365
B is to A is a classic mistake.

00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:05.175
Order matters, direct
addition or subtraction.

00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:09.765
Trying to add or subtract ratios
directly without converting

00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:13.725
them to actual quantities or
a common base is a big no-No.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:17.685
Ratios are comparisons, not
directly summable entities.

00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:21.695
Confusing ratio with
fraction while A is two.

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:26.825
B can be A upon B. A ratio compares
while a fraction represents a

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:29.135
part of a whole distinct concepts.

00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:34.370
Ignoring units, not ensuring quantities
in a ratio are of the same units.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.370
Example, kilograms versus grams
without conversion will lead to errors.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.730
Always check your units.

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:43.180
Wrong proportionality assumption.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.410
Assuming direct proportionality
when it's inverse or vice versa

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.330
leads to incorrect equations.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.110
Be careful and watch out
for simplification errors

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.580
in complex calculations.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.230
Double check your arithmetic.

00:09:57.135 --> 00:09:58.814
WH framework summary.

00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:01.965
Let's quickly recap with our WH framework.

00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:03.435
So what is it?

00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:08.595
Ratio compares two quantities, proportion
states, equality between two ratios.

00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:10.125
Why is it important?

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:14.085
Essential for comparing quantities,
distributing values, and

00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.185
understanding relationships in data?

00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:17.625
When is it applied?

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:18.960
When comparing sizes?

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:22.454
Amounts, shares or
relating parts to a whole.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:27.465
Where is it used in financial
analysis, resource allocation, mixture

00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:29.655
problems, and data interpretation.

00:10:29.954 --> 00:10:30.765
Who uses it?

00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:35.475
Bankers, economists, business
managers, scientists, and anyone

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.335
dealing with quantitative comparisons.

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:38.685
And how is it done?

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:42.735
Calculated by dividing quantities
and simplifying to lowest terms

00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:46.485
applied by setting up equations
based on proportional relationships.

00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:46.725
Clear as day.

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:50.295
Fully worked out examples.

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:53.955
Now let's walk through some
fully worked out examples.

00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:56.205
Practical application is key.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.610
Example one combining ratios.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.710
Question if A is two, B is equal
to two is to three, and B is to

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.510
C is equal to four, is to five.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.980
What is A is two.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.020
B is to C. Options.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.720
A two is to three is to five
B, eight is to 12 is to 15 C.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.860
Six is to nine is to 12 D.
Four is to six is to five.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.100
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.840
Solution.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.690
Step one, identify the common term.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.940
The common term between A is to
B and B is to C is B. Step two

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.490
make the common term equal four.

00:11:35.775 --> 00:11:37.920
A is to, B is equal to two is to three.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.300
B is three four, B is to, C
is equal to four, is to five.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.440
B is four.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.775
The LCM of three and four is 12.

00:11:46.324 --> 00:11:51.155
Step three, adjust the first
ratio to make B12 in A is two.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:52.775
B is equal to two is to three.

00:11:52.954 --> 00:11:54.845
Multiply both parts by four.

00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:59.314
So A is two, B becomes two
into four is two, three into

00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:00.860
four equals eight is to 12.

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:06.324
Step four, adjust the second
ratio to make B12 in B is two.

00:12:06.324 --> 00:12:08.064
C is equal to four is to five.

00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:11.515
Multiply both parts by three, so B is two.

00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:13.824
C becomes four into three is two.

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:16.495
Five into three equals 12 is to 15.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:21.564
Step five, combine the adjusted
ratios with B. Now 12 in both.

00:12:21.745 --> 00:12:22.795
We combine them.

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:26.545
A is to, B is to C equals
eight is to 12 is to 15.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:27.235
Correct.

00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:29.645
Answer B. Example two.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.110
C Rues 10,000.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.060
D Rues 12,000.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.320
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.560
Step one, understand
the ratio of investment.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.010
The investment ratio for A
and B is three is to five.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.110
This implies for every three parts
A invests B invests five parts.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.800
Profit is typically distributed
in the same investment ratio,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.930
assuming the time period is equal.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.410
Step two, calculate the
total parts of the ratio.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.990
Add the ratio parts three for A plus
five for B equals eight total parts.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.110
Step three, determine
the value of one part.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.850
The total profit rupees 16,000
corresponds to these eight total parts,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:35.120
so value of one part is equal to rupees
16,000 by eight equals rupees 2000.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.700
Step four, calculate B share.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.160
B share is five parts of the profit.

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:42.290
B share equals five in two.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.635
Rues, 2000 equals rues
10,000, correct answer C.

00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:49.935
Example three mixture problem question.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:53.475
A 60 liter mixture contains
milk and water in the ratio.

00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:54.375
Two is to one.

00:13:54.645 --> 00:13:58.575
How much more water must be added
to make the ratio of milk to water?

00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:00.375
One is to two options.

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:04.935
A 20 liters B, 30 liters C. 40 liters.

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:06.405
D 60 liters.

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:10.565
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:14:10.775 --> 00:14:14.435
Step one, calculate initial
quantities of milk and water.

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:16.865
Total mixture volume is 60 liters.

00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:20.705
The initial milk to water ratio
is two is to one total ratio.

00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:22.715
Parts are two plus one equals three.

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:26.645
Initial milk two by three
into 60 equals 40 liters.

00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:30.515
Initial water, one by three
into 60 equals 20 liters.

00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:33.865
Step two, set up the
equation for the new ratio.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.715
Let X liters of water be added milk.

00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:38.455
Quantity remains 40 liters.

00:14:38.725 --> 00:14:41.395
New water quantity will
be 20 plus x liters.

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:45.655
The new milk to water ratio is
one is to two, so 40 divided

00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:47.875
by 20 plus X equals one by two.

00:14:48.085 --> 00:14:50.575
Step three, solve for X cross.

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:57.025
Multiply 40 into two equals one into 20
plus x. This gives 80 equals 20 plus x.

00:14:57.235 --> 00:14:58.915
Subtract 20 from both sides.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.000
X equals 80 minus 20,
so X equals 60 liters.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.160
Step four, state the answer.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.230
Thus, 60 liters of water must be added to
achieve the new ratio of one is to two.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.630
Correct answer D. Thank you.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.250
