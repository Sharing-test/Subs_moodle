00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on arithmetic problems.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.820
Time to Tame the Beast.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.605
This tutorial made simple step by
step for you, concept explanation.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.320
All right, my friends.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.100
Let's dive into arithmetic
problems in quantitative aptitude.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.540
There about applying our basic
mathematical operations, addition,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.300
subtraction, multiplication, and division,
our old faithfuls and fundamental

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.880
concepts to solve real world scenarios.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.805
Think of it as putting your
calculator to good use beyond

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:35.305
just splitting a restaurant bill.

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:40.555
These problems my friends, cover a
whole spectrum, percentages, profit

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:45.025
and loss, interest calculations,
time and work time, speed, distance,

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:47.334
averages, and even mixtures.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.385
Each one demands a good dose
of logical reasoning and of

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.275
course, accurate calculations.

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:55.345
No approximate answers here.

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.955
A real world relevance.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.260
Now, why are these
arithmetic skills so crucial?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
These skills are essential for anyone
aiming to build a successful career.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.310
They're like your financial GPS.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.840
You need them to accurately calculate
interest, manage loans without

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.010
breaking a sweat, analyze all that
financial data that keeps coming your.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.414
And determine profitability.

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:23.765
Basically, they're essential for
daily operational efficiency and

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.715
making sound financial decisions.

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:30.335
Imagine a banker who can't calculate
interest properly are a baba.

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:31.935
That's a disaster waiting to happen.

00:01:33.164 --> 00:01:35.475
Applications in banking and finance.

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:40.544
Let's zoom in on where these apply
specifically in banking and finance.

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:43.365
First up, we have interest calculation.

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:48.585
This is about accurately calculating
simple and compound interest on deposits,

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.804
loans, and all your investments.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.270
Then there's profitability analysis
where you figure out the net profit,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.130
gross profit, and profit margins for
various bank products and services.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.010
You know, how much charging
are we really making?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.740
Next loan amortization sounds fancy,
but it's just calculating installment

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.805
amounts and repayment schedules
for different types of loans.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:13.005
Essential staff.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.299
We also use arithmetic for forecasting
and budgeting, using historical

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.890
data and growth rates, all those
percentages to predict future financial

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.290
performance and smartly allocate funds.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.390
Don't forget risk assessment.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.739
Analyzing ratios and average
performance metrics to assess the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.190
credit worthiness of clients or
the risk involved in investments.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.770
And finally, foreign exchange.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.730
Calculating currency conversions
and understanding those percentage

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.350
changes in exchange rates.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.660
It's like being a financial wizard really.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.839
Breakdown of question types based
on past exam patterns for your exam.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.359
Here are the common
arithmetic problem types.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.530
Approximately 15% of questions
are percentage based problems,

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.609
including those tricky ones about
population changes or depreciation.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.089
Then a whopping 20% comes
from profit and loss.

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:11.005
Which covers discount marked price,
cost, price, and selling price.

00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:14.215
This is where you figure out
if the shopkeeper is truly

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:16.255
a profit buy or a lost lala.

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:20.755
Simple interest and compound
interest together make up about 15%.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:24.870
This is where money grows or shrinks,
depending on which side you are.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.760
Time and work, including its
cousins, pipes and systems,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.070
also accounts for around 15%.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.109
It's all about how many people or pipes
get how much work done in what time.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.810
Time, speed, and distance featuring
trains, boats, and streams is about 10%.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.410
Just remember when two trains
are heading towards each other,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.970
don't stand on the tracks.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.130
Averages, including problems on age
and weights contribute around 10%.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.720
And finally, ratio and proportion
based word problems like partnership,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.660
ages, and mixtures take another 10%.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.790
Lastly, a small 5% is allocated
to mensuration, which is about the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.740
area and volume of basic shapes.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.790
Sometimes knowing the volume of a
cylinder can truly save your day.

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:12.975
Formulas plus tricks.

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:15.855
All right, let's get
down to the brass tacks.

00:04:15.885 --> 00:04:20.865
The mantra of arithmetic For
percentage x percent of Y is simply

00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:26.205
X by hundred multiplied by Y. Easy
peasy lemon squeezy for profit loss.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:28.875
Profit is selling price minus cost price.

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:33.110
SP minus CP losses cost
price, minus selling price.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.945
CP minus P. Profit percentage is
profit upon CP multiplied by a hundred.

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:43.594
Remember, profit or loss is always
calculated on the cost price, not

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:45.604
the selling price unless specified.

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:49.924
This is where many friends trip
loss percentage is loss upon

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:51.544
CP multiplied by a hundred.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:58.145
For simple interest si the formula is
SI equals P into R into T upon hundred.

00:04:58.474 --> 00:05:02.315
Where P is principle R is
rate of interest and T is time

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:04.294
simple like its name suggests.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:09.474
For compound interest ci, the amount
you get is P multiplied by one

00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:14.184
plus R upon hundred raised to the
power of T and CI itself is just

00:05:14.184 --> 00:05:15.924
that amount, minus the principle.

00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:19.734
This is where money magically
multiplies thanks to interest

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:21.924
on interest for time and work.

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:26.364
If a person finishes a work in N Days,
their one day work is one by end.

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:30.594
And remember, efficiency is inversely
proportional to the time taken.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.300
More efficient, less time for time.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.260
Speed and distance.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.750
Distance equals speed multiplied by time.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.650
D equals st speed equals
distance upon time.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.330
S equals D upon T. Average speed
is total distance upon total time.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.620
And here's a classic conversion trick
to convert kilometer per hour to meter

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.705
per second, multiply by five by 18.

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:56.169
To convert meter per second to kilometer
per hour, multiply by 18 by five.

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.580
Don't mix these up, or your train
might arrive late for average.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.119
It's just the sum of observations
upon the number of observations,

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:09.250
simple but powerful, and for mixtures
and allegations when your mixing two

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.929
ingredients are different prices.

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:14.590
To get a mixture of a certain
price, you use the allegation rule.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.380
It's like finding the
perfect blend for your child.

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:19.665
Methods of solving.

00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:22.844
Now, how do we tackle these problems?

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.425
We have a few smart approaches.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:27.855
First, the unitary method.

00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:33.255
This is where you determine the value
of a single unit, like one day's work

00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:38.865
or 1% value, and then simply scale
it up to find the required quantity.

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.855
It's like finding the price of
one samosa and then figuring

00:06:42.855 --> 00:06:44.475
out the cost for a dozen.

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:47.145
Next Formula application.

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:51.705
Sometimes it's just about directly
applying the relevant mathematical

00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:56.594
formulas for topics like interest,
profit loss, or time speed, distance

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.695
to solve for that unknown variable.

00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:02.205
No rocket science, just good old formulas.

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:04.565
Then equation formation.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:09.605
This is where you translate the given
word problem into algebraic equations.

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:13.385
You assign variables to your
unknown quantities, and then

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:14.825
you solve those equations.

00:07:15.155 --> 00:07:18.695
It's like decoding a secret
message, but with numbers.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.880
Percentage conversion
is another handy method.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.800
Convert percentages to fractions or
decimals for easier calculations,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.520
especially in problems
involving successive changes or

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.260
multiple percentage operations.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.659
It simplifies things, believe me.

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:39.165
The ratio method, express
quantities as ratios.

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:44.235
This is super useful in problems
involving partnership ages or mixture

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:48.975
problems, helping you compare quantities
and distribute values proportionately.

00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:50.625
For time and work.

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:52.370
We often use the LCM method.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.390
Assume the total work as the LCM
of the individual times taken

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.590
this brilliant trick, converts the
problem into finding individual

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.570
efficiencies, simplifying calculations
immensely, no more messy fractions.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.340
And finally, a graphical slash
diagrammatic approach For some

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.659
problems, especially in time, speed,
distance drawing, simple diagrams

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.800
like relative movement can really
help visualize the scenario and

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.659
set up your equations correctly.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.860
A picture is worth a thousand
calculations sometimes shortcuts.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.700
Smart techniques, want to
save some precious exam time.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.370
Here are some shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.804
For successive percentage change.

00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:40.544
If you have successive percentage
increases or decreases, use the formula

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:46.875
A plus B plus AB by a hundred for two
changes or for multiple changes, just

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:52.245
multiply one plus or minus person one,
one plus or minus person two, and so on.

00:08:52.694 --> 00:08:54.810
It's like stacking discounts or gains.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.680
For effective rate for ci, learn
formulas for the effective rate of

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.209
interest when interest is compounded
half yearly or quarterly, this will

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:06.189
save you from complex calculations.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.050
Relative speed is your friend in time,
speed, distance for objects moving

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.939
towards or away from each other.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.530
Add their speeds for opposite directions
and subtract for the same direction.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.069
It's like two cars, one heading
north and the other south.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.350
Their effective speed is much higher.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.840
The allegation rule for mixture
problems quickly find the ratio

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.860
of quantities of two ingredients
using the allegation cross method.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.070
It's a lifesaver for those
tricky mixture problems.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.560
The assumption method for averages assume
an average close to the given numbers.

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:44.150
Calculate the deviations from
this assumed average to find

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.010
the actual average much faster.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.370
It's like taking a smart
guess and then correcting it.

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:53.720
And don't forget option testing
in multiple choice questions.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.949
Sometimes simply testing the given
options can be faster than solving

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:01.790
the problem from scratch, especially
when the options are distinct.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.090
It's like playing guest a
number with more strategy.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:09.435
All right, friends, these are the
pitfalls where most people stumble.

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:14.445
Avoid these and you're halfway
to success Unit inconsistency.

00:10:14.745 --> 00:10:19.305
This is a big one, not converting
all quantities to consistent units.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:25.035
For example, diamond R versus minutes or
speed in kilometer per R versus meetup.

00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:28.750
A second one small mistake here
can throw your whole answer off.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.240
Confusing CP and SP
incorrectly using cost.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.880
Price CP instead of selling price SP or
vice versa in profit loss calculations.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.640
Remember, profit loss is usually on
CP simple versus compound interest.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.560
Applying the simple interest formula where
compound interest is required or vice

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.140
versa, especially for consecutive years.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.510
Compound interest is like a snowball.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.210
Simple interest is just
a regular lump sum.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.209
Adding subtracting percentages directly
incorrectly, adding or subtracting

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:06.530
percentages without considering the
base on which they are calculated, a

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.689
10% increase followed by a 10% decrease
doesn't mean you are back to square one.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.490
Ignoring the base not correctly
identifying the base quantity on

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.770
which a percentage profit or loss is
calculated, this is crucial for accuracy.

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:27.145
And finally, time and work versus
individual rates mixing up total work with

00:11:27.175 --> 00:11:32.395
individual work rates, or assuming simple
addition of times work is reciprocal.

00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:32.905
Remember.

00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.445
WH framework summary.

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:38.655
Let's quickly summarize
using our WH framework.

00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:40.485
So what are these?

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:43.845
They are application-based
numerical problems covering

00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:45.525
various quantitative topics.

00:11:45.975 --> 00:11:50.205
Why do we learn them to develop
analytical and problem solving skills?

00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:51.975
Crucial for finance roles.

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:56.055
Essential my friends, when are
they applied in daily banking

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:59.745
operations, financial calculations,
and data interpretation.

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:01.075
Every single day.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:03.145
Practically, where are they used?

00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:07.195
Primarily in financial
analysis, accounting, lending,

00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:08.635
and operational planning.

00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:12.115
The backbone of finance,
you could say who uses them?

00:12:12.445 --> 00:12:17.305
Bankers, financial analysts, risk
managers, and well anyone handling

00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:20.935
monetary transactions, anyone
handling cash should know these.

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:22.459
And how are they solved?

00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:27.650
Using fundamental arithmetic operations,
specific formulas and logical reasoning.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.569
Smart work, not just hard work,
fully worked out examples.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.750
Now let's look at some examples.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:42.349
Practice makes perfect right Example,
one profit and loss question.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.380
A shopkeeper sold an item for
rupees 800 at a profit of 25%.

00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:49.939
What was the cost?

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:50.564
Price of the item?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.960
A Rupe 600.

00:12:54.675 --> 00:13:00.855
B Rupees six 40 C Rupees,
700 D Rupees seven 20.

00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:06.015
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, step-by-step

00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:08.325
solution with detailed explanation.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:08.805
Step one.

00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:16.115
Understand the relationship between
selling price, SP cost price, CP and

00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:23.525
profit percentage given SP equals 800
rupees and profit percentage equals 25%.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:29.345
We know that if there is a profit
of 25%, it means the selling price

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:35.825
is 100% plus 25%, which makes
it one 25% of the cost price.

00:13:36.185 --> 00:13:37.475
Simple maths, isn't it?

00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:40.245
Step two, set up the equation.

00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:47.655
Let our unknown cost price be X. So
one 25% of X is equal to 800 rupees.

00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:52.215
This can be elegantly written
as 1 25 divided by a hundred,

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.345
multiplied by x equals 800.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.720
Step three, solve for
X our dear cost price.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.580
Simplify that fraction.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.330
1 25 by hundred becomes
a neat five by four.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.380
So five by four multiplied
by x equals 800.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.050
To find x, you simply multiply both sides
by the reciprocal, which is four by five.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:21.209
X equals 800 multiplied by four
by five, then x equals 800 divided

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:23.099
by five, multiplied by four.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:27.300
That gives us x equals
one 60 multiplied by four.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.910
Finally, x equals six 40.

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:32.520
Step four, state the cost price.

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:37.859
The cost price of the item was Ruby
six 40 C. Told you it was simple,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.859
correct Answer B, example two.

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.235
Time and work question.

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:47.615
A can do a piece of work in 10
days and B can do the same work

00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:50.225
in 15 days if they work together.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:53.855
In how many days will they
complete the work options?

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.975
A five days B, six days?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.464
C. Eight days.

00:14:58.615 --> 00:14:59.845
D 12 days.

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:04.645
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, step-by-step

00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:06.954
solution with detailed explanation.

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:10.675
Step one, calculate
individual work rates per day.

00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:15.745
If A completes the entire work in
10 days, then a work in one day

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:17.845
is one by 10 of the total work.

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:23.694
Similarly, if B completes the same work
in 15 days, then B'S work in one day.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.890
Is one by 15 of the total work efficiency.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.360
My friends efficiency.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.319
Step two, calculate their
combined work rate per day.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.160
When our two friends a and B
work together, their individual

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.840
work rates simply add up.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.180
So combined one day work equals is
one day work plus B'S one day work.

00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:47.234
That translates to one
by 10 plus one by 15.

00:15:47.564 --> 00:15:51.405
Step three, find a common
denominator to add these fractions.

00:15:51.704 --> 00:15:55.995
The least common multiple
or LCM of 10 and 15 is 30.

00:15:56.234 --> 00:16:01.665
So combined one day work equals
three by 30 plus two by 30, which

00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:07.250
sums up to five by 30 and five by 30
simplifies beautifully to one by six.

00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:12.185
Step four, determine the total time
taken to complete the work together.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:16.415
If they can complete one by six
of the work in just one day, then

00:16:16.565 --> 00:16:18.155
they will complete the full work.

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:19.175
That's one unit.

00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:24.575
Remember, in the protocol of their
combined work rate, so time taken equals

00:16:24.725 --> 00:16:29.160
one divided by combined one day work,
which is one divided by one by six.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.460
And the reciprocal of one by
six is of course six days.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.300
Voila.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.850
Teamwork makes the dream work correct.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.260
Answer B example, three
simple interest question.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.970
A sum of money doubles itself in eight
years at a certain rate of simple

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.640
interest in how many years will it become?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.100
Four times at the same rate options.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:57.490
A 16 years B, 20 years
C, 24 years, D 32 years.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.050
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, step-by-step

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.270
solution with detailed explanation.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.350
Step one, understand the first
condition the money doubles.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.165
Let's assume our principle amount
is P when the money doubles.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.209
The final amount A becomes two P. Now,
the simple interest si earned in this

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:23.250
period is simply the amount minus the
principle, which is two P minus P,

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:28.349
giving us P. This magical doubling
happens in a time, T of eight years.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.570
Step two, use the simple interest
formula to find the rate R. We

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.639
know si equals B multiplied by R,
multiplied by t, divided by a hundred.

00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:40.885
So substitute our values.

00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:45.715
P equals P multiplied by R, multiplied
by eight, divided by a hundred.

00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:51.745
Now, divide both sides by P, assuming
P is not zero, because if P was zero,

00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:53.665
that'd be no money to double right.

00:17:54.054 --> 00:17:58.794
This leaves us with one equals R
multiplied by eight, divided by a hundred.

00:17:59.094 --> 00:18:03.575
Solving for r. We get our equals
a hundred divided by eight, which

00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:10.955
simplifies 2 25 by two or 12.5%, so the
rate of interest is 12.5% per annum.

00:18:11.254 --> 00:18:12.034
Not bad, eh.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.034
Step three, understand
the second condition.

00:18:15.155 --> 00:18:16.745
The money becomes four times.

00:18:17.044 --> 00:18:20.195
Now we want the amount A to become four P.

00:18:20.524 --> 00:18:23.225
The simple interest that needs
to be earned for this to happen.

00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:29.655
Is amount minus principle, so four P minus
B, giving us three P. We need to find the

00:18:29.655 --> 00:18:35.715
time T for this to happen using the same
rate R, which we just found as 12.5%.

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:40.754
Step four, use the simple interest
formula again this time to find the time.

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:45.735
T SI equals P multiplied by r,
multiplied by t, divided by a hundred.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.639
Substitute our new values.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:53.070
Three P equals P multiplied by 12.5,
multiplied by T divided by a hundred.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.770
Again, divide both sides by P,
so three equals 12.5 multiplied

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.240
by T divided by a hundred.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.090
To find T, multiply three by a hundred
and divide by 12.5 t equals three

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.550
multiplied by a hundred divided by 12.5.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.960
This simplifies 2D equals
300 divided by 1 25.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.899
To make calculation easier, multiply both
the numerator and the denominator by 10,

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.590
giving us D equals 3000 divided by 1 25.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.730
A quick division reveals
D equals 24 Step five.

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:27.080
State the total years.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.710
It'll become four times its
original value in 24 years.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.220
Patients, my friend,
patience, correct answer C.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.149
Thank you.

00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:36.565
See you in the next lecture.
