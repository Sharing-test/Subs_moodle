00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on et.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.500
C, f and l. CM Ever felt like
your brain needed a power up?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.550
This is it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.070
Concept explanation.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.340
Et CF my friend, or as some call it
GCD, that's greatest common device,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.560
not some new government department.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.990
Relax is basically the biggest number
that can neatly divide two or more

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.790
numbers without leaving any remainder.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.334
Imagine you have 12 ludus and 18 bures.

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:35.265
You want to pack them into
the largest possible identical

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.364
boxes without cutting any suite.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:48.810
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12,
and for 18 they are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.420
Now the common dividers
or factors are 1, 2, 3, 6.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.110
The king among them, the highest one
is six, so et CF of 12 and 18 is six.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.520
Simple, isn't it?

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:08.145
Now LCM my friend, is like the opposite
twin, the least common multiple.

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:13.335
It's the smallest positive number that
is a multiple of two or more numbers.

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:17.055
Think of it this way, you are
trying to meet up with a friend.

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:21.345
One friend comes every four
days, another every six days.

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:25.095
When will you both see them
together again at the earliest?

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.590
Multiples of four are 4, 8,
12, 16, 20, 24, and so on.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
Multiples of six are 6,
12, 18, 24, and so on.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.690
The common ones are 1224.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.810
The earliest, or least among them
is 12, so LCM of four and six is 12.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.539
It's like finding the
earliest Milah point.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.330
You see, real world relevance.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.180
Now, why on earth do we study this?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.960
You ask because it's not just
for your exam, my friend.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.670
It's got some real world fill me
Applications, especially in finance

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.560
and banking at CF and LCM, are
critical for optimizing resource

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080
allocation and scheduling financial
operations effectively, ensuring smooth

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:14.835
and coordinated banking processes.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.340
They help in finding common points or
dividing assets effectively, just like

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.110
how you'd manage your pocket money.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.210
Let's look at some examples.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.120
First, scheduling
payments or installments.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.170
It's used to find the least common
interval for recurring payments,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
deposits, or loan installments
across multiple accounts or clients.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.230
Think of it as synchronizing your
EMIS so they don't all hit at

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.120
once and give you a heart attack.

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:44.655
Next up, resource optimization.

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:49.665
When multiple departments require shared
resources, HCF can help in dividing

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:53.715
these resources into the largest
possible equal units without waste.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:58.484
It's like ensuring everyone gets
their fair share of chai, no fights.

00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:01.334
Then we have financial cycle management.

00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:05.445
This helps in determining the
smallest common period for different

00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:09.105
financial cycles or reporting
periods to synchronize operations.

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:11.505
It's all about smooth sailing, my friend.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.575
Also batch processing.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:15.315
In transaction processing.

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:20.984
HCF and LCM can help optimize the size
of batches for efficiency, ensuring

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:25.335
all transactions are processed in
synchronized groups fast, fast processing.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:30.555
You see, while a bit abstract investment
portfolio grouping concepts can apply

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:34.815
to grouping diverse investment assets
into the largest common denominations,

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.565
or finding the smallest common
timeframe for portfolio review.

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:44.445
Finally, data synchronization in
large banking systems, HCF and LCM

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:48.945
can conceptually aid in synchronizing
data updates from different sources at

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:50.955
the most efficient common intervals.

00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:54.540
So no data confusion, everything
is stuck, stuck in sync.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.810
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
Now let's talk about the question
paper card game, my friend, based

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.950
on past trends in your exam.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.270
Here are the common question
types for HCF and LCM.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.465
Approximately 30% of questions are
about simply finding HCF or LCM

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.970
of given numbers, which can even
include fractions or decimals.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:28.005
Then roughly 25% are word problems
involving HVF, like finding

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:32.055
the largest possible size or
the maximum number of groups.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:39.285
Another 25% are word problems involving
LCM, like figuring out when events

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:44.355
will coincide, or finding the smallest
number divisible by given numbers.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.570
Problems based on the relationship between
HCF and LCM make up about 10% and a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.840
smaller chunk around 5% involves problems
with numbers leaving specific remainders.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.810
Finally, another 5% are application
problems like those infamous bells

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.420
ringing or traffic lights changing color.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.170
So be ready for all these
flavors of questions.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.310
Coso.

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.229
Formulas and trick.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.450
All right, my friend time for some
jadu mantra formulas and tricks.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.599
First and foremost, the B of All formulas,
the product of two numbers is equal

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.354
to the product of their HCF and LCM.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.260
Simple logic, right?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.230
If N one and N two are your two
numbers, then N one multiplied by N

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.070
two equals HCF of N one comma n two,
multiplied by LCM of N one comma n two.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.200
Remember this, it's a golden rule.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.299
For et CF of fractions, it's et CF of
numerator divided by LCM of denominators.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.349
Sounds like Ulta.

00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:54.150
Ulta, but it works.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.219
And for LCM of fractions,
it's LCM of numerator divided

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.109
by et CF of denominators.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.489
Just flip the script literally
for et CF of decimals.

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:09.719
Convert those point value numbers
to fractions first, and then find

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.520
the et CF of those fractions.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.570
Similarly for LCM of decimals, convert
them to fractions and then find the LCM.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.990
No rocket signs here,
just basic conversion.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.670
Now for some quick ET C-F-L-C-M trics, a
simple trick for ET CF is that the et CF

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.145
of a set of numbers is always less than or
equal to the smallest number in the set.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.160
Think about it, how can the biggest
common divider be bigger than the smallest

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.710
number itself, logically impossible.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.670
Hena and for LCM, the LCM of a set of
numbers is always greater than or equal

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.740
to the largest number in the set because
the smallest common multiple must at

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.140
least be as big as the largest number.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.870
It's a multiple of
common sense, my friend.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.590
What about numbers Leaving a remainder
aha, the remainder vale problems to

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.810
find the greatest number which divides
X, Y, Z, leaving remainders A, B, C,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.800
respectively, you simply find the XCF
of X minus A, Y minus B and Z minus C.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.180
It's like removing the extra part first
and then finding the common divider.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.510
And to find the least number, which
when divided by X, Y, z, leaves the same

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:33.200
remainder R. In each case it's LCM of
x comma y, comm, Z plus R. This is like

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.180
finding the common meeting point and then
adding that leftover bit simple, isn't it?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.250
Just like adding butter chicken to
your normal biani methods of solving.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.780
So how do we actually crack these
SCF and LCM calculations, my friend?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.950
We have a few trusty methods
like your DEI, jugar.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.890
First, the prime factorization method.

00:07:56.355 --> 00:08:01.425
For ET CF, you express each number
as a product of its prime factors.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:02.295
The ET.

00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:07.155
CF is the product of the common prime
factors, each raced to the lowest power

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:09.615
it appears in any of the factorizations.

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:13.395
Think of it as finding
what's common and minimum.

00:08:13.914 --> 00:08:19.224
For LCM, you again express each number
as a product of its prime factors.

00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:22.974
The LCM is the product
of all prime factors.

00:08:23.155 --> 00:08:23.724
Yes.

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:25.674
Common and uncommon ones.

00:08:26.094 --> 00:08:27.924
Each raised to the highest power.

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:31.164
It appears in any of
the factorizations here.

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:34.015
We take everything and its highest avatar.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:38.385
Next, the division method
or long division for ET CF.

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:40.995
This is like a friendly wrestling match.

00:08:41.324 --> 00:08:45.645
You divide the larger number by the
smaller number, then you take the

00:08:45.645 --> 00:08:50.175
remainder as the new device and the
previous device as the new dividend.

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:53.985
You keep doing this TAMAL
until the remainder is zero.

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:58.845
The last device, my friend, is your
ET CF for more than two numbers.

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:03.675
Find the ET CF of the first two,
then find the ET CF of that result,

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:05.985
and the third number and so on.

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:07.574
It's a chain reaction.

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:11.235
Then we have the common
division method for LCM.

00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:13.455
This is like a group study method.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:18.470
You arrange the given numbers in a row,
divide them by a common prime factor

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.810
that divides at least two of the numbers.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.860
Write the quotient and the
undivided numbers in the row below.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.240
Repeat this circus until no two
numbers have a common prime factor.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.730
The LCM is the product of all devices
and the remaining undivided numbers.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.630
It's like collecting all the
shareholders and their profits.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.600
A quick one is the difference method
for et CF find the differences

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.980
between pairs of numbers.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.570
The et CF of the original numbers
will be a factor of these differences.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.280
In many cases, the et CF is simply
the et CF of these differences.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.110
This often simplifies finding common
factors, making life a bit easier.

00:09:59.484 --> 00:10:03.385
And finally the inspection method
for small numbers, my friend.

00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:09.444
You can often find ET CF or LCM just
by eyeballing it or listing factors or

00:10:09.444 --> 00:10:11.574
multiples until you find the right one.

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:14.214
This is less formal, but super quick.

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:17.785
For easy cases like finding
the ET CF of six and.

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:18.790
Three.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.150
Right.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.589
See, you are already an expert,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.760
Now for the Bollywood stylish shortcuts
and smart techniques, my friend,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.920
for ET CF, if the numbers are prime
to each other, meaning no common

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.810
factors other than one, their et.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.250
CF is simply one.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.300
And if one number is a factor
of another, the smaller number

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.069
is automatically their SCF.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.550
No need for complex
calculations, just deduction.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:51.560
For LCM, if one number is a multiple of
another, the larger number is their LCM.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.240
Simple logic, isn't it?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.520
It's like saying if 10 is a multiple
of five, then 10 is also their LCM

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.500
Master of the house kind of thing.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.510
Relatively prime numbers.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.880
If the at CF of two numbers is one, they
are called relatively prime or co prime.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.720
Their LCM in this special
case is simply their product.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.045
Super useful, my friend.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.300
For remainder problems, remember these
two for the smallest number, which when

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.570
divided by X, Y, Z, leaves same remainder.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.970
R, the answer is LCM, X, Y plus
R, and for the largest number,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.620
which divides X, Y, Z, leaving
same remainder R, the answer is et.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:37.950
CF of X minus R, comma y minus R,
comma Z minus R. Simple subtraction.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.785
Then at C, F. And the ultimate juga
trick for multiple choice questions.

00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:46.655
Utilize options in multiple
choice questions my friend.

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:50.795
Always try checking the given
options, especially for LCM problems

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:55.355
to see which option is divisible
by all given numbers for ET CF.

00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:57.905
Check which option
divides all given numbers.

00:11:58.204 --> 00:12:01.355
Why calculate if the answer
is already staring at you?

00:12:01.564 --> 00:12:06.755
Smart work over hard work, always
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.970
Now let's talk about the pitfalls
where most friends make culty.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.500
Don't be that friend.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.610
Confusing.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.569
HCF and LCM, this is
the number one mistake.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.980
Often friends interchange the
definitions or calculation methods

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.020
leading to incorrect answers.

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:27.705
It's like confusing your
chai with your coffee.

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:30.435
Incomplete Prime factorization.

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:35.625
Failing to break down numbers completely
into their prime factors when using

00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:37.275
the prime factorization method.

00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.460
Half done work half correct answer.

00:12:40.214 --> 00:12:46.245
Ignoring remainders in word problems
incorrectly applying at CF or LCM without

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:48.074
accounting for the given remainders.

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:52.454
The remainder is not just for
decoration, my friend, calculation

00:12:52.454 --> 00:12:56.505
errors, simple arithmetic mistakes,
especially when dealing with

00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:58.755
larger numbers or multiple steps.

00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:01.485
Basic addition,
subtraction, multiplication.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.745
Al can mess up the whole
problem, not identifying common

00:13:05.745 --> 00:13:07.574
factors or multiples correctly.

00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:11.594
Missing some common factors or
multiples when listing them out.

00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:16.545
It's like forgetting a friend from your
WhatsApp group and finally applying

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:20.745
formulas blindly not understanding
the context of the problem and

00:13:20.805 --> 00:13:24.735
applying an incorrect formula,
especially for problems involving

00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:26.805
remainders or specific conditions.

00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:28.245
Don't be a formula.

00:13:28.245 --> 00:13:30.824
Parrot my friend, be a formula wise Owl.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.390
WH framework summary.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.800
All right, my friend.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.210
Let's do a quick recap of the whole
film with our W framework summary.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.100
Picture Abbie B style.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.570
So what is it?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.500
What is it?

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.990
HCF is the greatest common device.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.450
LCM is the least common multiple.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.470
Easy peasy.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.700
Why do we need it?

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.990
It helps in grouping, dividing
and finding common occurrences

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.010
or smallest common points like
finding the perfect meetup spot.

00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:00.355
When do we use it?

00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:04.765
Applied when finding largest common
divisions, synchronizing events,

00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:06.745
or distributing items Equally.

00:14:07.015 --> 00:14:09.205
Imagine distributing met high, fairly.

00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:13.645
Where is it used in scheduling,
resource allocation, measurement,

00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:15.505
and solving numerical problems.

00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:16.735
It's everywhere.

00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:19.165
Like Jaap Supreme, who uses it?

00:14:19.405 --> 00:14:23.305
Mathematicians, engineers,
planners, and anyone dealing with

00:14:23.305 --> 00:14:25.495
numerical optimization or grouping.

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:28.405
Basically anyone who wants to be smart.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.449
How is it calculated using prime
factorization division method or

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:35.670
inspection based on definitions.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.230
We have all the weapons ready,
fully worked out examples.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.850
Now let's get our hands dirty with
some live examples, my friend,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.400
because seeing is believing, right?

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:53.370
Example one basic ET CF and
LCM calculation question.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.290
Find the ET CF and LCM of 24, 36, and 40.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:14:59.505
Options.

00:14:59.805 --> 00:15:08.175
A at CF equals four LCM equals 360 B
at CF equals eight LCM equals one 20

00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:16.965
C at CF equals 12 LCM equals seven 20
D at CF equals two LCM equals two 40.

00:15:17.295 --> 00:15:21.405
Understand the question before
moving to explanation, step-by-step

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:23.445
solution with detailed explanation.

00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:26.925
Step one, prime
factorization of each number.

00:15:27.314 --> 00:15:33.645
24 is two multiplied by two, multiplied
by two multiplied by three, which is

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:40.515
two cubed times three, to the power of 1
36 is two multiplied by two, multiplied

00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:45.675
by three, multiplied by three, which
is two squared times three squared, and

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:52.185
40 is two multiplied by two, multiplied
by two, multiplied by five or two

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.000
cubed times five to the power of one.

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:57.735
Step two, find ET CF to find the et.

00:15:57.735 --> 00:15:58.155
CF.

00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:01.095
Take the common prime factors
with the lowest power.

00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:03.825
The only common prime factor here is two.

00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:07.965
The lowest power of two is two
squared, which comes from 36.

00:16:08.115 --> 00:16:11.080
So et CF equals two
squared, which is four.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.340
Step three, find LCM to find.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.570
The LCM take all prime factors,
both common and uncommon

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.710
with the highest power.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.970
The highest power of two is
two cubed from 24 and 40.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.630
The highest power of three
is three squared from 36.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.270
The highest power of five is five
to the power of one from 40, so LCM

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.650
equals two cubed times three squared
times five to the power of one.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.370
Which is eight times.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.420
Nine times five.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.430
That's 72 times five, giving
us 360, correct Answer.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.290
A simple, isn't it?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.805
Example, two word
problem, LCM application.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.770
Question three.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:57.270
Bells ring at intervals of 10,
15, and 20 minutes respectively.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.010
If they all ring together at 10:00 AM at
what time will they next ring together?

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:11.760
Options a 10:30 AM B 10:45 AM C 11:00
AM D 11:15 AM Understand the question

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.380
before moving to explanation, step-by-step
solution with detailed explanation.

00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:18.794
Step one, understand the problem.

00:17:19.064 --> 00:17:23.054
The bells will ring together again at
a time that is a common multiple of

00:17:23.054 --> 00:17:26.865
their individual ringing intervals to
find the next time they ring together,

00:17:26.865 --> 00:17:32.685
my friend, we need to find the least
common multiple or LCM of 10, 15, and 20.

00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:36.345
It's like finding their next
synchronized alarm clock moment.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:42.470
Step two, find the LCM of 10, 15
and 20 using prime factorization.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.020
Prime factors of 10 are two times five.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.720
Prime factors of 15 are three times five,
and prime factors of 20 are two times,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.600
two times five, or two squared times five.

00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:59.795
So the LCM equals two squared times
three times five, which is four times.

00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:02.075
Three times five, giving us 60.

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:05.465
This means the bells will ring
together every 60 minutes.

00:18:05.765 --> 00:18:08.315
Step three, calculate
the next ringing time.

00:18:08.615 --> 00:18:13.385
They last rank together at 10:00 AM They
will next ring together after 60 minutes.

00:18:13.595 --> 00:18:20.165
Now 60 minutes is exactly one R right,
so 10:00 AM plus one r equals 11:00 AM.

00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:22.055
Time for a tea break maybe.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.620
Correct answer C. Easy
as making Maggie example.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:26.980
Three.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.400
Relationship between
ET CF and LCM question.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:30.970
The ET.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.870
C. F of two numbers is
12 and the LCM is 1 44.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.410
If one of the numbers is 36,
what is the other number?

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.340
Options.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:47.710
A 48 B 64 C. 70 2D 84 Understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.680
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:53.635
Step one, recall the fundamental formula.

00:18:53.905 --> 00:18:55.885
Remember our golden rule, my friend?

00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:59.485
The product of two numbers is
equal to the product of the et.

00:18:59.485 --> 00:19:05.365
C, F and LCM, so N one multiplied by
N two equals et CF multiplied by LCM.

00:19:05.815 --> 00:19:09.145
Step two, identify the
given values here, ET.

00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:10.075
CF is 12.

00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:14.005
LCM is 1 44, 1 number and one is 36.

00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:17.245
Let's call the other number
and two our mystery number.

00:19:17.595 --> 00:19:20.535
Step three, substitute the
values into the formula.

00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:25.485
So 36 multiplied by N two
equals 12 multiplied by 1 44.

00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:30.885
Step four, solve for the unknown
number N two N two equals 1 44

00:19:30.885 --> 00:19:33.345
multiplied by 12 divided by 36.

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:36.105
We can do some quick mathy
Jiggle Bundy here, right?

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:38.895
12 goes into 36, exactly.

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:39.915
Three times, right?

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:42.885
So 36 divided by 12 gives us three.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:48.030
Now N two equals 1 44 divided
by three, and that gives us 48.

00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:51.330
Correct answer a, isn't it?

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.439
Thank you.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.754
See you in the next lecture.
