00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.960
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on age problems.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.620
Ever.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.930
Felt like your brain needed a power up.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.720
This is it, concept explanation.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.230
Age problems in quantitative aptitude
involve calculating the current or past

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.509
future ages of individuals or groups,
or determining relationships between

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.030
their ages based on given conditions.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470
These problems typically involve
linear equations, ratios,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.729
and sometimes percentages.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.090
The core idea is to translate the word
problem into mathematical expressions and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.070
then solve for the unknown ages, often
representing current ages with variables

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.430
like X or Y. Real world relevance.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.169
Understanding age problems is crucial
for you as it develops logical

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:54.030
reasoning and equation solving skills
vital for data interpretation, and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.099
quick decision making in operations.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.959
This topic tests your ability to
quickly analyze numerical data

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.940
and derive precise conclusions.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:08.015
A skill directly applicable to financial
calculations and customer interactions.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.664
It helps with loan eligibility,
calculating age for various loan

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:14.375
products with age restrictions.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.884
It's useful for retirement
planning, understanding

00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:22.145
age-related financial planning for
clients for investment schemes.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.590
Age criteria for different investment and
insurance policies in customer service.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.210
Quickly grasping age related details
during customer inquiries for data

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
analysis, interpreting demographic
data, often involving age groups

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.900
and for policy implementation.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.230
Applying age specific
guidelines in various policies.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.100
Breakdown of question types
based on common or exam patterns.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.070
Age problems typically
fall into these categories.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.590
Problems based on ratios of ages.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.840
Comprising 40% of questions.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.789
For example, the ratio of a's age
to B'S age is three is to five.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.120
After 10 years, the ratio
will be four is to six.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.985
Find their current ages problems based on
some or difference of ages making up 30%.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:13.554
Example, the sum of the ages of
a father and son is 60 years.

00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:17.035
10 years ago the father's
age was five times the son's

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:18.924
age find their current ages.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:23.515
Problems involving past,
present, and future ages are 15%.

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:28.285
Example, five years ago, A was
twice as old as B. Five years.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:32.875
Hence, A will be 1.5 times as old
as B. Find their current ages.

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:35.394
Problems involving averages of ages.

00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:36.595
Account for 10%.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.929
Example, the average age of 30
friends in a class is 15 years.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.859
If the teacher's age is included,
the average becomes 16 years.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.299
Find the teacher's age.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.780
Problems involving multiple
individuals are 5%.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.910
Example, the sum of the ages of
three friends, PQ and R is 90 years.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.109
10 years ago, the ratio of their
ages was one is to two, is to three.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.670
Find their current ages.

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:02.894
Formula and tricks.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:05.595
Here are some useful formulas and tricks.

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:11.415
Current age represent current age as
a variable, like X age N, years ago,

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:17.505
current age minus N, for example, X minus
N, age N years, hence, or after N years

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:20.265
current age plus N, for example, X plus.

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:25.785
If the ratio of ages A is to B is X
is to Y, and after T years it becomes

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.984
B is to Q. The difference in cross
products of ratios remains constant.

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:33.734
Initial difference is Y minus
x, and the final difference is

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:37.725
Q minus P. If the difference is
the same, then directly equate.

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:40.335
If not, make it the same by multiplying.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.540
Alternatively, for ratio changes,
let current ages be X, K and YK.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.510
Then you set up the equation as XK
plus T upon YK plus T equals P by Q.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.320
Then solve 4K for N times more or less.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.880
Be careful with phrasing.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.270
A is N times B means A is n. A is n
times older than B often implies A

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.210
equals B plus NB, which is N plus one B.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.220
However, in most competitive exams N
times older than is also interpreted

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.230
as just a is NB, always assume A
is NB unless the context strongly

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.480
suggests otherwise average age.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.090
This is simply the sum of ages divided by
the number of persons methods of solving.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
Let's discuss the methods
for solving these problems.

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.390
First, using linear equations,
also known as the algebraic method.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.520
You assign variables to the
unknown ages, usually current ages.

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.190
Then translate each condition or statement
in the problem into a mathematical

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.560
equation involving these variables.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.469
This forms a system of linear equations.

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:54.390
Solve the system using substitution
or elimination methods to find

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.770
the values of the variables.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.400
Finally verify the solution with
the original problem statement.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.270
Second, using ratios and proportions when
problems involve ratios of ages Represent

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.910
the ages as multiples of a common factor.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.865
For example, three x five x.
Set up proportions based on the

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:17.055
given future or past age ratios.

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:20.355
Solve the resulting equation
for the common factor.

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:24.615
Then calculate the actual ages
by substituting the common

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.775
factor back into the expressions.

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:31.785
Third, the difference in ages method,
which relies on a constant difference.

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:35.534
Recognize that the difference
between the ages of two people

00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:37.755
always remains constant over time.

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:42.315
Use this constant difference to
set up equations or verify age

00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:47.085
relationships at different points in
time, be it past, present, or future.

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:52.034
This method is particularly useful when
the problem provides age differences

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:56.114
at different points in time, or
implicitly relies on this property.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.670
Fourth trial and error or
option elimination when multiple

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.080
choice options are provided.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.700
Sometimes substituting the options back
into the problem statement can be a

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.440
quick way to find the correct answer.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.490
Start with easier options like
middle values or round numbers.

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.485
And check if they satisfy all conditions.

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:19.175
Eliminate options that clearly
contradict the problem statement.

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:23.975
This is not a primary solving
method, but a useful crosscheck or

00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:28.385
quick approach for simpler problems,
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:31.085
Here are some shortcuts
and smart techniques.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:32.915
Age differences, constant.

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:37.625
Always remember that the age difference
between any two individuals remains

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:38.770
the same throughout their lives.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.350
Use this property to form equations
or simplify complex ratio problems.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.390
Unitary method for ratios.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.110
If a ratio changes over time,
calculate the unit change.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.340
For example, if A is to B is
two is to three, and after five

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.940
years it's three is to four, then
one unit represents five years.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.510
This assumes that the difference between
parts of the ratio remains the same.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.450
If not, make it the same by multiplying
future past age adjustments when

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.440
moving from present to future add
years, when moving from present to

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.050
past, subtract years, be careful with
a go and hence average age concept.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.220
When a new person joins a group and
the average age changes, the new

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.290
person's age can be calculated as.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.159
Old average plus change in average
into new number of persons.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.870
Focus on one variable.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.520
Try to express all ages in terms
of a single variable to simplify

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.090
equation formation, common
mistakes and misconceptions.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.110
Let's look at common mistakes
and misconceptions incorrectly.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.919
Setting up equations, the most
frequent error is translating.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.140
A is twice as old as B, as a plus, two
equals B, or other misinterpretations

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.525
instead of A equals two B. Confusing
times and times older than as

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:03.105
discussed usually n times older than
means n times that is A equals NB.

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:08.745
However, some may interpret it as A
equals b plus NB, that is N plus one.

00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:13.335
B. Stick to A equals NB unless
context strongly suggests otherwise

00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:15.585
not accounting for time difference.

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.870
Forgetting to add or subtract
years for past or future ages.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:24.865
For example, if B is X years old now,
then five years ago, B was X minus

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.895
five, not X applying ratios directly.

00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:32.424
If A to B is two is to three now and
after five years, it's three is to four.

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:36.355
One cannot directly say two x
plus five or three x plus five.

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:39.924
The common factor X for the
ratio two is to three is

00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:41.395
distinct from the common factor.

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.895
Y for three is to four.

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:47.515
Use 2K plus five upon three k
plus five equals three by four.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.850
Arithmetic errors.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.080
Simple calculation mistakes while
solving the equations, not reading

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.560
the question carefully misinterpreting
what the question is asking.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.000
For example, asking for a son's age
while calculating a father's age.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.860
WH framework summary.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.235
Let's summarize using the WH framework.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:10.314
What mathematical problems,
determining ages or age relationships.

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:11.095
Why?

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:15.175
Essential for testing logical
reasoning and equation solving skills

00:09:15.475 --> 00:09:20.575
when applied in scenarios involving
time-based numerical relationships where

00:09:20.814 --> 00:09:25.345
frequently encountered in your exam,
financial planning and demographics.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.770
Who friends preparing for aptitude tests,
financial professionals, data analysts.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.105
How solved using linear equations ratios
and constant age difference principles.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.840
Fully worked out examples.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.120
Example, one question.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:48.030
The ratio of the present ages of A
and B is four is to five, five years.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.140
Hence, the ratio of their ages
will become five is to six.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.060
What is the present age of b?

00:09:54.725 --> 00:10:03.185
Options, a 20 years B, 25 years, C,
30 years, D 35 years understand the

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:08.465
question before moving to explanation,
step-by-step solution first.

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:11.345
Represent current ages using a variable.

00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:14.495
Let the present age of a B four x years.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.850
Let the present age of B be five x years.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.220
Second express ages five years,
hence age of a after five years

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.110
will be four x plus five years.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.160
Age of B after five years will
be five x plus five years.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.910
Next, set up the equation
based on the future ratio.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.800
According to the problem, the
ratio of their ages five years,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.810
hence will be five is to six.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.940
So four x plus five upon five x
plus five equals five upon six.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.240
Now solve the equation for X cross.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.580
Multiply six into four x plus five
equals five into five x plus five.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.830
This gives 24 x plus
30 equals 25 x plus 25.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.110
Subtract 24 x from both sides.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:08.920
30 equals 25 x minus 24 x plus 25, which
simplifies two 30 equals x plus 25.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:15.250
Subtract 25 from both sides, X
equals 30 minus 25 so x equals five.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.470
Finally, calculate the present age
of B. Present age of B equals five

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:26.080
x equals five into five equals 25
years, correct answer B. 25 years.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.219
Example two question.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.180
The sum of the ages of a
father and his son is 60 years.

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:36.260
Six years ago the father's age
was five times the son's age.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.319
What is the present
age of the son options?

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.699
A 12 years B. 14 years C. 18 years.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.109
D. 20 years.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.349
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.145
Step-by-step solution.

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:53.204
First, define variables for present ages.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.964
Let the present age of
the father be F years.

00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:58.635
Let the present age of the son be S years.

00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:02.145
Second, form an equation
for the sum of present ages.

00:12:02.415 --> 00:12:04.214
F plus S equals 60.

00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:04.915
Equation one.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.599
Third Express ages six years
ago, father's age, six years ago

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:11.939
was F minus six years son's age.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.160
Six years ago was S minus six years.

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.099
Fourth form an equation
based on their ages.

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:21.030
Six years ago, according to the
problem, six years ago, the father's

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.795
age was five times the son's age.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:26.719
So F minus six equals
five into S minus six.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.239
Equation two fifth, simplify.

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:32.989
Equation two F minus six
equals five S minus 30.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.319
This gives F equals five s minus 30
plus six, so F equals five s minus 24.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.119
Equation three six.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.790
Substitute equation
three into equation one.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.849
Five S minus 24 plus S equals 60.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.780
This simplifies to six
s minus 24 equals 60.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:57.780
Then six S equals 60 plus 24, so six
s equals 84, therefore S equals 84

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.210
upon six, which means S equals 14.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.820
Finally find the present age of the sun.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.030
The present age of the sun is 14
years, correct Answer B. 14 years.

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:09.415
Example three question.

00:13:09.595 --> 00:13:13.075
The average age of five members
of a family is 25 years.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:16.645
If the youngest member is five
years old, what was the average

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:19.555
age of the family just before
the birth of the youngest member?

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:23.815
Options a 20 years B. 22.5 years?

00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:30.595
C. 25 years D. 27.5 years understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:32.270
Step-by-step solution.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.329
First, calculate the total
current age of the family.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.040
Average age equals some of ages
upon number of members, so 25

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.870
equals some of ages upon five.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.400
Thus some of ages equals 25
into five equals 1 25 years.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.204
Second, determine the situation just
before the youngest member's birth.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.699
The youngest member is five years old now.

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:55.819
This means the event just
before the birth of the youngest

00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:57.620
member occurred five years ago.

00:13:57.895 --> 00:14:00.505
At that time, there were
only five minus one.

00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:04.165
That is four members in the family
as the youngest wasn't born yet.

00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:07.795
Also, each of the other four
members would have been five years

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.025
younger than their current age.

00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:13.165
Third, calculate the sum of ages of
the four older members at that time.

00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:16.885
Current sum of ages of all
five members is 1 25 years.

00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:21.265
Current age of the youngest member
is five years, so current sum of ages

00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:25.765
of the four older members equals 1
25 minus five equals one 20 years.

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:29.905
Five years ago, just before the
youngest was born, each of these four

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.645
older members was five years younger.

00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:36.055
Total reduction in their combined age
equals four into five equals 20 years.

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:39.385
Therefore, the sum of ages of
the four older members five

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:41.185
years ago equals a hundred years.

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:44.635
Finally, calculate the average
age of the family just before

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:45.505
the youngest member's birth.

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:49.565
Average age equals some of ages of
four older members five years ago.

00:14:49.715 --> 00:14:53.765
Upon number of older members, average
age equals a hundred upon four equals

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:56.885
25 years, correct Answer C, 25 years.

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:57.635
Thank you.

00:14:57.695 --> 00:14:58.925
