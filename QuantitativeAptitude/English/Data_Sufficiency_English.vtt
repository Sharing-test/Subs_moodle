00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on data sufficiency.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.110
Let's decode this concept like detectives.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.780
Concept explanation.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.200
So what is this data sufficiency you ask?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.110
It's a crucial topic in quantitative
aptitude that tests a very special skill.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.900
The goal isn't to find the right answer,
but to figure out if you even have

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.150
enough information to find the answer.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:32.394
It's like a detective asking, do I
have enough clues to name the culprit?

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.224
Not who is the culprit.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:37.165
You get a question and two statements.

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:41.964
Your mission should you choose
to accept it is to decide if one,

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:46.194
both or neither of these statements
is enough to solve the mystery.

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:49.224
It's all about logical
deduction, my friend.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.269
Real world relevance and don't
think this is just for your exam.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.390
As an officer, you'll be swimming in data.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.730
This skill is your life jacket.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.050
It teaches you to quickly see if
you have enough information to

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.130
make a solid decision stopping
you from making a mess of things.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.170
Imagine looking at financial reports,
customer data, or market trends.

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:17.845
Data sufficiency is what helps you
make accurate judgements without

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.405
getting lost in the numbers.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.870
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.490
Now, what kind of mysteries
will you be solving based on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.110
past patterns in your exam?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.500
These questions love to dress
up in different costumes.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.200
About 20% of the time they pop up from the
number system and simplification world.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530
Testing you on number
properties and basic math.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.060
Another 15% come from averages,
ratios, and proportions.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.479
Then you have another 15% disguised as
percentages profit and loss problems.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.179
The biggest chunk around 20% is
from time, work and speed distance.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.609
And of course we can't forget menstruation
and geometry and algebra and equations

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.399
each taking up about 10% of the stage.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.199
Finally, probability and permutations
and combinations also make a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.329
guest appearance with a 10% share.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.100
Quite a party, isn't it?

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.214
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:21.524
Now for the secret sauce, the tricks,
while the specific formulas change

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:26.174
with the topic, like profit loss or
time work, the real magic for data

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:28.304
sufficiency is about your approach.

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:32.589
The biggest trick is to stop yourself
from actually solving the problem.

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:40.115
I know it feels wrong, but your only job
is to check if it can be solved always.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:44.855
And I mean, always check statement
one alone, then statement two alone.

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:49.025
This helps you eliminate options
faster than a rumor spreads.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.535
Only combine them if they
both fail on their own.

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:55.805
The goal is to find a
unique single answer.

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.855
If a statement gives you one
solid answer, it's sufficient.

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:04.685
If it gives you a, maybe this,
maybe that situation, it's useless.

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:09.935
Also, watch out for sneaky, redundant
information where both statements

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:14.525
are just saying the same thing in
different clothes and a golden rule.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:18.395
Don't use your own gun
stick only to what's given.

00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:20.415
Methods of solving.

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:23.895
So how do we tackle these
beasts systematically?

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:28.005
First, understand the question,
what are they really asking for?

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.715
What is the target value?

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:35.295
Next, analyze statement one alone,
pretend statement two doesn't even exist.

00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:37.755
Can you get a single definite answer?

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.645
If yes, it's sufficient.

00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:44.115
If no it's not, then do the
same first statement, two alone.

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:49.425
Forget everything you saw in statement
one is statement two, enough on its own.

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:55.305
If neither of them works alone and only
then you can bring them together, combine

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:57.405
their powers like a superhero came up.

00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:00.765
If together they give you
a unique answer, great.

00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:05.325
If they still leave you guessing, then
even together, they are not sufficient.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.730
Finally, you pick the option that
matches your brilliant analysis,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.220
shortcuts, and smart techniques.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.490
Want to be even faster.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.590
Use the elimination strategy.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.480
If you find that statement one alone is
sufficient, you can immediately throw

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.610
out any option that says it's not.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.100
Another smart technique is to focus on
variables, see what you need to find,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.570
and then check if the statements give you
enough independent equations to find it.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.210
For some questions, especially
with inequalities, you can test a

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.469
couple of values if different test
values give you different answers.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.880
The statement is insufficient,
and please practice with a timer.

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:50.000
It trains your brain to
assess, not calculate.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.710
Finally learning to categorize the
question type, algebra, geometry,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.015
et cetera, helps you recall
the right concepts in a flash.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.320
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.710
Now, let's talk about the
traps people fall into.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.850
The number one mistake is actually
solving the entire problem.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.810
Don't do it.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.260
You're checking for sufficiency,
not the answer itself.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.310
Another big one is assuming
information that isn't given.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.659
Stick to the script.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.490
When you are checking one statement,
do not peek at the other one.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.580
They must be evaluated
independently first.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.230
If you see a problem that looks like
it needs a PhD in mathematics to solve,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.240
you are probably on the wrong track.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.790
You are trying to solve it, not check it.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.300
And lastly, always
consider all possibilities.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.430
If a question mentions integer, think
about positive, negative, and zero.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.440
Don't leave any stone unturned.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.630
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.540
So to put it all in a
nutshell, what is it?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.920
A type of question where you
determine if given data is enough

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.410
to solve a problem, why do we do it?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.220
To test your logical reasoning
and analytical skills?

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.780
When is it applied?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.340
When evaluating information to make
decisions, especially under time

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.620
constraints, where will you find it?

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.730
It's common in competitive
exams, business analysis, and

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.500
other problem solving scenarios.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:17.940
Who needs this?

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.229
Aspiring banking professionals,
analysts, and anyone needing

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.940
to make data-driven decisions.

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:25.469
And how do we do it?

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.880
By systematically evaluating
each statement individually and

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.510
then combined without actually
calculating the final answer.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:35.549
Fully worked out examples.

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.580
Example, one question.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.820
What is the two digit number statements?

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:44.414
One, the sum of the digits is nine.

00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:50.505
Two, the digit in the 10 is twice
the digit in the units place options.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.719
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.650
B. Statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.120
C. Both statement one and statement
two together are sufficient to

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.390
answer the question, but neither
statement alone is sufficient.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.500
D. Both statement one and
statement two together are not

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.755
sufficient to answer the question.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.390
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.609
All right, let's break it down.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.909
Statement one says the
sum of digits is nine.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.599
Hmm.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.130
So it could be 18, 27, 36, 45.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.659
Lots of possibilities.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.510
So statement one alone is not sufficient.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.539
Now let's look at statement two alone.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.330
The 10 digit is twice the units digit.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.340
This could mean 21, 42, 63, or 84.

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:43.320
Again, too many choices.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.440
So statement two alone is not sufficient.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.340
But what happens when we
combine them from statement one?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.755
We have D plus U equals nine from
statement 2D equals to u. Let's substitute

00:07:57.145 --> 00:08:02.425
two u plus U equals nine, which means
three U equals nine, so U is three.

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:04.975
If U is three, D must be six.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:06.835
The number is 63.

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:11.455
We found a unique answer, so both
statements together are sufficient.

00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:17.995
The correct answer is C. Example
two question, what is the present

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:20.425
age of the sun statements?

00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:26.475
One, the sum of the present ages of
the father and the son is 60 years.

00:08:27.075 --> 00:08:31.905
Two, five years ago, the father's
age was five times the son's age.

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:33.480
Options.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.250
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.020
B. Statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.540
C. Both statement one and statement
two together are sufficient to

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.260
answer the question, but neither
statement alone is sufficient.

00:08:52.694 --> 00:08:57.915
D. Both statement one and statement
two together are not sufficient To

00:08:57.915 --> 00:09:02.625
answer the question, understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:03.645
Okay.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:06.765
Let's solve this family drama statement.

00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:07.125
One.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:12.285
Father plus son is 60,
so F plus S equals 60.

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:18.915
We can't solve this F. Could be
50 and S 10 or F 40 and S 20.

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:19.870
Useless alone.

00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:27.025
Now statement two, five years ago,
father was five times the son, so F minus

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:30.175
five equals five times S minus five.

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:34.615
This simplifies to F
equals five S minus 20.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.315
Still one equation, which two variables.

00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.295
Also useless on its own.

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.365
Now, let's combine them.

00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:43.825
We have two beautiful equations.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.565
F equals 60 minus S and
F equals five s minus 20.

00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:54.805
We can set them equal 60 minus S
equals five s minus 20, a little bit

00:09:54.805 --> 00:10:01.705
of algebra magic, and we get 80 equals
six s. So S equals 80 divided by six.

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:03.925
It's a fraction, but who cares?

00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:06.890
It's a unique, definite
value for the son's age.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.490
Therefore, both statements
together are sufficient.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.060
The correct answer is C. Example three.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:21.110
Question is X, a positive number
statements one x squared minus four

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.330
x plus three is less than zero.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.770
Two x squared minus x
minus six equals zero.

00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:28.984
Options.

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:33.334
A statement one alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:37.655
B. Statement two alone is
sufficient to answer the question.

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:42.755
C. Both statement one and statement
two together are sufficient to

00:10:42.755 --> 00:10:46.354
answer the question, but neither
statement alone is sufficient.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.690
D. Both statement one and statement
two together are not sufficient to

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.130
answer the question, understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.560
The question is, a simple yes
or no is X positive statement

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.975
one gives an inequality.

00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:07.555
X squared minus four x plus
three is less than zero.

00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:13.405
Factoring this, we get X minus one
into X minus three, less than zero.

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:17.605
For this to be true, X must be
squished between one and three.

00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:21.685
Any number between one and three
is definitely positive, right?

00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:24.145
So we get a definite yes.

00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:26.515
Statement one alone is sufficient.

00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:28.915
Now, let's check statement two.

00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:30.025
Just for practice.

00:11:30.445 --> 00:11:34.735
It says X squared minus
X minus six equals zero.

00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:35.665
Factoring.

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:39.805
This gives X minus three
into X plus two equals zero.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:45.625
So X could be three, which is positive, or
it could be minus two, which is negative.

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:48.285
Since we get a maybe yes, maybe no.

00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:52.755
This statement is not sufficient
since statement one alone was enough.

00:11:52.844 --> 00:11:54.765
We don't need to combine anything.

00:11:54.974 --> 00:11:57.314
The answer is a thank you.

00:11:57.435 --> 00:11:59.025
See you in the next lecture.
