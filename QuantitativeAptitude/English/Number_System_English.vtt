00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on number system.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.890
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.340
So what exactly is the number system?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.680
Well, it's basically a fancy way of
representing and expressing numbers,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.960
like giving them names and addresses.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
You see, this foundational
concept is the main pillar for

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.349
all quantitative aptitude topics.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.290
Here, we'll dive deep into
different types of numbers.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.380
Yes, your natural, whole integers,
rational, irrational, and the real ones.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.550
Understanding their unique properties
and learning the golden rules

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.100
for operations like Divisibility
factors, multiples at C-F-L-C-M,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.350
and even those pesky remainders.

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:55.475
A solid grip on this topic helps you
simplify calculations faster than you

00:00:55.475 --> 00:01:00.425
can say at CF, and solve numerical
problems with absolute precision.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:02.675
No more pulling your hair out, my friends.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.504
Real world relevance.

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:08.450
Now, why should an officer care
about this simple, my friend?

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.580
For an officer, a robust understanding
of number systems is like having a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.930
superpower for accurate financial
calculations and interpreting data.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.730
Like a pro, it helps you spot
patterns in transaction data, ensuring

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.930
your daily banking operations are
numerically precise and error free.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.430
No room for Alta here.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.670
Breakdown of question types based on past
patterns in your exam, we've identified

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.380
some recurring question formats.

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:41.785
About 30% of questions typically involve
divisibility rules and remainders.

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:46.225
Basically figuring out who divides
home and what's left behind

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:48.024
the arithmetic detective work.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:53.484
Then roughly 25% are all about
SCF and LCM applications.

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:56.755
Your highest common factor
and least common multiple.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.914
The dynamic duo of number theory.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
Fractions and decimals make up about 15%.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.760
Don't let those dots
and slashes scare you.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.150
Friends.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.740
They're not that complicated.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.200
Once you get the hang of it, another
15% explores properties of numbers like

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.400
whether a number is even or odd, prime
or composite, rational or irrational.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:22.464
Then we have 10% dedicated to
finding the unit digit of a large

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:26.214
power or counting the number of
zeros at the end of an expression.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.125
These are often quick wins
if you know the tricks.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:34.945
Finally, a small but important 5% is
on basic operations and simplification.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.600
Direct arithmetic, no drama,
just pure calculation.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.660
Formulas plus tricks.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.070
All right, let's talk about the
secret sauce, the formulas plus tricks

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.019
that will make your life easier.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.210
First up, master your Divisibility
rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.799
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and so on.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.829
For instance, a number
is divisible by three.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.940
If the sum of its digits is divisible
by three, a real time saver.

00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:09.045
Remember the golden ET c, F and LCM
relationship for any two numbers,

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:13.515
say A and B. Their product is always
equal to the product of their et.

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:14.835
C, F and LCM.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:22.065
That's A multiplied by B equals et CF of
A and B multiplied by LCM of A and B. Then

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.135
we have prime factorization breaking down
a number into its prying building blocks

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.045
to find ET C-F-L-C-M or other properties.

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:31.845
It's like DNA for numbers.

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:36.565
For unit digit problems, understand
the cyclicity, how the unit digits

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:37.975
repeat themselves in a cycle.

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:41.364
For powers like the unit
digits of powers of two.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.730
Two.

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:42.834
Race to the power one.

00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:43.285
Two.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:43.945
Race to the power.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:44.209
Two.

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:44.545
Two.

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:45.325
Race to the power.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.045
Three, two.

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.454
Race to the power four, two.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:49.345
Race to the power five, and so on.

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:49.885
Go.

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:54.805
2, 4, 8, 6, 2. So the Cyclicity is four.

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:59.245
When finding the number of zeros at the
end of an expression, you essentially

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:03.115
count how many pairs of two cross five
are present in its prime factorization.

00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:08.065
Usually this is dictated by the number of
fives because twos are just everywhere.

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:13.465
And for remainder theorem basics, just
remember when a number N is divided

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:18.954
by a device D. N can be written as
Q times D plus R, where Q is the

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.904
quotient, and R is the remainder.

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:25.945
And R must always be greater than or
equal to zero, but strictly less than D.

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:30.025
Finally, my friend, don't confuse
face value and place value.

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:33.475
Face value is just the digit
itself, plain and simple.

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:37.705
But place value, ah, that depends
on where it's sitting in the number.

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:40.105
Its position, its AKA you could say.

00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:41.685
Methods of solving.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.295
Now how do we tackle these problems?

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.085
Let's talk about the methods
of solving my friends.

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:50.475
The prime factorization
method is your versatile tool.

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.455
Like a Swiss Army number system.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.355
You decompose numbers into their
prime factors to determine ET

00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:59.175
C-F-L-C-M and to analyze divisibility.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:03.225
This method is genuinely versatile
for many number system problems.

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:03.915
Trust me.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:07.215
Then there's the division
method for ET CF and LCM.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:11.865
Use successive division for ET CF,
also known as the Euclidean algorithm.

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:13.125
Sounds fancy, right?

00:05:13.515 --> 00:05:18.705
And simultaneous division for LCM for
remainder method apply basic remainder

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:23.925
properties like the remainder of A plus
B by N is the sum of remainders of A by

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.775
N and B by N. It's like magic almost.

00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:30.105
Or use advanced remainder
theorems for more complex

00:05:30.105 --> 00:05:31.310
problems when things get tricky.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.260
Pattern recognition
for unit digits is key.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.740
Observe the repeating pattern
of unit digits for powers of a

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.490
number to quickly find the unit
digit of large powers saving you.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.660
Precious exam time.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.150
Counting factors simple as chi.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.590
Just add one to each exponent in the
prime factorization and multiply them.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.660
For example, if N is equal to P, race to
the power A times Q, race to the power.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.950
B. The number of factors is a
plus one multiplied by B plus one.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.280
And for Divisibility by three and
nine, use the sum of digits method.

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:06.640
Repeatedly sum the digits until
a single digit is obtained.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.000
If it's three, six, or nine,
it's divisible by three.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.280
If it's nine, it's divisible by nine.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.830
Simple arithmetic, great results, right?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.680
Shortcuts plus smart techniques, time
for the shortcuts, plus smart techniques

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.750
that will make you a number ninja.

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:27.045
Ever heard of negative remainders
for faster calculation?

00:06:27.195 --> 00:06:31.935
Sometimes using a negative remainder,
for example, seven divided by

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:33.525
eight has remained a seven.

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:38.085
Or you can think of it as
minus one can simplify larger

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:40.034
calculations significantly.

00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:41.895
It's a real brain hack.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.620
For LCM of fractions, remember
it's the LCM of numerator divided

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.990
by the et CF of denominators.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.090
And for et CF of fractions, it's
the et CF of numerator divided

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.250
by the LCM of denominators.

00:06:57.615 --> 00:06:58.995
Just flip the logic.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:01.545
See approximation and options.

00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:05.985
Elimination is a lifesaver
for problems involving large

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:07.844
numbers or complex expressions.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:13.125
Use divisibility rules or unit digit
concept to smartly eliminate options

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:15.284
without doing the full calculation.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.170
Cyclicity of unit digits is something
you should almost memorize or quickly

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.390
deduce the patterns for common digits.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.030
0 1 5 6. Always have the same
unit digit, predictable hair.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.380
Four and nine.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.610
Have a cyclicity of two and 2, 3, 7, 8.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.015
Have a cyclicity of four.

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.604
Then we have some classic sums.

00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:45.414
Sum of first N natural numbers is N
into n plus one by two sum of squares

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:51.505
of first N. Natural numbers is N into
N plus one into two N plus one by six.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:57.925
And the sum of cubes of first N natural
numbers is N to n plus one by two.

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:58.855
Hold squared.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.895
Keep these in your back pocket.

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:04.185
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:08.505
Now let's talk about the common
mistakes and misconceptions

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:10.215
that drip up many friends.

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.045
First, confusing ET.

00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:18.495
CF and LCM incorrectly applying the logic
of et CF instead of LCM and vice versa,

00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:23.330
thinking they are interchangeable, like
two sides of a coin, which they are not.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.130
The divisibility rule for seven oh, this
one is often complex and prone to errors.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.370
So many friends avoid it or misapply it.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.720
Be careful here.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.700
Sometimes it's faster to just
divide remainder versus quotient.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.840
Confusing these two terms or
misinterpreting the remainder theorem.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.420
Remember, remainder is what's left.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.970
Quotient is how many times it went in.

00:08:48.449 --> 00:08:52.410
Incorrectly applying Cyclicity,
forgetting to adjust the power

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.180
by dividing the cyclicity.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.000
For example, for two race to 13, it's
13 divided by four, gives a remainder

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.204
of one, so the unit digit is two, race
to one, not two, race to 13 itself.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.949
Assuming prime numbers, mistaking
composite numbers like 1, 9,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.050
25, et cetera for prime numbers
without proper verification.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.940
And a very important note.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.730
One is neither prime nor composite.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.140
It's a special number like that one
unique relative in every family.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.030
Then there are errors with fractions
and decimals, basic calculation errors

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.135
when adding, subtracting, multiplying,
or dividing fractions and decimals.

00:09:33.765 --> 00:09:35.175
These are silly mistakes.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.105
Avoid them.

00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:38.895
And finally, not considering zero.

00:09:39.195 --> 00:09:44.175
Forgetting that zero is a whole number,
an integer, and a rational number, or

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:46.575
its specific properties in operations.

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.795
Zero has its own personality.

00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:49.215
You see?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.990
WH framework summary.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.180
To quickly summarize with our WH
framework, just like a quick recap before

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.850
the main movie, what is the number system?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.230
It's simply the classification
properties and operations of

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.670
different types of numbers.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.260
Why do we learn it?

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.070
Because it forms the fundamental
building block for all

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.930
quantitative aptitude problems.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.620
You can't build a strong house
without a strong foundation, right?

00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:21.155
When is it applied in virtually
all numerical problem solving

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:22.745
contexts in your exams?

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:25.145
Where is its real world relevance?

00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:29.405
It's the basis of data analysis,
financial calculations, and

00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:33.095
logical reasoning in daily life,
everywhere numbers are involved.

00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:34.865
Who needs to know this?

00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:40.715
Well, friends, bankers, data analysts, and
truly anyone dealing with numerical data.

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:42.485
And how do you master it?

00:10:42.845 --> 00:10:47.165
By understanding number types,
divisibility rules, H-C-F-L-C-M,

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:48.515
and remainder theorem.

00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:49.175
Got it.

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.334
Fully worked out.

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:56.735
Examples Now for the exciting
part, fully worked out examples.

00:10:57.245 --> 00:10:59.975
Let's see how all this
theory comes to life.

00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:04.485
Example one Divisibility rule question.

00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:10.395
If the number 4, 2, 5, 7 3 star
is divisible by three, what

00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:14.714
is the smallest digit that can
replace the asterisk options?

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.474
A zero B one.

00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:23.625
C 2D three understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:27.255
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:31.095
Step one, recall the
divisibility rule for three.

00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:33.375
A number is divisible by three.

00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:38.355
If the sum of its digits is
divisible by three, step two, sum

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.005
the known digits of the given number.

00:11:40.685 --> 00:11:45.605
Sum of known digits equals
four plus two, plus five, plus

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.305
seven plus three, which is 21.

00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:53.825
Step three, add the missing digit
represented by the asterisk to the sum.

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:57.665
The total sum will be 21 plus asterisk.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.180
Step four, find the smallest
digit for asterisk that makes

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.160
the total sum divisible by three.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.180
We need 21 plus asterisk
to be a multiple of three.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:15.260
If asterisk is zero sum equals
21 plus zero, which is 21 and 21

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.060
is perfectly divisible by three.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.600
Since we are looking for the
smallest digit, zero is a

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.995
definite possible candidate.

00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.155
Example two ET.

00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:27.005
CF and LCM application question.

00:12:27.485 --> 00:12:32.105
The ET CF of two numbers is
12, and their LCM is 360.

00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:36.965
If one of the numbers is 60,
what is the other number Options?

00:12:37.265 --> 00:12:41.705
A 72 B 84 C 96.

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:43.085
D 1 0 8.

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:46.745
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.805
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:55.515
Step one, recall the relationship
between ET C-F-L-C-M and two

00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:57.855
numbers for any two numbers.

00:12:58.005 --> 00:13:01.455
The product of the numbers is
equal to the product of their ET.

00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:02.685
CF and LCM.

00:13:02.985 --> 00:13:07.545
So product of numbers equals
ET CF multiplied by LCM.

00:13:07.845 --> 00:13:10.665
Step two, identify the given values.

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:12.255
HCF is 12.

00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:15.795
LCM is 360 1 number is 60.

00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:20.850
Let the other number be x. Step
three, set up the equation using

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:26.219
the formula 60 multiplied by
X equals 12 multiplied by 360.

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:31.589
Step four, solve for the
unknown Number x. X equals 12

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:34.319
multiplied by 360 divided by 60.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.040
This simplifies two x equals 12
multiplied by 360 divided by 60, and

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:47.055
360 divided by 60 is exactly six,
so x equals 12 multiplied by six.

00:13:47.604 --> 00:13:51.115
Which gives us X equals
72, correct answer.

00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:56.185
A 72 Example, three unit digit question.

00:13:56.665 --> 00:14:00.984
What is the unit digit of
seven to the power 105 Options.

00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:05.995
A one B three C seven D nine.

00:14:06.564 --> 00:14:09.474
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:10.104 --> 00:14:12.805
Step-by-step solution
with detailed explanation.

00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:13.495
Step one.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.390
Determine the cyclicity of
the unit digit of seven.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.930
Look at the unit digits of
the first few powers of seven.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:27.620
Seven to the power one is seven seven to
the power two is 49, so the unit digit

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.490
is nine seven to the power three is 343.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.230
Unit digit is three seven
to the power four is 2,400.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.530
One.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.405
Unit digit is one seven to the power five.

00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:41.605
Is 1, 6, 8, 0, 7.

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:42.985
Unit digit is seven.

00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:46.255
The unit digits repeat
in a clear cycle of four.

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:51.565
That is 7, 9, 3, 1, so
the cyclicity is four.

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:54.955
Step two, divide the
power by the cyclicity.

00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:57.355
The given power is 105.

00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:59.605
Divide 105 by four.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:06.295
When you divide 105 by four, you get four
multiplied by 26 plus a remainder of one.

00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:08.785
Yes, the remainder is indeed one.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.550
Step three, use the remainder
to find the unit digit.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.730
The unit digit of seven to the power 105
will be exactly the same as the unit digit

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.040
of seven to the power one because our
remainder was one and the unit digit of

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.500
seven to the power one is naturally seven.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.290
Correct answer C seven.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.400
Thank you.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.050
See you in the next lecture.
