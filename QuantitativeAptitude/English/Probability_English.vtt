00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on probability.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.930
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.390
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.910
So what is this big shot?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.439
Probability aray.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.400
It's just a fancy, mathematical
way of measuring chance.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
It's all about figuring out how
likely something is to happen.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.380
Simple.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.419
Let's break down the jargon.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.445
An experiment is any action, like
tossing a coin or rolling a dye.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.505
An outcome is just one possible result,
like getting ahead or rolling a three.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:43.695
An event is a specific outcome or a
set of outcomes you are interested

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:48.855
in, like getting an even number,
which would be two, four, or six.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:54.075
The sample space, which we call
s, is the complete menu of all

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:56.565
possible outcomes for a coin toss.

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:57.765
It's just head.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:02.695
Still for a die, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:03.325
Easy.

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.425
No, a favorable outcome.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:10.465
E is simply the outcome that makes you
happy, the one you are looking for.

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.615
The big formula, the
heart of it all is the.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.780
P of E equals the number of your
favorable outcomes divided by the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.789
total number of possible outcomes.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.000
And remember this golden rule, probability
is always between zero and one.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.190
Zero means impossible.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.770
Like spotting a unicorn in your backyard.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.210
One means it's a sure thing
like the sun rising tomorrow.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
Finally, a quick look at event
types, mutually exclusive events.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.730
Can't happen together.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.350
Like rolling a one and a two on
the same Die independent events

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.880
don't care about each other.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.000
A coin toss result doesn't
affect the next one.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.759
And dependent events are clingy.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.720
One event changes the probability
for the next, like drawing

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.550
cards without putting them back.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.650
Real world relevance.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.905
Now you might ask, sir,
where will I use this?

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:10.914
Everywhere my friend understanding
probability if key for assessing

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:15.715
risks like banks, figuring out loan
defaults or predicting market trends,

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:19.885
it helps you make smarter decisions
with your money and investments.

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:23.695
So yes, it's not just
for exams, it's for life.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.180
Breakdown of question types for your exam.

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.430
The question setters have their favorites.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.810
Let's see what they are.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.920
About 40% of questions are
basic probability problems

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
involving coins, dice, and cards.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
Another 25% are about bags and balls
where you are pulling out colored

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.755
balls and finding the chances.

00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:49.304
Then 20% of problems mix in
permutations and combinations, which

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:51.135
you need for complex selections.

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:55.484
Conditional probability, finding
the probability of something given

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:59.234
that something else has already
happened, makes up about 10%.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.614
And finally, 5% of questions
will test your understanding of

00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:08.204
mutually exclusive or independent
events, formulas and tricks.

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:10.964
All right, time for the secret masala.

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:13.575
The formulas, the basic one is.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:19.165
P of E equals N of E by N of
S for a complimentary event.

00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:23.215
The probability of something not
happening is just one minus the

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.105
probability that it does happen.

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:25.675
Simple.

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:33.565
The addition rule is for or cases P of
A or B is P of A plus P of B. But you

00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:36.445
must subtract the overlap P of A and B.

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:39.565
If they are mutually
exclusive, just add them.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.185
P of A plus pb.

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:47.845
The multiplication rule is for and cases
for independent events, it's PA times pb.

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:53.484
For dependent events, it's PA times
the probability of B happening, given.

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:58.375
A has already occurred, and of
course, our old friends permutations

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.274
for arrangements and combinations
for selections are here to help.

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:05.155
Here's the ultimate trick in a problem.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:09.054
When you see and think
multiplication, when you see or

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.575
think addition methods of solving.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.800
Let's talk strategy first is
the direct calculation method.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.060
The bread and butter.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.710
Define the experiment.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.260
Count all outcomes for NFS.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.020
Count the favorable ones for
NFE and divide done Next, the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.550
complimentary event method.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.320
This is a clever shortcut.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.110
If a question asks for at least one, it's
often easier to calculate the probability

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.380
of none and subtract that from one work.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.890
Smart.

00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:41.355
Not hard.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.930
Then we have the method of using
permutations and combinations.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.210
First, decide if order matters,
permutation or not combination.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.920
Then use the right formula to find
your total and favorable outcomes

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.710
and divide for multi-stage problems.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.870
Three diagrams are your best friend.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.850
Draw out the parts, multiply probabilities
along each branch, and add up the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.040
parts that give you the desired result.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.130
Lastly, the conditional
probability method.

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:13.065
Identify the two events.

00:05:13.155 --> 00:05:18.044
A and B, find the probability of
both happening B of A and B. Find

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:23.414
the probability of the condition B of
B, and then divide them B of A by B

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.289
equals B of A and B divided by B of B.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.445
B. Shortcuts and smart
techniques want to be faster.

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:36.145
Of course, you do first, simplify early,
cancel out parts of fractions as you go to

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.055
keep numbers small for at least problems.

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:42.115
Always remember the one
minus P of none trick.

00:05:42.265 --> 00:05:43.405
It's a lifesaver.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.625
Recognize standard scenarios.

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:49.105
Memorize common probabilities
for dice sums or cards.

00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.005
Break down complex problems
into smaller, manageable chunks.

00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:55.765
Then combine them using the and or rules.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.090
And finally, practice mental calculation
for small permutations and combinations.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.070
It'll save you precious seconds,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.619
And now the Hall of Shame, the common
mistakes to avoid a classic blunder is

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.200
confusing, permutations and combinations.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.669
Remember, permutation is for position,
combination is for committee.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.270
Another is incorrectly
identifying the sample space.

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.080
Double check.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.299
You've counted every single possibility.

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:30.205
Please don't commit the sin of adding
probabilities for independent events.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.735
You must multiply them.

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:36.085
And conversely, don't multiply
For mutually exclusive events, you

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:40.615
must add a very common error is
not accounting for replacement.

00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:43.705
Always check if an item
is put back or not.

00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:46.015
It changes everything for the next draw.

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:50.815
Finally, be careful with phrases
like, at least or at most, read

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:54.445
them carefully and think if the
complimentary approach is easier.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.560
W Edge Framework summary.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.140
So to quickly revise, what is it, the
math of chance, why do we learn it to

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.420
assess risk and make smart choices?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.110
When do we use it in any
situation with a random element?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.310
Where is it used?

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.535
Finance games, whether you name it,
who uses it, analysts, scientists,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.110
and now you, how do we calculate it?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.420
Desired outcomes divided by total
outcomes, fully worked out examples.

00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:25.185
All right, let's solve some problems.

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:28.875
Example, one basic probability dice.

00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:32.565
Question two, fair dice
are rule simultaneously.

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:36.315
What is the probability that
the sum of the numbers appearing

00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:38.865
on the dice is seven options?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.710
A one by six.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.740
B one by 12, C one by nine, D five by 36.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.330
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.360
Step one, each DAI has six faces.

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:59.430
Two dice mean the total outcomes
are six times six, which is 36.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.960
That's our NFS.

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:04.020
Step two, we want the sum to be seven.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.020
Let's list the winning
pairs, one comma six.

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:11.409
Two comma five, three comma
four, four comma three, five,

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:13.479
comma two and six comma one.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.560
That's six.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.669
Favorable outcomes.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.650
So N of E is six.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:24.489
Step three, probability is N of E over
N of S. So that's six divided by 36.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.919
Step four, simplify the fraction.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.710
Six divided by 36 is one by six.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.980
The correct answer is a.
Example two probability with

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.900
combinations balls in a bag.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.830
Question.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.159
A bag contains five red
balls and three blue balls.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.909
If two balls are drawn at random
from the bag without replacement,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.200
what is the probability that
both balls drawn are red options?

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:54.050
A five by 14 B, 10 by 28 C 25 by 64.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.460
D one by four.

00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:59.665
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:00.625
Step one.

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.715
Total balls are five plus
three, which is eight.

00:09:04.015 --> 00:09:05.335
We are drawing two balls.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.015
Since the order doesn't matter.

00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:08.515
We use combinations.

00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:12.475
The total number of ways to pick
two balls from eight is C of eight,

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:14.605
comma two, which calculates to 28.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.170
This is our N of S step two.

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:19.090
We want both balls to be red.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.740
There are five red balls.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.280
The number of ways to choose
two red balls from five is C of

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.020
five, comma two, which is 10.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.630
This is our N of E. Step three.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.699
The probability is N of E over
N of S. So 10 divided by 28.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.020
Step four, simplifying 10
by 28 gives us five by 14.

00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:43.335
So the answer is a. Example,
three probability with cards

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:44.985
mutually exclusive events.

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:49.755
Question, what is the probability
of drawing a king or a queen from

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:55.665
a well shuffled standard deck of 52
playing cards, options, a two by 13 B,

00:09:55.845 --> 00:10:00.285
four by 13 C, one by 13 D one by 26.

00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:03.225
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:04.410
Solution.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.849
Step one, the total number of outcomes
is the number of cards in the deck.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.800
So N of S is 52.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.069
Step two, let's find the
probability for each event.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.459
The probability of drawing
a kink is four out of 52.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.939
The probability of drawing a
queen is also four out of 52.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.010
Step three.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.140
Can a card be a king and a queen?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.740
No.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.050
So these events are mutually exclusive.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:32.240
Step four for mutually exclusive events
with, or we simply add the probabilities.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.770
So four by 52 plus four
by 52 equals eight by 52.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.740
Step five, let's simplify eight by 52.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.680
Divide both by four,
