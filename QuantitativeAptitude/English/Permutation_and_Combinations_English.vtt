00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome my friend to today's lecture
on permutation and Combinations.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.750
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.630
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.210
All right, let's dive right in.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
Permutation and combination are the
fundamental superstars of mathematics.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.700
Used to count the number of ways
different events can play out.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.300
They are especially handy when
you're dealing with arranging or

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.370
selecting items from a big group.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.575
First up, permutation.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:35.445
A permutation is simply an
arrangement of objects where the

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.455
specific order is everything.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.515
The order of the items
matters a great deal.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:46.305
For example, if you have three letters,
A, B, and C, the arrangements A, B, C,

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:53.355
A, C, B, B, A, C, B, CA, CA, B, and C, BA
are all considered different permutations.

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:57.435
It answers the question, how many
ways can you arrange a certain

00:00:57.435 --> 00:00:59.055
number of items from a set?

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:03.254
Then we have its school
relaxed cousin combination.

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:08.625
A combination is a selection of objects
where the order is completely irrelevant.

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.245
Who cares who came first?

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:15.735
For example, if you choose two letters
from A, B, and C, selecting AB is

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.045
exactly the same as selecting ba.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:19.634
It's all one group.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:23.655
It answers the question, how many
ways can you choose a certain

00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:25.275
number of items from a set?

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.545
The key difference to burn
into your brain is this.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.509
Order matters in permutation, but
order does not matter in combination.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.419
Simple, real world relevance.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
And you might ask, where
on earth do we use this?

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.440
Well, permutation and combination
are your best friends.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.639
When calculating the number of ways
to arrange security codes or select

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.869
a specific number of candidates for
a job from a larger pool, they are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.130
absolutely crucial for understanding
probability in big fields like

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.320
risk assessment and data analysis.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000
Breakdown of question types based
on recurring question formats.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.970
Here are the types of problems
you'll most likely face.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.130
About 30 to 35% of questions are a
direct application of the formulas

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.730
straight up, asking for the number
of arrangements or selections.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.170
Then 25 to 30% are problems
with some strings attached.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.690
Some restrictions or conditions like WS
must always be together, or these two

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.550
people can never be in the same team.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.070
You can also expect word-based problems
about 15 to 20% of the time, asking for

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.910
the number of distinct words you can
form from the letters of another word.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.500
Number-based problems like forming
numbers with specific digits under certain

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.260
conditions make up about 10 to 15%.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:48.239
And finally you might see a few on
circular permutations arranging things

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.640
in a circle or probability questions that
need PNC to find the answers each making

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.920
up about five to 10% of the problems.

00:02:56.595 --> 00:03:01.845
Formulas plus tricks now for the magic
spells, the key formulas and simple

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:06.885
tricks, the foundation of it all is the
factorial shown by an exclamation mark.

00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:11.865
The factorial of N or N factorial
is just the product of all positive

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:16.665
integers, less than or equal to N.
And remember, by convention, zero

00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:19.005
factorial, zero factorial is one.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.120
The permutation formula, which
calculates the number of permutations

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.120
of N distinct items taken R at a
time is P of NR equals N factorial

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.340
divided by N minus R factorial.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.760
The combination formula for selecting
R items from N is C of NR equals N

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.350
factorial, divided by the product of
R factorial and N minus R factorial.

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:47.515
And if you have repetitions, like in the
word apple, the number of permutations

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:52.225
is n factorial divided by the factorials
of the counts of each repeated item.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:57.625
For trick one, remember this, if events
are connected by and you multiply the

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:02.785
ways, if it's, or you add the ways
for trick two, look for keywords,

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:08.185
arrangement, order, or position, screen
permutation, words like selection,

00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:10.945
choose, or committee whisper combination.

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:12.855
Methods of solving.

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:15.705
So how do we actually solve these things?

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.015
Let's talk methods first.

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:20.084
The fundamental principle of counting.

00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:21.644
This has two parts.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:26.655
The multiplication principle says if one
thing can be done in M ways and another

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:31.575
independent thing in N ways, then both
can be done together in M times N ways.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:36.425
The addition principle says if one
event can happen in Nway and another

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:40.535
in Nway, but they can't happen at
the same time, then either one or

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:42.425
the other can happen in m plus.

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:42.515
Nway.

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:46.665
When the problem screams, order
is important, you can directly

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:48.195
use the permutation formula.

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.285
Just identify your n
and r and plug them in.

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:54.825
Similarly, when the order of
selection is not a big deal,

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:56.505
use the combination formula.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:59.325
Just identify your n and r and solve.

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:03.885
Finally, for those tricky conditional
problems, we have special tactics.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.055
If certain items must always be
together, just bundle them up

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:09.675
and treat them as a single unit.

00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:14.414
If certain items must never be together,
find the total arrangements without

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:18.075
any rules, and then subtract the
arrangements where they are together.

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:23.445
And if an item has a specific reserved
position, just place it there first and

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:24.715
then worry about arranging the rest.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.690
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.000
Want some shortcuts to look like a pro?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.849
First, simplify factorials when you can.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.170
You don't always need to calculate the
whole thing, cancel out common terms.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.190
Second, it really helps to
memorize common factorial values

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.080
like for four, five, and six.

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:43.980
Trust me.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.680
Third, use the symmetry in combinations.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:53.125
C of NR is the same as C of N and
minus R, so C of 10 comma eight is

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:57.775
much easier to calculate as C of 10
comma two for questions with at least

00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:00.295
or at most use complimentary counting.

00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:04.345
It's often easier to find the total
minus the cases you don't want.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.260
A great visual trick for arrangement
problems is to draw empty

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.940
slots and fill them one by one.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.780
And when a problem looks like a
monster, just break it down into

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.530
smaller, manageable pieces, solve
each one, and then combine the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.930
results usually by multiplication,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.430
Now a word of warning about common traps.

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.020
The number one mistake is confusing,
permutation and combination.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.380
Always ask yourself,
does the order matter?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.570
Another classic error is messing up the
addition and multiplication principles.

00:06:39.924 --> 00:06:43.585
Remember and means multiply or means add.

00:06:44.184 --> 00:06:48.474
People also often over count or
under count, especially when there

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.065
are repeated letters in a word.

00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:55.135
Be careful with at least, or at
most problems, they can be tricky.

00:06:55.674 --> 00:07:00.414
Don't forget to apply all the given
restrictions in a question and please

00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:04.104
double check your calculations,
especially with factorials.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.885
A small slip can lead to
a completely wrong answer.

00:07:08.744 --> 00:07:10.275
W framework summary.

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:14.984
So to quickly wrap it all up,
what are we talking about?

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:19.724
Methods for counting arrangements,
which is permutation and selections.

00:07:19.784 --> 00:07:20.984
Which is combination.

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.705
Why do we need them to figure
out the total number of

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:26.685
possible outcomes for events?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.400
When do we apply them in any situation
involving arranging items, selecting

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.740
groups, or calculating probabilities?

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:40.350
Where are they used in probability,
statistics, computer science, risk

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.050
analysis, and many real world scenarios.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.229
Who uses this?

00:07:44.984 --> 00:07:50.385
Statisticians, data analysts, risk
managers, and basically any friend who

00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:52.664
needs to count a lot of possibilities.

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:54.554
And how do we do it?

00:07:54.974 --> 00:08:00.375
By using our trustee factorial permutation
and combination formulas along with

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.265
fundamental counting principles.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.560
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.380
Example, one permutation question,
how many different four digit numbers

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.539
can be formed using the digits?

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:17.880
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If no digit is repeated.

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:25.155
Options, A one 20 B 360
C seven 20 D four 80.

00:08:25.544 --> 00:08:28.365
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:28.755 --> 00:08:29.265
All right.

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:34.574
For the solution first, we need to form
a four digit number from six distinct

00:08:34.574 --> 00:08:39.855
digits without repetition, since 1,
2, 3, 4 is a different number from 4,

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:42.375
3, 2, 1, the order clearly matters.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.000
This is a classic permutation problem.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.660
Our total number of
available digits N is six.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.910
The number of digits we need to
arrange R is four, so we apply the

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.180
formula PNR, which is B six four.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.790
This equals six factorial divided
by six minus four factorial, which

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.250
is six factorial over two factorial.

00:09:05.665 --> 00:09:10.945
Calculating this, we get seven 20
divided by two, which gives us 360.

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:13.675
The correct answer is B 360.

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:17.065
Example two combination question.

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:20.725
A committee of three members
is to be formed from a group

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.615
of five men and four women.

00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:27.290
In how many ways can the committee
be formed, if it must consist of

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.455
exactly two men and one woman?

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:30.545
Options.

00:09:30.814 --> 00:09:35.645
A 20 B 30 C 40 D 50.

00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:38.735
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:40.324
Let's break this down.

00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:44.915
We are forming a committee, so the
order of selection does not matter.

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:46.655
It's a combination problem.

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:51.485
The condition is that we need
exactly two men and one woman.

00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:53.939
So first, let's select the men.

00:09:54.574 --> 00:09:56.824
We need to choose two men from five.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.595
This is C five two.

00:09:58.954 --> 00:10:00.845
The formula gives us 10 ways.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:02.975
Next, we select the woman.

00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:05.495
We need to choose one woman from four.

00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:08.765
This is C four one,
which gives us four ways.

00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:13.715
Since the committee needs men and women,
we use the multiplication principle.

00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:17.795
We multiply the ways to select
men by the ways to select women.

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:20.615
So 10 times four equals 40.

00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:22.895
The correct answer is C 40.

00:10:23.515 --> 00:10:27.235
Example three permutation
with restriction question.

00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:31.824
In how many ways can the letters of
the word banking be arranged such

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:34.135
that the two ends are always together?

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:42.535
Options A seven 20 B 360 C one 20
D two 40 understand the question

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:43.839
before moving to explanation.

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:44.925
Okay.

00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:49.485
For our final example, we're arranging
the letters of banking, which has

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:52.064
seven letters with two identical ends.

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:56.145
The restriction is that the
two ends must always together.

00:10:56.595 --> 00:11:01.305
The trick here is to treat the items
that must stay together as a single unit.

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:04.275
So let's bundle NNN into one block.

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.314
Now what are we arranging?

00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:15.015
We have B-A-K-I-G and our new block, nnn,
that makes six effective items to arrange.

00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:19.185
The number of ways to arrange
these six distinct items is six

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:21.435
factorial, which is seven 20.

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:25.275
Now we must consider the
arrangements inside our block.

00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:26.810
The block is NN.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.420
Since both letters are identical,
there is only one way to arrange them.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.280
NN is just NN.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:39.460
So the final calculation is seven 20
multiplied by one, which is seven 20.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.190
The correct answer is a seven 20.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.210
Thank you.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.860
See you in the next lecture.
