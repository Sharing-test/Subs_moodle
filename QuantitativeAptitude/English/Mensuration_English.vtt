00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.630
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on Mensuration.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.830
We are about to make the
complicated, ridiculously clear on

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.510
this concept with this tutorial.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:13.665
Concept explanation.

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:17.085
So what exactly is mensuration my friend?

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.655
Well, it's a super important
branch of mathematics.

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:25.785
Think of it as the ultimate guide to
measuring all sorts of geometric figures.

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.545
We are talking about
parameters like length.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.345
Parameter area, surface area, and volume.

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:37.894
Basically, it's all about calculating
the size, quantity and dimensions of

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:43.265
different shapes, whether it's a flat,
two dimensional or 2D as we like to call

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:48.010
it, figure like a drawing on paper where
we mostly measure parameter and area.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.485
Or a solid three dimensional,
that's 3D for you.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:57.675
Figure like a real life object where
we dive into surface area and volume.

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.995
It's all about understanding
the space objects occupy and

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:03.464
where their boundaries lie.

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:04.545
Simple, right?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.310
Real world relevance.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.390
Now, why should you even bother
with mensuration, especially

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.950
for something like your exam?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
Well, let me tell you, it's not just
for mathematicians in ivory towers.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.750
Mensuration is incredibly practical.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.350
For instance, it helps our
friends at the bank immensely.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.780
They use it for property valuation,
calculating areas of figuring out how much

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.545
space they need for a new bank branch.

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:37.215
It's fantastic for quick estimations
in various financial planning

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:40.755
scenarios, especially when
physical assets are involved.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:43.455
Let's break down where it comes in handy.

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.735
First off, property valuation.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:50.865
Imagine assessing land and building areas
to approve those big loan applications.

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:55.335
Then there's space management,
optimizing office layouts and brand

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:57.854
spaces, so everything fits just right.

00:01:58.035 --> 00:01:59.235
No wasted space.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:03.825
For inventory management, it's about
calculating storage space for all

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.715
those important physical documents.

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:08.565
And don't forget financial projections.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:13.185
Estimating material costs for big
infrastructure projects that needs

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.885
mensuration, even for risk assessment.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:19.755
Analyzing the dimensions of
collateral for security purposes.

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.245
And finally, data visualization.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:27.105
Yes, you heard me representing
financial data using geometric shapes.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.845
See, it's everywhere.

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:35.325
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns in your exam.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:39.345
Mensuration questions usually
zoom in on a few specific types.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:44.625
Roughly 40% of the questions often
revolve around the area and parameter

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:49.725
of 2D shapes, think squares,
rectangles, circles, and triangles.

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.305
These are your bread and
butter, so know them well.

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:57.525
Another 30% are about volume
and surface area of 3D shapes.

00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:02.895
Here we are talking about cubes,
cuboids, cylinders, cones, and spheres.

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.445
Get ready to think in three dimensions.

00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:09.495
About 15% of the questions might
challenge you with combined

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:10.730
shapes or compound figures.

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:14.835
This is where you combine simple
shapes to make complex ones.

00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:19.035
Then around 10% are about
problems involving ratios and

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.475
proportions in menstruation.

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:24.465
This is when knowing your ratios
really pays off, and a smaller

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:29.445
chunk, about 5% will be problems
on costing based on area or volume.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:33.585
Calculating costs for paint
tiles or construction material.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.225
Basically, don't underestimate these.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.150
They can be tricky.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.050
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.440
All right, my friends, time
for the weapon arsenal.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.550
The formulas.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.530
No, no, don't look scared.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.810
They're your best friends in menstruation.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.290
2D shapes for a rectangle area is
simply length multiplied by breath.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.460
Parameter is two multiplied
by length plus breadth.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.090
Easy.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.570
PZ.

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:06.765
Forest square area is side
multiplied by side or side squared.

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:10.364
Side two parameter is
four multiplied by side.

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:11.774
Four equal sides.

00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:16.575
Remember, forest, a circle
area is pi r squared.

00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.844
Pi r squared sounds like a delicious pie.

00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:24.615
Doesn't right Circumference, which is
just the parameter of a circle, is two

00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:31.545
by R. For a general triangle area is half
multiplied by base, multiplied by height.

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:37.515
Remember that half and specifically
for an equilateral triangle where all

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:42.405
sides are equal, area is route three
by four, multiplied by site squared.

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:46.725
Site two height is route three
by two, multiplied by side.

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.635
These two are special, so
give them extra attention.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.960
3D shapes.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.090
Moving on to us solid friends.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.190
The 3D shapes for a OID
volume is length multiplied by

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.750
breadth, multiplied by height.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.310
Think of a shoebox.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.680
Total surface area is two
multiplied by LB plus BH plus hl.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.330
All the face my friend.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:12.645
For a cube, volume is site cubed.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:14.985
Site three, all sides are equal.

00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:19.395
Remember, total surface area is
six multiplied by site squared.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:20.895
Six, multiplied by site.

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:21.195
Two.

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:24.555
Six identical faces for a cylinder.

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.159
Volume is pi r squared edge.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.740
Imagine a round pillar or a water tank.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.020
Curved surface area is two pi r Edge,
just the round part, no top or bottom.

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.120
Total surface area is two pi R
into edge plus R. This includes

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.380
the top and bottom circles.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.419
Two for a cone volume is one
third into pi R squared edge.

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:47.094
Yes.

00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:51.505
One third of a cylinder with the same
base and height curved surface area

00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:54.594
is PI rl, where L is the slant height.

00:05:54.835 --> 00:06:00.174
And remember, L itself is found using
Pythagoras root at squared plus R squared.

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:01.135
Smart, isn't it?

00:06:01.674 --> 00:06:07.284
Total surface area is pi R into L plus R,
the curved part plus the circular base.

00:06:07.614 --> 00:06:11.784
Finally, for a sphere, volume
is four by three into pi.

00:06:11.784 --> 00:06:12.474
Our cube.

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.465
Perfect ball round in every direction.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:18.105
Surface area is four pi r squared.

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:22.305
That's the entire outer skin
of the ball methods of solving.

00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:25.875
Now, how do we tackle these
problems, my friends, there are a

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:27.585
few smart ways to approach them.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:31.815
First, direct application of
formulas for standard shapes.

00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:32.925
It's straightforward.

00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:36.465
Just identify the dimensions
given and plug them directly

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:37.755
into the relevant formula.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.135
No rocket science here.

00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:41.865
Second, breaking down complex shapes.

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:45.235
Sometimes you'll encounter
figures that look intimidating.

00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:47.665
Don't panic for composite figures.

00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:50.605
Simply divide them into
simpler standard shapes.

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:55.375
For example, a how shape can be broken
down into a rectangle and a triangle.

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:59.755
Calculate the area or volume of each
part separately, and then sum them up.

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:02.365
It's like solving a puzzle piece by piece.

00:07:02.784 --> 00:07:05.305
Next, using ratios and proportions.

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:09.745
When dimensions are given in ratios,
let's say two is to three, represent

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:14.485
them with a variable like two x three
x. Then use these in your formulas.

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:18.805
This method is especially useful when
you're comparing two similar shapes.

00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:21.235
Ratios can make your life so much easier.

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:23.375
Then there's unit conversion.

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:29.015
This is crucial always, and I mean, always
ensure all your dimensions are in the same

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:31.174
units before you start crunching numbers.

00:07:31.474 --> 00:07:34.955
If one is in centimeters and the
other in meters, convert them.

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:37.625
Otherwise, your answer
will be completely off.

00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:40.864
Sometimes you might need
to try working backwards.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:45.424
If the area or volume is already given
and you need to find a missing dimension,

00:07:45.544 --> 00:07:47.195
just use the formula in reverse.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.160
Apply a little bit of
algebraic manipulation and

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.630
boom, you found your unknown.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.810
And don't forget the
Evergreen Pythagorean Theorem.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.520
This hero often comes to the rescue in
both 2D and 3D mensuration problems.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.120
It's perfect for finding missing
side lengths, especially in right

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.170
angle triangles, or for calculating
slant heights in cones and pyramids.

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:09.905
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:08:10.085 --> 00:08:12.275
Who doesn't love a good shortcut?

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:12.755
Right?

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:16.475
Here are some smart
techniques to ace mensuration.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:21.605
First memorize key pie values
for calculations involving

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.165
circles, cylinders, cones.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:24.915
And spheres.

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:31.035
Knowing common multiples of PI or knowing
when to use pi, approximately 22 7

00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:34.965
versus 3.14 can save you a lot of time.

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:39.675
Sometimes 22 by seven works
wonders with cancellations.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.600
Next, consider the ratio
method for similar shapes.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.010
This is a gem if you have
two similar shapes, like two

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.020
similar triangles or spheres.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.220
Their dimensions, areas,
and volumes follow specific,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.600
predictable relationships.

00:08:55.965 --> 00:09:00.975
For example, if the ratio of their
corresponding sites is A is two B, then

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:05.835
the ratio of their areas will be a square
is two B square and the ratio of their

00:09:05.835 --> 00:09:08.205
volumes will be a cube is two B cube.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:11.595
This can drastically cut
down your calculation time.

00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:17.025
Practice mental calculation for simple
figures for squares and rectangles

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.275
with nice round integer sites.

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:23.055
Try to quickly calculate area
and perimeter in your head.

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:27.205
The more you practice, the faster
you get For multiple choice

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:29.245
questions, try approximation.

00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:34.375
If the options are quite far apart, you
don't always need to be super precise.

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:40.105
Approximating values like Route Three,
approximately 1.732 can help you.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.850
Quickly zero in on the closest
correct answer without getting

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.860
bogged down in lengthy calculations.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.120
Always try visualization
for those complex problems.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.110
Try to visualize the shape in
your mind or how it transforms.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.579
Drawing a rough sketch can often
clarify the problem dramatically and

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:00.350
help you choose the right formula.

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:05.185
It's like building a mental
blueprint and finally check units.

00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:08.245
This is a simple but
super effective technique.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:12.895
Always double check the units mentioned
in the question and make sure your final

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:15.025
answer is expressed in the correct unit.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:19.944
This helps you avoid silly errors and
ensures you've actually calculated what

00:10:19.944 --> 00:10:22.795
was asked, whether it's area or volume.

00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:26.189
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:27.780
All right, my friends.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.330
Let's talk about where
most people stumble.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.100
Knowing these pitfalls can save
you from making them a big one

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.110
is confusing area and perimeter.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.840
So many friends mix up the formulas.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.150
Remember, area is the space inside a
2D shape, like the carpet on a floor.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.870
While perimeter is the distance
around the boundary of a 2D

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.610
shape, like the skirting board.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.189
Different concepts, different formulas.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.209
Another common graph is
mixing 2D and 3D formulas.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.550
Please for the love of numbers, don't
apply 2D area formulas to 3D shapes

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.160
for volume calculations or vice versa.

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:09.150
You wouldn't use a measuring tape for
height to measure your weight, would you?

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.310
Then there's incorrect units.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.959
Oh, this is a classic, not converting
all dimensions to the same unit

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:19.439
before calculation is a short,
short way to get the wrong answer.

00:11:19.765 --> 00:11:23.365
Centimeters and meters in the
same problem, convert them first.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:26.515
Sometimes it's about
using incorrect pie value.

00:11:26.815 --> 00:11:32.065
Knowing whether to use 3.14 or 22
by seven can make a huge difference.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:36.565
Sometimes 22 by seven is a blessing
because of easy cancellations.

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:38.845
Other times 3.14 is better.

00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:39.595
Choose wise.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.930
And of course, errors in formulary
call misremembering or transposing

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.200
parts of a formula, especially
for complex surface area.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.720
Formulas of 3D shapes is very common.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.530
Practice.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.780
Practice to etch them into your brain.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.630
Finally, overlooking hidden information.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.510
Word problems, love to
hide crucial details.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.590
Things like open from top for
surface area calculations can

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.180
completely change your approach.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.310
Read the question carefully, my friend.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.750
Read it like a detective.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.490
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.990
Let's quickly summarize menstruation
using our W Edge framework.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.700
So what is it?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.850
It's the measurement of
geometric figures, dimensions,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.550
area, surface area, and volume.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.690
Simple as that.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.940
And why do we learn it To quantify
space, size, and capacity of

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.965
objects in real world applications.

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:33.045
Very practical.

00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:34.954
When is it applied?

00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:40.025
Whenever you're dealing with physical
space, construction, design and resource

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:44.165
allocation, basically anywhere you
need to measure something physical.

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:45.635
Where is it used?

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:51.454
Everywhere in engineering, architecture,
finance, manufacturing, and yes.

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:54.000
Even in your daily life, who uses it?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.040
Engineers, architects, designers,
carpenters, bankers, and truly anyone

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.930
who deals with physical dimensions.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.949
You too, my friend, for your
exam And how is it Done?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.599
By using specific mathematical
formulas and principles based on the

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:14.530
shapes properties, it's all about the
right formula for the right shape.

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:16.755
Fully worked out examples.

00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:20.895
All right, my friends, let's get
our hands dirty with some examples.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:24.494
Practical application is the
best way to learn, right?

00:13:24.945 --> 00:13:26.805
Example, one question.

00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:31.905
The length of a rectangle is 12 centimeter
and its breadth is eight centimeter.

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:35.115
What is the area of the rectangle options?

00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:37.935
A 20 centimeter square B.

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:43.845
40 centimeter square C. 96 centimeter
square D. A hundred centimeter square.

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.995
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.969
Step-by-step solution.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.040
First, understand the goal.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.069
The question asks for
the area of a rectangle.

00:13:54.219 --> 00:13:55.120
Straightforward.

00:13:55.479 --> 00:14:01.089
Next, recall the formula, the area of a
rectangle is given by the formula area

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.875
equals length multiplied by breadth.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.820
Then identify given values.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.610
Length L equals 12 centimeter
breadth B equals eight centimeter.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.980
Now substitute values into
formula area equals 12 centimeter

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.630
multiplied by eight centimeter.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:24.960
Finally, calculate the result area
equals 96 centimeters square, so the

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.200
correct answer is C 96 centimeter square.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.365
Easy marks my friend.

00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:31.845
Example two question.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:36.885
A cylindrical tank has a radius of
seven meters and a height of 10 meters.

00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:44.955
What is the volume of the tank used by
equals 22 by seven options, A 154 M cube

00:14:45.195 --> 00:14:52.335
B 220 M Cube C 1,540 MCU D 2,200 mcu.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.425
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:55.815 --> 00:14:57.345
Step-by-step solution.

00:14:57.615 --> 00:14:59.265
First, understand the goal.

00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:04.155
The question asks For the volume of a
cylindrical tank, think big water tank.

00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:06.285
Next, recall the formula.

00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:09.225
The volume of a cylinder
is given by the formula.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.105
Volume equals by r square edge.

00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:14.535
Then identify given values.

00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:17.325
Radius are equal seven meters.

00:15:17.565 --> 00:15:19.755
Height edge equals 10 meters.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.760
And they've even given us by
equals 22 by seven, so convenient.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:31.210
Now, substitute values into formula
volume equals 22 by seven, multiplied

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.790
by seven square multiplied by 10.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:34.510
Time.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.980
To simplify the calculation
volume equals 22 by seven,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.815
multiplied by 49 multiplied by 10.

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:44.185
Now perform multiplication.

00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:49.045
Volume equals 22, multiplied
by seven, multiplied by 10.

00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:51.204
See how that seven cancels out?

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:51.835
Smart.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:57.355
Finally, calculate the result
volume equals 154 multiplied

00:15:57.355 --> 00:16:00.835
by 10 equals 1,540 mq.

00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:05.635
So the correct answer is C 1,540 M cube.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.194
Not too bad, right?

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:09.395
Example three question.

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:14.045
If the site of a square is
increased by 20%, by what percentage

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:16.415
does its area increase options?

00:16:16.655 --> 00:16:17.915
A 20%.

00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:21.155
B 40%, C 44%.

00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:25.500
D 120% understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.755
Step-by-step solution.

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.645
First, understand the goal.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:33.395
We need to find the percentage
increase in the area of a square

00:16:33.545 --> 00:16:35.645
when its site gets a 20% bump.

00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:39.365
A smart trick here is to
assume an initial side length.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.725
Let's take the original side
of the square to be 10 units.

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:43.505
Why 10?

00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:47.525
Because working with percentages
on 10 or a hundred makes life easy.

00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:50.375
Next, calculate original area.

00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:54.814
Original area equals side squared
equals a hundred square units

00:16:54.995 --> 00:16:56.824
perfect for percentage comparisons.

00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:58.954
Now calculate new side length.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:05.855
A 20% increase on 10 units is 10
plus 0.20 multiplied by 10 equals

00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:08.045
10 plus two equals 12 units.

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:08.885
Simple math.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.069
Then calculate new area.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:15.420
New area equals side squared
equals 1 44 square units.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.470
See the magic happening Next,
calculate the increase in area.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.920
Increase equals new area, minus original
area equals 144 minus a hundred.

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:30.525
Equals 44 square units finally,
calculate percentage increase.

00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:34.605
Percentage increase equals
increase upon original area

00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:36.195
multiplied by a hundred percent.

00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:40.725
Substitute and calculate
percentage increase equals 44

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:44.355
by a hundred, multiplied by
a hundred percent equals 44%.

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:53.265
So the correct answer is C 44% C, not 20%
or 40%, but 44% tricky, but we got it.

00:17:53.784 --> 00:17:54.325
Thank you.

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:55.855
See you in the next lecture.
