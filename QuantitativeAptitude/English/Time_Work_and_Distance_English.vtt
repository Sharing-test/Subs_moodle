00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on time, work, and Distance.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.250
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
Explanation, my dear
friends, time and work.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.650
These are those tricky topics that deal
with problems related to how long it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.660
takes for individuals or a whole gang
of them to finish a particular task.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.805
The fundamental mantra, the core idea
behind all this is crystal clear.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.795
The amount of work you get done
is directly proportional to the

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:37.815
time you put in, and of course,
the efficiency of the worker.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.095
More efficiency, less time.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.140
Hannah.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.850
Then we have distance, speed, and time.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.830
This trio deals with the evergreen
relationship between how far an object

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.540
travels, how fast it decides to zoom,
and for how long it keeps going.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.920
These two concepts are absolutely
fundamental for understanding

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.780
so many real life scenarios.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.129
And trust me, they are frequently
tested in your competitive exams.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.750
So pay attention ya.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.215
Real world relevance for an officer.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.795
These concepts are not just for exams.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.845
You know, they are absolutely
crucial for your day-to-day, like

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.355
operational planning, whether
it's managing project deadlines or

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.545
smartly assessing staff efficiency.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:26.735
They even help in sharp logistics
analysis perhaps for optimizing travel

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:31.625
plans for those important branch visits
or ensuring smooth cash movements.

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.035
See, it's all connected.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.750
Breakdown of question types.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650
Now, based on what we've seen
in past exam patterns for your

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.220
exam, here are the recurring
question formats you'll encounter.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.280
First up, accounting for a good 30%.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.130
We have individual or group work problems.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.080
These are where individuals or groups
work together or sometimes you know,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.215
just by themselves to complete a task.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.000
Then about 20% will be pipes and
cisterns, which is essentially time and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.759
work, but with water problems involving
filling or emptying tanks using pipes.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.100
Another 20% is dedicated to boats and
streams where we deal with the speed

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.480
of boats in still water and how they
perform when going with the current

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.510
that's downstream or bravely against it.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.769
That's upstream.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:24.765
Trains get about 15% of the action.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.084
These problems involve our speeding
steel giants, crossing poles,

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.215
platforms, or even other trains.

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:35.834
Relative speed problems account
for 10%, where objects move either

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:37.815
towards or away from each other.

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:40.515
We figure out their combine speed impact.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:44.774
And finally, a small but
important 5% goes to work.

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:49.274
And wages where wages naturally
are distributed based on the work

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:51.615
done or how efficient someone was.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.075
Makes sense, right?

00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:55.025
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:55.924
All right.

00:02:56.165 --> 00:03:01.535
Time for some brain food, the essential
formulas and tricks for time and work.

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:07.234
Our first Golden rule Work equals
efficiency into time for finding total

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:09.394
work using the clever LCM method.

00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:13.445
Remember, total work equals
LCM of individual times.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.290
If A takes X days and B takes
Y days together, they'll finish

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.570
the job in a neat X into Y.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.730
Upon x plus Y saves time.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.820
And for comparing work done by different
groups, we use this powerful constant men

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.610
into today's, into us upon work equals
constant for time, speed, and distance.

00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:38.305
The Holy Trinity distance
equals speed into time.

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:42.565
From this, we derive speed
equals distance upon time, and

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.425
time equals distance upon speed.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.135
Simple, yet powerful.

00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:49.705
Average speed is never just
S one plus S two by two.

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:52.945
Remember, it's total distance
divided by total time.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.489
For conversions.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.260
The magic numbers are one kilometer
per r equals five upon 18 meter

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.269
per second, and vice versa.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.130
One meter per second equals 18 upon
five kilometer per R. Don't forget

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.420
these, they are lifesavers when
objects move in the same direction.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.269
Their relative speed equals
speed, one minus speed.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.730
Two, assuming speed, one
greater than speed two.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.810
But if they are coming towards
each other like long lost friends,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.670
their relative speed equals speed.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.870
One plus speed two.

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:24.685
Methods of solving.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:29.065
So how do we tackle these
problems, boss for time and

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.465
work first, the unitary method.

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:36.325
Here we are like supers sleuths,
calculating how much work an individual

00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:41.665
does in one unit of time, say one
day or one hour, and then bam.

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.215
We use that to figure out the grand total.

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:49.275
Then there's the LCM Method, also
known as the efficiency method.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:51.105
This is super handy.

00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:56.505
You assume the total work to be the least
common multiple of the individual times.

00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:01.125
This trick lets you find out how
many units of work each person

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.315
or pipe does per unit of time.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:04.340
That efficiency.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.745
The fraction method involves
expressing the work done by each

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:12.885
person or pipe as a fraction of
the total work per unit of time.

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:16.545
Just add these fractions to
find their combined work rate.

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.305
And finally, the percentage method.

00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:23.565
Treat total work as a cool a hundred
percent, and then calculate the

00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:25.710
personage of work done per unit of time.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.140
For time, speed, and distance.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.410
Sometimes it's just a
direct formula application.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.790
You identify what's given, what's
asked, and plug it straight into

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.410
distance equals speed into time,
or speed equals distance upon time,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.660
or time equals distance upon speed.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.450
The ratio method is quite elegant.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.220
When one variable be it distance,
speed, or time is constant, the

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.260
other two are in inverse proportion.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.880
So if distance is constant, speed
is inversely proportional to time,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.880
meaning S one upon S two equals T two.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.980
Upon T one use ratios.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.790
B Smart.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.320
The relative speed method is for when
two objects are moving, calculate

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.340
their relative speed to find the time
they take to meet or cross each other.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.010
It simplifies things greatly and always,
always use the conversion method.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.530
Convert units of speed, distance, or
time to ensure consistency before you

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.510
even think of applying those formulas.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.900
Otherwise, your answer
might just take a holiday.

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:30.705
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:35.355
Let's talk about some smart moves,
some shortcuts because who has time

00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:37.034
for long methods in an exam, huh?

00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:38.594
For time and work?

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:42.675
Negative work for outlets and
pipes and systems treat their

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:44.325
work as negative efficiency.

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:45.945
They are taking work away.

00:06:46.034 --> 00:06:49.425
So this subtract from the
total fraction of work done.

00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:53.505
If a person works for X days and
then decides to leave, classic,

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:57.495
calculate the remaining work as
one minus work done by that person.

00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.205
Work with wages.

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:04.215
Remember, wages are directly proportional
to the work done or how efficient you are.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:06.015
More work, more money.

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:11.025
Simple economics for time, speed, and
distance for meeting point problems.

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:15.525
If objects are moving towards each other,
the time to meet is simply the total

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.805
distance divided by the relative speed.

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:22.905
Crossing problems when a train
crosses a pole or a man or a tree,

00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:26.715
basically anything with negligible
length, the distance covered is

00:07:26.715 --> 00:07:28.395
just the length of the train itself.

00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:32.715
But if it's crossing platforms,
tunnels, or another train, then the

00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:34.844
distance is the sum of all their length.

00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:36.615
Don't forget that extra length.

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:37.455
It matters.

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:39.135
Boats and streams.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.305
These are fun.

00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:41.625
Speed downstream.

00:07:41.655 --> 00:07:43.425
SD equals speed of boat.

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:48.735
SB plus speed of stream SS you are
flowing with it so it's faster speed.

00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:51.015
Upstream SU equals speed of boat.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:52.875
SB minus speed of stream.

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:55.845
Ss you are fighting the
current so it's slower.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:08:00.975
And a cool trick speed of both
SB equals SD plus SU upon two.

00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:04.875
And speed of stream SS
equals SD minus SU upon two.

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:09.695
Remember these formulas, they are
gold, fixed distance, varying speed.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:14.705
If someone travels a certain distance
at speed S one, and then after Ani

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:19.445
returns at speed S two, their average
speed is not S one plus S two upon two.

00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:23.525
It's a precise to S one, S
two upon S one plus S two.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:24.695
Write it down.

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.755
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:31.745
All right, listen up, because
these are the classic traps

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.424
where friends often stumble.

00:08:34.364 --> 00:08:38.234
Four time and work first
common blunder directly.

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:40.484
Adding times are a no, no, no.

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:44.234
You can't just add individual
times to find combined time.

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:46.724
That's like adding apples and oranges.

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:52.305
Remember, work rates or efficiencies
are what you add, not the total time.

00:08:52.454 --> 00:08:52.724
Got.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.650
Ignoring units, not converting days
to hours, or vice versa when required.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.420
This is a silly mistake.

00:09:00.449 --> 00:09:01.890
Don't let it happen to you.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.599
Misinterpreting work done forgetting
that work can be thought of as

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:09.089
one unit or more practically.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:11.610
The LCM of days keep it simple.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.959
Negative efficiency for pipes,
failing to assign a negative

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:17.910
sign for pipes that empty a tank.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.469
They are the bad guys taking water
out so their work is negative.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.910
Four, time speed and
distance unit inconsistency.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.110
This is a big one, not converting
kilometer per hour to meet

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.090
up per second or vice versa.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.180
Leading to absolutely
incorrect calculations.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.460
Always, always make units consistent
First, confusing relative speeds,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.080
incorrectly adding or subtracting
speeds for same or opposite directions.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.430
Remember, same direction,
subtract opposite direction, add.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.990
Ignoring lens in train problems,
forgetting to add the length of

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.770
the platform tunnel or the other
train to the train's own length.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.839
When calculating the total distance for
crossing, this is a very common oversight.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.370
Miscalculating average speed
simply averaging speeds like

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.780
S one plus S two by two.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.300
Instead of using the correct
total distance divided by.

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:18.135
Total time formula, especially when
distances or times are unequal.

00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:22.665
Avoid the shortcut unless the distance
is the same for both legs of the journey.

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.824
WH framework summary.

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:29.385
Let's quickly summarize this whole
kahani using our WH framework.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.829
So what are we talking about here?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.270
Problems dealing with efficiency,
how work gets completed, and the

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.160
exciting movement of objects.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.750
Why are these important?

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:43.740
They are absolutely essential for
sharpening your logical reasoning,

00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:47.760
boosting your problem solving skills,
and nailing efficiency analysis.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.920
When do we apply these in scenarios
involving task completion for

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.609
smart travel planning, and for
efficient resource allocation?

00:10:56.969 --> 00:10:59.040
Where are these concepts
used in real life?

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.819
Think logistics, project
management, scheduling, and of

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:04.344
course, your competitive exams.

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:06.459
Who needs to master this?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.829
Bankers for operational efficiency,
logisticians, project managers and all

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:14.319
you ambitious competitive exam aspirants.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.790
How do we solve them?

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.890
By using specific formulas and methods
that cleverly relate work time,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.199
distance, speed, and efficiency.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.739
It's all about applying the
right tool for the right job.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.959
Fully worked out examples.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.620
Example one time and work LCM Method.

00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:33.735
Question.

00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:39.345
A can do a piece of work in 10 days
and B can do the same work in 15 days.

00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:43.095
In how many days will they complete
the work if they work together?

00:11:43.545 --> 00:11:50.355
Options a five days B, six
days, C, eight days, D 12 days.

00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:54.795
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:59.545
Step one, find the total work
using the LCM method, the

00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:01.675
time taken by A is 10 days.

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:04.345
The time taken by B is 15 days.

00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:08.095
Now the LCM of 10 and 15 is 30 units.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.815
We cleverly assume this 30
units to be our total work.

00:12:12.115 --> 00:12:15.085
Step two, calculate
individual efficiencies.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.450
Efficiency of a meaning.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.550
How much work A does in one day is
equal to total work by time taken by

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:29.150
A is equal to 30 units by 10 days is
equal to three units per day Efficiency

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:34.070
of B, how much work B does in one
day is equal to total work by time

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:40.220
taken by B is equal to 30 units by 15
days is equal to two units per day.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.780
They're a good team, huh?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.110
Step four, find the total time
taken to complete the work together.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.900
Time taken together is equal to total
work by combined efficiency is equal

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.630
to 30 units by five units per day
is equal to six days, correct answer

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.270
B, six days C. Teamwork pays off.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.949
Example two time speed and
distance train problem.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:09.510
Question A train 150 meters
long is running at a speed

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.160
of 54 kilometer per hour.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.670
How much time will it take
to cross a pole options?

00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.170
A five seconds.

00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:17.699
B. 10 seconds.

00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:19.349
C. 15 seconds.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.120
D. 20 seconds understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:25.104
Solution.

00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:29.305
Step one, understand the distance
to be covered when crossing a pole.

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:34.435
Now, when a train crosses a pole, or
a man or a tree, basically anything

00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:38.395
with negligible length, Sousa, the
distance that the train needs to cover

00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:40.464
is simply equal to its own length.

00:13:40.675 --> 00:13:46.045
So here distance equals length of
the train is equal to 150 meters.

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:50.829
Step two, convert the speed from
kilometer per hour to meter per second.

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:55.780
Our length is in meters, so naturally
the speed should be in meters per second.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.319
Emper speed equals 54 kilometer per hour.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.219
Remember, our conversion factor
one kilometer per hour is equal

00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:05.349
to five by 18 meters per second.

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:10.930
So speed in emper S is
equal to 54 into five by 80.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.079
Meter per second is
equal to three into five.

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.040
Meter per second is equal
to 15 Emper much better.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.199
Step three, use the formula.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.270
Time equals distance by speed.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.660
Time taken is equal to distance by
speed is equal to 150 meters by 15

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.390
Meter per second is equal to 10 seconds.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.470
Correct answer B. 10 seconds
quick like a bullet train.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.310
Example.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.700
Three.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.990
Boats and streams.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.860
Question.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.220
A man can row at five kilometer
per hour in still water.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.890
If the speed of the current
is one kilometer per hour,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.810
how long will he take to row?

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.439
36 kilometers upstream options A six.

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:56.680
RB seven RC eight RD nine R
understand the question before

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.930
moving to explanation solution.

00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:03.625
Step one, identify the given speeds,
speed of man and still water.

00:15:03.775 --> 00:15:06.505
SB is equal to five kilometer per hour.

00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:07.945
This is his B speed.

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:12.985
Speed of current SS is equal to one
kilometer per hour, and the distance

00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:14.905
to be covered is 36 kilometer.

00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:15.985
Step two.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.780
Calculate the upstream speed.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.689
Upstream speed SU is equal to speed of
man and Stillwater minus speed of current.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.740
Why subtract?

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.770
Because he's rowing against
the current, it slows him down.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:33.920
So SU is equal to SB minus SS is
equal to five kilometer per hour.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.910
Minus one kilometer per hour is
equal to four kilometer per hour.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.070
See, the current is pulling him back.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.845
Step three, use the formula.

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:44.115
Time equals distance by speed.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:49.485
Time taken to row 36 kilometers upstream
is equal to distance by upstream speed.

00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:54.375
Time is equal to 36 kilometers by
four kilometer per hour is equal to

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.435
nine Rs, correct answer D nine Rs.

00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:59.505
Takes a while when you are
fighting the current, huh?

00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:00.405
Thank you.

00:16:00.615 --> 00:16:01.905
See you in the next lecture.
