00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.770
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on mixtures and allegations.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
Let's unpack the mystery of
this concept without needing a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.030
PhD or a panic attack concept.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.180
Explanation, mixtures and allegations, my
dear friend, is like the secret ingredient

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.760
of quantitative aptitude, especially
crucial for your exam at its score.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
It's all about combining two or
more ingredients or quantities.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:32.585
Think of it like a chef blending
spices, but with numbers.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:37.055
These ingredients often come with
different prices or properties,

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.805
and our job is to figure
out the new mixture's value.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:47.055
The allegation part, well, that's just
a fancy word for a rule, a method that

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:52.305
helps us figure out the perfect ratio
in which to mix things or to find the

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:54.915
average value of the resulting concoction.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.485
Imagine you are at the
market trying to buy rice.

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:02.475
You have one type that's super
economical, and another that's

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.004
a bit on the pricier side.

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:08.025
If you mix them naturally,
the price of your new mixture

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:09.555
will be somewhere in between.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:14.765
Mixtures and allegations gives you
a systematic roadmap to figure out

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:19.025
the exact ratio you need to mix
them in to get that desired price.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.195
Or if you already know how much
of each you've mixed, it helps

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:25.055
you calculate the mixtures price.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.695
It's like magic, but with math.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.920
Now, broadly speaking, we've got two
main types of mixtures just like in life,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.380
that are simple and complex situations.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.990
First, we have the simple mixture.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.240
This is straightforward, like mixing
milk and water or different varieties

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.230
of pulses, directly combining
two or more different elements.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.970
No fuss, no mass.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.190
Then comes the complex mixture.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.229
This is where things get a bit
more interesting, like mixing

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.360
two already existing solutions.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.910
Imagine combining two different milk and
water solutions to create a brand new one.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.130
It's like a blend of blends.

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:09.669
The rule of allegation is
your go-to shortcut here.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.505
It's super efficient for mixture
problems because it turns what could

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:19.030
be a lengthy arithmetic nightmare
into a simple crisscross calculation.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:23.045
It's all based on the principle
of weighted average, which sounds

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:27.875
complicated, but trust me, it's just
a smart way to find ratios when you

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:33.245
know individual values and the mean
value of the mixture or vice versa.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:38.615
So if you understand what goes in
and what you want out, mixtures and

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:42.995
allegations gives you all the tools
to solve a whole range of problems

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.215
involving proportions and averages.

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:47.015
It's truly a gem.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.800
Real world relevance.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.060
Now, you might be wondering,
what does mixing rice and milk

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.980
have to do with my future goals?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.390
Aha, my friend.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.010
This concept is more relevant than
you think in the world of finance.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.750
Grasping the concepts of mixtures
and allegations helps in managing

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.640
complexity and assessing risk by
integrating various elements effectively.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.130
It's crucial for portfolio management and
optimizing investment strategies Truly.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.109
Think about it first.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.910
Portfolio diversification.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.140
Banks and investors don't put all
their eggs in one basket, right?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.970
They mix different assets, some high
risk, high return, some low risk,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.460
stable to balance, risk and return.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.380
That's mixtures in action.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.360
Second loan structuring.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.450
They combine various loan types,
perhaps short-term with long-term

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.950
fixed rate with variable to create
tailored financial products for clients,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.560
again, mixing for a specific outcome.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.450
Third, risk assessment.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.040
Banks blend different risk profiles
from various investments or clients

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.290
to evaluate their overall exposure.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.540
Are they leaning too much on one side?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.380
Mixtures?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.520
Help them figure it out.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.470
Fourth, product pricing.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.890
Determining optimal pricing for
combined financial services often

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.030
involves averaging out costs and desired
profits from different components.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.109
And finally, resource allocation
and profit optimization.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.649
Distributing funds across
different departments or projects

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.940
efficiently or mixing investment
strategies to maximize returns.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.020
It's all about intelligently
mixing and allocating resources

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.580
to get the best outcome.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.909
It's like making the
perfect chi for the economy.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.830
Breakdown of question types based
on past exam patterns for your exam.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.520
Questions from mixtures and
allegations typically appear

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.810
in these exciting formats.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.320
The most common about 40% of the time is
mixing two ingredients to form a mixture.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.850
These are your bread and butter
problems where you find the ratio in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.110
which two ingredients with different
costs or properties are mixed to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.750
get a desired mean cost or property.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.020
This is where a good old
rule of allegation shines.

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:09.845
Next, about 30% frequency we have
replacing a part of the mixture.

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:14.735
Imagine a container, you take some liquid
out, put some other liquid back in.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:18.935
The task is to find the new ratio
after this little switcheroo.

00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:21.160
It's like a liquid based hide and seek.

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:27.115
Then coming in at about 15% are
mixing more than two ingredients.

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.535
A bit more complex,
yes, but still solvable.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:34.465
You might need to apply the
allegation rule in steps like

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:36.175
solving a multi-level puzzle.

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:40.080
Following that, about 10% of
the time, you'll encounter

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.440
successive dilution problems.

00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:45.565
These are about a solution
being repeatedly diluted.

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:48.115
Remove some add water, repeat.

00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:53.335
You need to find the final concentration
after several such dilution dances.

00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:58.405
And finally, a sneaky 5%
profit and loss with mixtures.

00:05:58.885 --> 00:06:03.205
These clever questions combine our
mixture concepts with profit and loss.

00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:08.065
You might be given cost prices, selling
prices of the mixture and asked for

00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:10.255
profit percentage or the mixing ratio.

00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:13.525
It's like a double whammy,
but totally comparable.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.065
Formulas and tricks.

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:17.474
All right, my friends.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.265
Let's talk about the
weaponry in our arsenal.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:24.045
One rule off allegation,
crisscross my herd.

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:29.505
This my friend, is your brara, the
most fundamental and powerful formula.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:34.784
If you have two ingredients, one cheaper,
let's call its value C and one Dear.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.450
Call it D and you mix them to get
a mixture with a mean value M.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.570
Then the ratio of their
quantities is super simple.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.550
It's like this quantity of
cheaper by quantity of dura equals

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.710
dura price minus mean price by
mean price minus cheaper price.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.790
Visually.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.230
Imagine cheaper price.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.560
C on the left dearer
price, D on the right.

00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:00.465
Mean price is in the middle.

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.855
Now, draw lines crisscross the difference.

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:09.465
D minus M goes diagonally down
to the left, and M minus C goes

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:10.875
diagonally down to the right.

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:16.695
So the ratio of cheaper to the
other is simply D minus M is two M

00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:19.455
minus C. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:22.245
Two successive dilution formula.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:25.575
This is for those takeout
and put back in problems.

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:30.525
If a container starts with X units of
liquid, and Y units are drawn out and

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:35.355
replaced with water, and this operation
is repeated end times, then the quantity

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.845
of the original liquid left is final.

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:43.425
Quantity of original liquid equals
X into one minus Y by X raised

00:07:43.425 --> 00:07:45.495
to the par N simple, isn't it?

00:07:45.795 --> 00:07:49.919
Just remember the par n. Three
weighted average concept.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.890
This is the underlying
principle for everything.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.169
The mean value M of a mixture formed
by mixing two quantities in a ratio

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:04.260
A is two B with individual values, V
one and V two is M equals A and two V

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.349
one plus B and two V two by A plus B.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.490
This formula is essentially the
brain behind our rule of allegation.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:15.880
Now for some tricks, for
quick solving, always, always

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.979
identify the mean value first.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.890
This is your North star
for the crisscross method.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.070
Make sure your unit's
consistency is spot on.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.049
Don't mix apples and oranges.

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:28.090
I mean liters and milliliters.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.280
When dealing with milk and water
problems, focus on one component.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.880
Pick milk percentage or water
percentage, and stick to it.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.360
Consistency is key for
the rule of allegation.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.039
Visualize with Kris Kloss.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.659
Draw it out if you need to.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.875
It prevents silly mistakes.

00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:46.995
Finally practice with variations.

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:52.094
The more you practice, the more you'll see
how these core concepts apply to all sorts

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:57.074
of mixing problems, be it liquids, alloys,
or even averages of different groups.

00:08:57.344 --> 00:09:03.525
It's all the same logic, just different
flavors, methods of solving my friends.

00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:07.454
Let's explore the various routes
to conquer these mixture problems.

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:11.295
The rule of allegation crisscross method.

00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:15.795
This, as I said, is your most
effective weapon for two ingredient

00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:17.685
problems, aiming for a mean value.

00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:22.755
Step one first, put on your
detective hat and identify the

00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:24.375
components and their values.

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:28.905
Figure out the value of your cheaper
ingredient, C, your dearer ingredient,

00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:31.185
and the mean value M of the mixture.

00:09:31.484 --> 00:09:32.145
Step two.

00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:34.155
Next, set up the diagram.

00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:38.685
Imagine a blackboard, put C on
the left, D on the right, and M

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.425
right below them in the center.

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:41.415
Step three.

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:43.665
Time to calculate the differences.

00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:48.975
Subtract M from D, D minus M and
write it diagonally opposite C.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:55.215
Then subtract C from M, M minus C and
write it diagonally opposite D. Simple

00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:57.225
subtraction, no rocket science here.

00:09:57.495 --> 00:10:00.435
Step four, and finally
determine the ratio.

00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:05.025
The ratio of the quantity of the cheaper
ingredient to the dearer ingredient will

00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:08.685
be that D minus M versus M minus C value.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:09.525
Voila.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.470
Two algebraic method using equations.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.020
This method is your reliable friend.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.710
When the crisscross rule might
not directly apply, or for more

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.550
complex scenarios, like when you
have more than two ingredients,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.980
step one, define variables.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.295
Give names like X, Y to the unknown
quantities you need to find.

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:34.435
Step two, formulate equations
based on the problem.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:36.535
Write down mathematical equations.

00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:41.064
These usually represent the total
quantity and the total value or

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:42.834
amount of a specific component.

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:45.354
It's like telling a story with numbers.

00:10:45.594 --> 00:10:47.724
Step three, solve the equations.

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:51.984
Then just use your good old
algebraic skills, substitution,

00:10:52.045 --> 00:10:55.500
elimination, whatever works best
to find those unknown values.

00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:58.344
Three successive dilution method.

00:10:58.675 --> 00:11:01.855
This one is tailor made for
problems where liquid is

00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:04.135
repeatedly drawn out and replaced.

00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:08.214
Step one, identify initial
quantity and amount removed.

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:12.235
What was the original amount
X and how much was taken out

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.305
and replaced Y each time?

00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:17.515
Step two, identify the
number of operations.

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:21.714
How many times was this draw
and replace drama repeated n.

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:23.969
Step three, apply the formula.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.880
Just plug these values
into a special formula.

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:32.310
Final quantity of original liquid
equals X into one minus Y by x.

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:34.709
Whole race to n. Done and dusted.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.740
Four weighted average method.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.360
This is super handy when you already
know the individual values and their

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.220
quantities or ratios, and you just need to
find the overall average of the mixture.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.030
Step one, identify individual
values and their weights.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.560
What's the value of each component,
V one, V two, et cetera, and

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.270
how much of each are you mixing
quantities or ratios a, B, et cetera?

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.240
Step two, apply the weighted average
formula, calculate the mean value M

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:11.210
using M equals A into V one plus B
into V two plus, et cetera, divided

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.550
by A plus, B plus, et cetera.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.760
It's like finding the average
score in a class where some

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.540
subjects have more weight.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.045
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:12:21.314 --> 00:12:22.455
All right, my friends.

00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:26.595
Let's talk about some smart moves
to save precious time in your exam.

00:12:26.835 --> 00:12:29.835
First up, the crisscross
rule is your best friend.

00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:30.765
Seriously.

00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:33.975
For most mixture problems
with two components and a mean

00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:35.955
value, this method is lightning.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.805
Fast master it and you'll thank me later.

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.925
Next work with ratios, not
absolute values initially.

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:45.775
Often problems, just ask for ratios.

00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:47.275
Solve for those first.

00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:50.455
Don't get tangled up in big
numbers if you don't have to.

00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:53.605
For percentage problems,
focus on one component.

00:12:53.845 --> 00:12:57.385
If it's milk and water, just drag
the milk percentage throughout.

00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:59.275
Consistency my deal.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.060
Consistency.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.350
For successive dilution, try
visualizing successive dilution

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.600
instead of just jumping to the formula.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.430
Think about the fraction remaining.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.690
If one fourth is removed, three
fourth remains after end steps.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.820
It's three by four whole race to end.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.010
This often makes it click faster.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.390
Remember, the average concept for
mixtures is your core understanding.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.690
A mixture's mean value is
just a weighted average.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.880
If you know quantities and values, you can
find the mean or vice versa in a Jiffy.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.550
Don't forget to eliminate options
in multiple choice questions.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:38.140
A mixture's mean price must always
fall between the individual prices.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.620
If an option is outside this
range, ditch it immediately.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.930
And finally, practice mental math.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.340
Many of these problems involve simple
calculations, sharpen your mental

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.150
arithmetic, and you'll cut down on
calculation times significantly.

00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:54.125
It's like doing pushups for your brain.

00:13:55.395 --> 00:13:58.455
Common mistakes and
misconceptions, my friends.

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:02.565
Let's talk about the pitfalls, the
little traps where many friends stumble.

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:04.455
Be aware, be prepared.

00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:08.565
A very common error is incorrectly
identifying mean value.

00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:10.305
People confuse the mixture's.

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:15.580
Average M with one of the ingredients
values, C or D. Remember M is

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.470
always the final mixture's value.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.660
Then there's swapping differences.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.340
In crisscross, you put D minus M
where M minus C should be, and vice

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.740
versa leading to an inverted ratio.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.510
Practice makes perfect here.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.070
Another classic is.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.480
Incorrect units mixing liters with
milliliters or prices per kg with prices

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.550
per gram without converting first.

00:14:37.819 --> 00:14:41.000
It's like speaking two different
languages in one sentence.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.410
Also, please, my friends don't go
applying allegation rule blindly.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.500
It's primarily for two
ingredients, forming a third.

00:14:48.775 --> 00:14:53.305
For more than two, you need to break it
down or for purely raise your problems.

00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:55.765
Without a mean value,
it won't work directly.

00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:59.365
Of course, simple arithmetic
errors can derail our efforts.

00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:03.295
A small subtraction or division
mystique can mess up everything.

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:06.925
Double check your calculations,
especially under exam pressure.

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:10.845
Many friends also fall into
misinterpreting successive dilution.

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:14.775
They forget that the original
liquid decreases with each step and

00:15:14.775 --> 00:15:16.485
don't apply the formula correctly.

00:15:16.755 --> 00:15:19.635
It's a continuous dilution,
not a one-time thing.

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.975
And finally, ignoring context.

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:25.995
Not reading the problem carefully
can lead to missing crucial details

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:29.955
like profit loss conditions or
specific mixing scenarios, which

00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:31.605
can change your entire approach.

00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:33.225
Read carefully, my friends.

00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:34.245
Read carefully.

00:15:34.605 --> 00:15:36.495
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:41.380
Let's quickly recap this fantastic
concept using our W Edge framework.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.620
So what exactly is
mixtures and allegations?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.880
It's the process of combining
substances or quantities and then

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.660
figuring out their proportions or the
mean value of the resulting blend.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.000
And why is it important for us?

00:15:55.209 --> 00:16:00.010
Because it's essential for solving
problems involving ratios, proportions,

00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:04.545
and averages in various contexts,
especially in your competitive exams.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:06.880
Now, when do we use it?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.739
We apply it when two or more items
with different values are mixed to

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:16.239
form a new mixture, or when a part
of an existing mixture is removed

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.920
and replaced with something else.

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:20.109
And where will you find these problems?

00:16:20.349 --> 00:16:24.670
In the quantitative aptitude sections
of competitive exams, of course, but

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.500
also in real world scenarios like
finance, chemistry, and manufacturing.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.670
It's everywhere.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.069
Who benefits from understanding this?

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.000
My friends, preparing for government
exams, financial analysts,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.840
chemists, and really anyone who
deals with proportional mixing.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.450
Finally, how do we solve these problems?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.160
We use the brilliant rule of
allegation, orric equations, or our

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.260
trustee successive dilution formulas.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.880
It's like having a multi-tool for
numbers fully worked out examples.

00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:55.535
All right.

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:58.715
My friends theory is good,
but practice is divine.

00:16:58.925 --> 00:17:01.415
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:17:01.595 --> 00:17:04.295
Example one, mixing two varieties.

00:17:04.535 --> 00:17:09.935
Question a shopkeeper mixes two varieties
of rice, one costing rupees, 60 rupees per

00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:12.875
kg, and another costing 80 rupees per kg.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.360
In what ratio should he mix
them so that the mixture costs

00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:19.325
rupees, 75 rupees per kg? Options?

00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:25.569
A one is to three B, three is to one
C. Two is to 3D, three is to two.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.800
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.820
Step one.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.940
First things first, let's
identify our values.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.060
The cost of the cheaper rice RC is Rupees.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.310
60 Rupees per kg. The cost of the Dear
Rice are D is Rupees, 80 rupees per

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.070
kg, and the mean price of our mixture.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.855
M, that's Rupees, 75 rupees per
kg. Step two, time to apply.

00:17:49.855 --> 00:17:52.465
The rule of allegation
are crisscross method.

00:17:52.794 --> 00:17:56.215
Imagine 60 rupees on the
left, 80 rupees on the right.

00:17:56.455 --> 00:17:59.034
Our mean 75 rupees sits in the middle.

00:17:59.185 --> 00:18:02.665
Now we calculate the
differences from the dira price.

00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:04.345
Subtract the mean rupees.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.075
80 minus rupees, 75 equals five.

00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:10.135
This five goes diagonally
opposite the cheaper price.

00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:13.275
From the mean price,
subtract the cheaper price.

00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:16.995
Rupe 75 minus Rupe 60 equals 15.

00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:20.535
This 15 goes diagonally
opposite the deer price.

00:18:20.715 --> 00:18:21.495
Step three.

00:18:21.675 --> 00:18:27.225
So our ratio of the quantity of cheaper
rice to deer rice is simply five is to 15.

00:18:27.469 --> 00:18:28.189
Step four.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:30.320
Let's simplify this ratio, my friend.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.139
Both five and 15 are divisible by five.

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:38.209
Five divided by five equals one
15 divided by five equals three.

00:18:38.449 --> 00:18:41.209
So the simplified ratio
is one is to three.

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:44.000
The correct answer is a, one is to three.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.415
It's like magic, isn't it?

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:49.325
Example two successive dilution question.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:53.315
A container contains 50 liters
of milk from this container.

00:18:53.435 --> 00:18:56.615
Five liters of milk is taken
out and replaced by water.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.255
This process is repeated two more times.

00:18:59.435 --> 00:19:02.225
How much milk is now in
the container options?

00:19:02.465 --> 00:19:08.795
A 36.45 liters B 38.5
liters, C 40.5 liters.

00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:14.465
D 42.875 liters understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.419
Solution.

00:19:15.629 --> 00:19:20.250
Step one, let's identify our initial
conditions for this dilution drama.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.760
Initial quantity of milk RX is 50 liters.

00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:26.399
The amount taken out
and replaced each time.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.169
Our vibe is five liters.

00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:31.860
The number of times this process
is repeated and is crucial.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.540
It's one initial process plus two
more times, so that's a total of

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.190
one plus two equals three times.

00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.080
Don't fall for that trick.

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:40.740
Step two.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.129
Now we apply our trustee
successive dilution formula.

00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:49.169
Final quantity of original liquid
equals X into one minus Y upon X

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.389
race to n plugging in our values.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.580
Final milk equals 50 into one
minus five upon 50 cube first.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.740
Simplify that fraction inside the bracket.

00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:00.840
Five upon 50 is just one 10th.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.409
Final milk equals 50 into
one minus one upon 10 cube.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.540
Now subtract inside the bracket.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.210
One minus one upon 10 is nine-tenths.

00:20:10.389 --> 00:20:13.600
Final milk equals 50
into nine tenths cube.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.820
Next cube, that fraction nine by 10
cubed means nine multiplied by nine,

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.870
multiplied by nine divided by 10,
multiplied by 10, multiplied by 10,

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:29.260
which is 7 29 upon thousand final milk
equals 50 into 7 29 upon thousand.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.459
Convert the fraction to a decimal
for easier multiplication.

00:20:32.639 --> 00:20:35.760
7 29 upon thousand is 0.729.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.100
Final milk equals 50 into 0.729
and finally multiply it out.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.220
Final milk equals 36.45 liters.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.439
The correct answer is a 36.45
liters C. It's just a formula.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:50.960
Example three.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.590
Mixing three ingredients,
advanced question three.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.210
Types of sugar with prices rupees
10 per kg, rupees 15 per kg and

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.159
rupees 20 per kg are mixed in.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.080
The ratio one is to twist to three.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:09.139
What is the average price of the mixture
per kg options A. Rupees 16.6 per kg.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:17.120
B Rupe 17.5 per kg. C. Rupe 18.5 per
kg. D. Rupe 19.5 per kg. Understand the

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.250
question before moving to explanation.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.129
Solution.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.760
Step one, let's list our
ingredients, their individual

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.679
values and their mixing ratios.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.370
Sugar one, price Rupees
10 per kg. Ratio one.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.300
Sugar, two.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.179
Price Rupees 15 per kg. Ratios two.

00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:33.810
Sugar.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.139
Three.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.010
Price Rupees.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.510
20 per kg. Ratio three.

00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:37.725
Step two.

00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:40.034
Now, we apply the
weighted average concept.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:43.605
This is perfect when you have
multiple items with different weights.

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:47.115
Here ratios contributing
to an average mean price.

00:21:47.145 --> 00:21:52.095
M equals sum of ratio multiplied
by price, divided by sum of ratios.

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:53.625
Let's plug in the numbers.

00:21:53.844 --> 00:21:59.034
M equals one into 10 plus two into
15, plus three into 20 divided

00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:00.594
by one plus two plus three.

00:22:00.745 --> 00:22:03.264
First, multiply each ratio by its price.

00:22:03.504 --> 00:22:09.324
One into 10 equals 10, two into
15 equals 33 into 20 equals 60.

00:22:09.475 --> 00:22:13.824
Now some of these products, 10
plus 30 plus 60, equals a hundred.

00:22:14.004 --> 00:22:19.675
Next sum the ratios one plus two plus
three equals six, so m equals a hundred

00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:21.409
upon six, performing the division.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.209
M equals 16.666.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.139
Rounding it.

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:31.290
We get approximately Rupe 16.6 per
kg. The correct answer is a Rupe 16.6

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.429
per kg. It's just like finding your
average marks in school, but with sugar.

00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:36.240
Thank you.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.649
See you in the next lecture.
