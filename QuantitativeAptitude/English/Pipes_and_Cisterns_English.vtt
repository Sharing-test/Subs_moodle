00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.650
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on pipes and cisterns.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.170
We are about to make the complicated,
ridiculously clear on this concept

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.270
with this tutorial pipes and
cisterns is a topic in quantitative

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.010
aptitude that deals with the rate.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.580
Pipes fill or empty a tank or
astern, as we sometimes call it.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.320
It's an extension of time and
work Pipes are workers, and the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.720
tank's capacity is the total work.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.030
Filling pipes do positive work.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.210
Emptying pipes or leaks do negative work.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.385
The core idea is to combine
rates to find the total time.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.140
Real world relevance, and this is
very relevant in the real world.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.870
It helps optimize resource management.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.970
Think about water management.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.170
Calculating time to fill
reservoirs in manufacturing.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.580
Estimating time to fill liquid
tanks for construction planning.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.450
Water supply.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:04.735
In logistics, it's managing fluid
transfer even in your everyday life.

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:09.655
With home plumbing, it's all about
resource allocation and optimizing

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:11.845
flow rates for various operations.

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:16.585
Breakdown of question types
based on past patterns For your

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:18.065
exam, here's what you'll see.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.669
35% of questions are about pipes working
simultaneously either filling or emptying.

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:28.869
20% have pipes working,
alternately taking turns.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.410
Another 20% involve those pesky leaks.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.020
15% are based on efficiency or
rate, and 10% deal with partial

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.820
filling or emptying scenarios.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:45.185
Formulas plus tricks, formulas,
time work in one unit of time.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:51.455
A pipe filling a tank in XRS has a rate
of one by X per R. An emptying pipe

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:57.815
emptying in yrs has a rate of minus one
by Y per R. For combined work filling

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:04.979
pipes A, x and BY have a rate of one
by x plus one by Y. Time is XY by X

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.800
plus Y for combined fill and empty.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:13.799
The rate is one by X minus one
by y. Time is XY by Y minus x.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.470
If Y is greater than X. Remember, the
efficiency concept rate is inverse to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.140
time, double efficiency half the time.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.649
And the best trick the Lium method assumed
tank capacity is the LCM of the times.

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.240
It avoids fractions.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
Methods of solving how to
solve these, you have options.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.180
The unitary method uses fractions,
find work per unit time, combine them,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.190
and the reciprocal is your answer.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.100
The LCM method is the smarter approach.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.070
Take LCM of times as total capacity.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.080
Find individual efficiencies, which
are units per r, get net efficiency

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.140
and divide capacity by it much faster.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.360
There's also a percentage method.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.545
Treat the tank as a hundred percent.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:05.614
Find the percentage filled per r, combine
them and divide a hundred percent by the

00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:08.704
net rate shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:13.325
Some smart techniques always treat
negative work for leaks as an

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:15.515
emptying pipe, subtract its rate.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.225
Use LCM for efficiency.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.910
It's faster for multiple
pipes for partial work.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.510
Calculate its contribution and
subtract it from the total.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
Maintain a remaining work focus
in staged problems and visualizing

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.290
flow helps with complex scenarios,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
Now avoid these common traps,
confusing, filling and emptying rates.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.150
Forgetting to subtract for leaks.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.110
Incorrect.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.510
LCM application, messing up efficiencies,
ignoring units, mixing as and

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.980
minutes assuming constant rate, not
noting when pipes are turned off.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.425
On the classic blunder is direct
addition or subtraction of times,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.305
rates are added, not times and
misinterpreting time to empty.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.660
A negative network means the tank
empties, WH framework summary.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.230
So to summarize, what is this A concept on
rates of pipes filling or emptying a tank.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.200
Why learn it to find the total time taken?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.350
When is it applied in
problems with fluid flow?

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.830
Where is it used in your
exam and in water management?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.850
Who needs it?

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.160
You, my friend and engineers.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.420
And how do we solve?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.140
By calculating individual rates
and finding the net rate of

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.660
work fully worked out examples.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.880
Example one question.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.310
Pipe A can fill a tank in 10 hours
and pipe B can fill it in 15 hours.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.570
If both pipes are open simultaneously,
how much time will they take

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.400
to fill the tank options?

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.390
A five Rs B, six Rs C 7.5 Rs D 12.5
s. Understand the question before

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.640
moving to explanation solution.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.640
Step one is to understand
the individual rates.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.400
Pipe A fills one by 10 of the tank
in one R by B fills one by 15 of the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.710
tank In one R. Step two, we calculate
that combined rate when both are open.

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:14.830
The combined rate is one
by 10 plus one by 15.

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.469
The LCM of 10 and 15 is 30, so we
get three by 30 plus two by 30,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.020
which is five by 30 or one by six.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.750
Step three is to determine total time.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.349
If they fill one by six of the
tank in one R, they will fill

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.120
the entire tank in six Rs.

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.110
The correct answer is B six
R. Example two question.

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.570
A tap can fill a tank in eight Rs.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.170
There is a leak in the bottom of
the tank, which can empty the tank

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.599
in 12 s. If the tap is opened.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.070
How much time will it take to fill the
tank with the leak present options?

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.770
A 20 Rs B 24 Rs.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.969
C four Rs.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.320
D 16 Rs.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:58.265
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:01.625
Step one is to understand
rates and the nature of work.

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:05.914
The tap fills one by eight of the
tank in one R. That's positive work.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:10.530
The leak empties one by 12 of the tank
in one R, which is negative work step.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.200
Two.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.320
Let's calculate the net
rate with both in action.

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.289
The net rate is rate of
tap, minus rate of leak.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.229
That is one by eight minus one by 12.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.510
The LCM of eight and 12 is 24,
so we get three by 24 minus two

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.120
by 24, which equals one by 24.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.669
Step three is to find the total time.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.810
If the net filling rate is one by
24th of the tank per hour, it'll

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:37.210
take 24 hours to fill the whole tank.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.060
The correct answer is B 24 hours.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.729
Example three, question two.

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.409
Pipes B and Q can fill a tank in 20
minutes and 30 minutes respectively.

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:52.330
If both pipes are open together for
five minutes and then pipe B is closed.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.130
How much more time will pipe Q alone
take to fill the remaining tank options?

00:06:57.609 --> 00:07:03.219
A 10 minutes B, 12.5 minutes
C, 15 minutes D, 17.5 minutes.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.160
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.810
Step one, calculate the individual
rates by p fills one by 20

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.980
of the tank in one minute.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.040
Pipe Q fills one by 30 of
the tank in one minute.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.450
Step two, calculate the combined
rate of P and Q in one minute.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.520
It's one by 20 plus one by 30.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:29.325
The LCM is 60, so three by 60 plus two
by 60 equals five by 60, which simplifies

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:31.065
to one by 12 of the tank per minute.

00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:34.695
Step three, calculate the work
done by both in five minutes.

00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:39.255
That is five multiplied by one by
12, which is five by 12 of the tank.

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:41.655
Step four, find the remaining work.

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:45.945
Total work is one, so one
minus five by 12 gives us seven

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:47.145
by 12 of the tank remaining.

00:07:47.604 --> 00:07:51.474
Step five, calculate time taken
by Q to fill this remaining part.

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:56.515
The time taken will be the remaining
work divided by the rate of Q, so it

00:07:56.515 --> 00:07:58.914
is seven by 12 divided by one by 30.

00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:02.305
This is the same as seven
by 12 multiplied by 30.

00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:07.164
That's 210 divided by 12,
which gives us 17.5 minutes.

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:10.525
The correct answer is D, 17.5 minutes.

00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:11.455
Thank you.

00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.195
See you in the next lecture.
