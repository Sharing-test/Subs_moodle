00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on rate of interest.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.180
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.060
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.180
So what is this rate of interest?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.630
Really think of it as
the price tag on money.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.200
It's the percentage that
money grows by over time.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.200
When you lend money,
you earn this interest.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
And when you borrow
well, you have to pay it.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.160
Simple as that.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.725
Now there are two main
characters in this story.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:35.815
First is simple interest or si.

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:37.825
This one is straightforward.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:42.745
It's calculated only on the initial
amount you borrowed or invested,

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.515
which we call the principle.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:45.955
The interest earned.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.455
Each year is the same.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:48.475
No drama.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.695
It doesn't compound, meaning the interest
you earned last year doesn't start

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:55.465
earning its own interest this year.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:59.315
For this, we have the principle
or P, the starting money.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:03.515
The rate R is the percentage
per year and time.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.045
T is the duration.

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:10.655
In years the final amount A is just
your principle plus all the interest.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.990
Then comes the more exciting
character, compound interest or ci.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.300
This is where the magic happens.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.610
It's calculated on the principle and on
the interest that has already piled up.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.280
It's literally interest on interest.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.880
This means the money
grows faster and faster.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
The frequency of this magic is
called the compounding period.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.560
It could be yearly, half
yearly, quarterly, you name it.

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:39.645
Real world relevance.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:41.835
Now, why should you care?

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:46.035
Because understanding rate of
interest is absolutely crucial

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.595
for many professional roles.

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:52.274
It's the backbone of calculating
loan emis, figuring out returns

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:56.115
on deposits, and pricing, all
sorts of financial products.

00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:59.985
Getting this right means giving
customers accurate advice

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:01.664
and ensuring profitability.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:06.635
It helps you judge the cost of borrowing
and the potential of investments,

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:11.555
which is fundamental to any financial
operation breakdown of question

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.315
types based on patterns in your exam.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.555
Let's break down the types
of questions you likely face.

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:22.775
About 30% of the problems are based
on simple interest, asking you to find

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:28.145
SI principle rate or time, or maybe
juggling multiple sums at different rates.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.090
Another 30% are dedicated to compound
interest problems where you'll be finding

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.150
CI principle rate or the final amount.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.140
Often with tricky compounding periods
like half yearly or quarterly.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.910
Then about 20% of questions love to
pit these two against each other.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.400
Asking for the difference between
SI and CI for two or three years.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.010
The remaining 20% is a mix.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.650
You'll get some questions on installments,
both SI and CI based, and some advanced

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.420
problems that combine concepts.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.915
So a bit of everything,
formulas and tricks.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:08.295
All right, let's get to the
secret weapons, the formulas

00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:10.695
and tricks for simple interest.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:15.795
The bread and butter formula
is si equals p times R, times

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.745
T, all divided by a hundred.

00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:20.985
The final amount is simply principle plus.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:21.045
Si.

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:27.105
For compound interest, the
amount A is P times one plus R

00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:29.145
by a hundred to the power of T.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:31.485
This is for annual compounding.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:35.025
The interest is then
amount minus principle.

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:40.215
If they say compounded half yearly,
just half the rate and double the time.

00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:45.785
So the rate becomes R by two and
time becomes two t. For quarterly.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.065
It's R by four and 40.

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:53.975
Now for some nifty tricks, the difference
between CI and SI for two years is

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:58.955
P times R by a hundred squared For
three years, it's that same formula

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.345
multiplied by three plus R by a hundred.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.810
If a sum doubles in N years at si, the
rate is simply a hundred divided by N.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.050
And if a sum becomes X times in N years
at ci, it becomes four times in two

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.260
Ns, eight times in three Ns, and so on.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.760
Keep these handy.

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:20.505
Methods of solving.

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:23.385
So how do you actually
attack these problems?

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:27.315
For simple interest, it's mostly
direct formula application.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:32.805
Identify what's given, plug the values
into the SI formula and find the unknown.

00:04:33.164 --> 00:04:35.355
Just make sure your time is in years.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.985
If something else is unknown,
just rearrange the formula.

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:46.560
For example, rate is SI times a
hundred divided by P times t. For

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.890
compound interest, you can again use
the direct formula, identify PRT, and

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.090
plug them into the amount formula,
adjusting for the compounding period.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.175
Calculate the amount first, then
subtract the principle to get the ci.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.620
For shorter time periods, you can
do a year by year calculation.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.730
Calculate interest for year one,
add it to the principle, and then

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.150
calculate year two's interest
on this new larger principle.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.390
This really helps you understand
the compounding effect.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
You can also use the effective
rate method for a couple of

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.880
years, which can be a bit faster.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.220
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.445
Want to solve things even faster.

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:30.885
Use the percentage method for
CI for two years at 10% ci.

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:36.675
Year one interest is 10% of P.
Year two interest is 10% of p plus

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:38.655
10% of that first year's interest.

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:43.580
So it's 10% plus 11%
equals 21% of P total.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.130
The ratio method is also
great for two years.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.240
At R percent, the ratio of principle
to amount is a hundred squared

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.979
to a hundred plus R squared.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.820
Then there's the tree method,
which is a visual way to see the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.599
interest buildup perfect for finding
the difference between SI and ci.

00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:05.555
And always remember to adjust the rate
and time for different compounding

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:10.414
periods, creating a new, effective rate,
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.065
All right, listen up.

00:06:12.215 --> 00:06:13.685
Here are the common traps.

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:15.875
First time unit conversion.

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:19.835
Forgetting to change months or days
into years is a classic blunder.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:22.115
Second misinterpreting the rate.

00:06:22.474 --> 00:06:26.315
The formulas use R as a
number, like five for 5%.

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:30.094
Don't write 0.05 unless
you change the formula.

00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:32.965
Third confusing SI and ci.

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:35.695
Don't use the wrong formula
for the wrong problem.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:39.984
Also, people often mess up the
compounding period adjustment, not

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:44.455
changing our anti T correctly, and
of course, simple calculation errors,

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:48.745
rounding numbers too early and confusing
the principle with the final amount.

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:50.455
Are mistakes waiting to happen?

00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:55.854
Always read carefully what the question
is asking for W Edge framework summary.

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:59.215
So let's wrap this up
with a quick summary.

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:00.345
What is it?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:04.065
It's the cost of borrowing
or the return on investment.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:05.745
Why is it important?

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:10.605
It's essential for all things
finance, from loans to investments.

00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:12.135
When is it applied?

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:15.795
Whenever money is borrowed
or invested over time.

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:19.395
Where is it used in banking business?

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:21.344
Government bonds everywhere.

00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:22.724
Who uses it?

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:24.675
Basically everyone.

00:07:24.914 --> 00:07:27.405
Individuals, companies, and banks.

00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:29.295
And how is it calculated?

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:33.495
Using specific formulas for
simple and compound methods

00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:36.224
based on principle rate and time.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.700
Fully worked out Examples.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.740
Okay, enough theory.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.920
Let's get our hands
dirty with some examples.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.240
Example, one simple interest
calculation question.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.910
A sum of money amounts to Rupees
9,800 after five years and

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.790
Rupees 12,005 after eight years.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.430
At the same rate of simple interest, what
is the rate of interest per annum options.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:11.240
A 12% B, 10% C, 15% D 8%
understand the question before

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.610
moving to explanation solution.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.150
Step one, first, let's
understand the problem.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.270
We have the final amount
at two different times.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.530
We need to find the.

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:22.815
Step two.

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:26.925
The difference in amount is the interest
earned in the difference in years.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:32.985
So interest for eight minus five
equals three years is Rupees 12,005

00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:37.965
minus Rupees 9,800, which is 2,205.

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:38.975
Step three.

00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:44.405
If three years of interest is Rupees
2,205, then the simple interest

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:52.025
for one year must be 2,205 divided
by three, which is 735 step four.

00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:54.815
Now we can find the
interest for five years.

00:08:55.175 --> 00:09:01.535
It's just 735 times
five, which equals 3,675.

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:02.655
Step five.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.675
The amount after five years was
principled, plus this five year

00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:17.295
interest, so principle is 9,800 minus
3,675, which gives us 6,125 step six.

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:24.705
Now we have everything using the formula
SI equals P into R into T by a hundred.

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:27.765
We get 3,675.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.590
Equals 6,125 into R into five by hundred.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.770
A little bit of calculation
later, R equals 3,675 into

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.880
hundred by 6,125 into five.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.170
This gives us.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.835
R equals 12%.

00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:53.105
The correct answer is a 12% example
two compound interest calculation

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:57.155
Question, what will be the compound
interest on a sum of rupees?

00:09:57.155 --> 00:10:02.225
25,000 for three years at 12%
per annum compounded annually.

00:10:02.565 --> 00:10:03.165
Options.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:14.175
A 10,123 Rupees, 20 Pesa B 9,000
Rupees C 9,750 Rupees D 10,500 rupees.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:18.345
Understand the question before
moving to explanation solution.

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:21.165
Step one, let's list what we have.

00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:28.545
Principle is 25,000 rate is 12%, and
time is three years compounded annually.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.520
Step two.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:37.350
We use the big formula for amount A equals
P one plus R by hundred to the power T. So

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.760
a equals 25,001 plus 12 by hundred cubed.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:48.780
Step three, this simplifies two
A equals 25,000 times 1.12 cubed.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.090
Now 1.12 cubed is 1.4 0 4 9 2 8.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.865
Step four.

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:57.194
Let's calculate the final amount.

00:10:57.584 --> 00:11:07.725
A equals 25,000 into 1.4 0 4 9 2 8, which
is 35,123 rupees, 20 Pesa, step five.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:12.105
The question asks for the compound
interest, not the amount, so ci.

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:21.995
Equals amount minus principle CI equals
35,123 rues 20 Pesa minus 25,000,

00:11:22.175 --> 00:11:26.075
which equals 10,123 Rupees 20 Pesa.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:29.870
The answer is a 10,123 rupe.

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:33.730
Example, three difference
between SI and ci.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.600
Question.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.020
The difference between simple
interest and compound interest

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.120
on a certain sum of money for two
years at 5% per annum is 15 rupees.

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:45.339
What is the sum options?

00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:53.925
A 6,000 B 5,000 C, 7,500 D 8,000
understand the question before

00:11:53.925 --> 00:11:56.175
moving to explanation solution.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.165
Step one.

00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.295
Here we are given the difference.

00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:05.444
D equals 15 rupees time D equals
two years, and rate R equals 5%.

00:12:05.714 --> 00:12:08.265
We need to find the principle P, step two.

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:11.520
Remember that special trick for
the difference for two years?

00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:15.750
The formula is D equals
PR by a hundred squared.

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:16.650
Step three.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.719
Let's plug in the values 15 equals
P five by a hundred squared.

00:12:21.989 --> 00:12:28.620
Now five by a hundred is one by
20, so 15 equals P times one by 20

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.589
squared, which is B times one by 400.

00:12:31.859 --> 00:12:32.520
Step four.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:39.695
Now just solve for PP equals 15
multiplied by 400 P equals Rupe 6,000.

00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:45.965
So the correct answer is A Rupe 6,000 C.
How a simple trick saves so much time.

00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:46.985
Thank you.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.575
