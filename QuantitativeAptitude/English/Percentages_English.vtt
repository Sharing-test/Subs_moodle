00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on percentage Ever felt

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.240
like your brain needed a power up.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.760
This is it, concept explanation.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:10.395
All right.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:11.715
Let's kick things off.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.084
What exactly is percentage?

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:19.095
Well, it literally means per
hundred or out of every hundred.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.235
It's like saying, Hey, how much
of this whole cake do I get?

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:28.634
But let's imagine the whole cake is
always divided into hundred slices.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:33.705
It's a fantastic way to express
a number as a fraction or a part

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.330
of a whole, but specifically
scaled to a total of a hundred.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.820
Yes, our good old friend, the
percent symbol denotes it.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.060
For instance, if you say 25%, it
means you've got 25 out of a hundred.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.140
Simple write.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
You can also write it as
the fraction 25 by hundred.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.224
Or if you are a fan of
decimals, it's 0.25.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:02.084
Using percentages, my friends, makes
it super easy to compare different

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:07.095
quantities, even if their total amounts
are not the same, because they all

00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:08.865
share a common base of a hundred.

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.255
It's like having a universal
ruler for comparisons.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.384
Real world relevance.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:19.155
Now, why should you as a budding
officer, care about percentages?

00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:21.884
Trust me, it's not just for your exam.

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:23.774
It's your daily bread and butter.

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:28.634
In the banking world, understanding
percentages is absolutely crucial

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.729
for calculating interest on loans
and deposits, assessing profit

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:36.405
and loss in bank operations
because nobody wants a loss.

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:40.604
A, and analyzing financial
statements for risk assessment.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.890
It enables quick estimation of
financial growth and performance,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.660
helping you make sharp decisions and
giving sound advice to your customers.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.770
Think about it.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.190
Interest calculation, whether
it's simple or compound,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.170
relies heavily on percentages.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.380
Profit and loss analysis,
full of percentages.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.509
Discount and commission management.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.700
Again, percentages are king.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.524
Data interpretation.

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.664
Those pesky charts and graphs, they
practically screen percentages,

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:14.135
loan repayment and EMI calculations,
essential percentage work.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:19.115
And for the big picture, understanding
inflation and economic growth analysis

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.575
requires a firm grip on percentages.

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:26.165
It's like the masala in your
banking curry, absolutely essential.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.380
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
Based on my deep dive into past your exam
patterns, I've noticed some recurring

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.940
question formats involving percentages.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.400
It's like they have their favorite tunes.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.560
First up, about 30% of questions are
your basic percentage calculations.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.630
These directly involve finding a
percentage of a number or converting

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.970
fractions and decimals to percentages.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.630
These are your foundational
building blocks, so don't skip them.

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:54.865
Okay.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.650
Then around 25% of questions will test
your knowledge of percentage change,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.900
be it an increase or a decrease.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.130
This includes tricky scenarios
with successive percentage changes.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.495
It's like watching a share price go
up, then down, then maybe up again.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.619
Roughly 20% of questions, cunningly link
percentages with profit and loss concepts.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.690
Here you'll need to calculate profit
percentage, cost, price, or selling price.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.870
It's where business
acumen meets mathematics.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.179
About 15% of questions are related to
population or depreciation problems.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.459
These deal with population growth or
decline over years, or the depreciation

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.420
of asset values over time, applying
those successive percentage changes.

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:43.394
Think of your old phone
losing value every year.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:48.915
And finally, approximately 10% of
questions are part of data interpretation.

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:51.315
That is di involving percentages.

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:56.505
These are those big sets with tables,
bar graphs, or pie charts where the

00:03:56.505 --> 00:04:00.765
core analysis requires calculating
percentages from the given data.

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.975
It's like being a
detective, but with numbers.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.980
Formulas and tricks.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
All right, my friends
time for the secret sauce.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.720
Here are key formulas and
some exam specific tricks For

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.390
percentages served up hot and fresh.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.550
To convert a fraction to a percentage,
just multiply the fraction by a hundred.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.400
For example, three by four multiplied
by a hundred gives you 75% easy.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.850
ZPZ.

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.580
To convert a percentage to a fraction,
simply divide the percentage by a

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.890
hundred, like 60% becomes 60 by a
hundred, which simplifies two three

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.289
fifths for percentage increase.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.799
It's amount of increase
divided by original amount,

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.479
all multiplied by a hundred.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.789
Remember, original amount is key.

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:53.520
Similarly, for percentage decrease it's
amount of decrease divided by original

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.530
amount, all multiplied by a hundred.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:05:01.255
To find a number after R percent increase
the new number equals original number

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:07.045
multiplied by one plus R by a hundred, and
to find a number after R percent decrease

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:11.880
the new number equals original number
multiplied by one minus R by a hundred.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.150
Now for the really cool trick, net
percentage change for two successive

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.650
changes, if an amount changes by
x percent and then by y percent

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.720
successively, the net percentage change
is given by this lovely formula x

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.660
plus y plus XY by a hundred percent.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.380
Just remember to use negative
values for any decrease.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.090
This one's a lifesaver.

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:38.615
Methods of solving beyond the formulas.

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:39.905
Let's talk strategy.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:40.505
My friends.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:44.465
Here are some distinct approaches
to tackle those percentage problems.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:48.455
The unitary method, this is
your reliable old friend.

00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:53.165
It involves figuring out the
value of one unit, say 1% first.

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:57.995
Once you know what 1% is, you
can scale that value to find any

00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:59.225
required quantity or percentage.

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.844
It's super effective when you
have a known value corresponding

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:06.995
to a certain percentage and you
need to find something else.

00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:11.344
Then there's the fraction method,
my personal favorite, convert

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:14.825
those percentages into their
equivalent simple fractional forms.

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:17.914
For example, 25% is one by four.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:19.865
20% is one by five.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:24.485
Performing calculations with fractions
can often simplify your multiplication

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:28.895
and division steps, especially when you
have multiple percentage operations.

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:31.805
It makes complex numbers
look like child's play.

00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:33.995
Next up, the ratio method.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.070
This one's brilliant for expressing
the relationship between quantities.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.900
It's particularly useful in problems
involving comparative percentages,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.130
profit and loss, or population
changes, where you can set up initial

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.530
and final states as neat ratios.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.970
It gives you a bird's eye view and
of course, formula application.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.570
Sometimes the problem just screams
for a direct formula for percentage

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.770
increase or decrease profit or loss
percentage or interest calculations,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.750
just plug in the values directly.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.170
It's a straightforward approach
when the problem directly fits

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.550
A known formula structure.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.410
No need to reinvent the wheel.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.780
Finally, the base change method.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.090
This one's crucial and often overlooked.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:21.045
It's for problems where the reference
base for the percentage changes, you

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:25.965
need to be super careful to identify
the correct base value that is the hole

00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:30.795
against which the percentage is being
calculated to avoid common silly errors.

00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:34.605
A small slip here can cost you
marks, so eyes on the base,

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:36.975
shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.420
All right, my friends, listen up.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.170
These are your secret weapons,
your time saving mantra.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.090
For the exam hall, memorize common
fraction percentage equivalents.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.790
Seriously know them by heart,
knowing that one by two is 50%, one

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.540
by four is 25%, one by five is 20%.

00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:00.065
One by eight is 12.5%.

00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:07.145
One by 10 is 10% and one by 20 is 5% will
significantly speed up your calculations.

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:12.275
It's like having a calculator in your
brain, a Zoom a hundred for unknown

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:17.585
base, when a problem only gives you
percentages and no specific initial value,

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:20.015
like price increased, then decreased.

00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:23.045
Just assume the original
quantity is a hundred.

00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:26.075
This simplifies tracking
changes beautifully.

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:28.330
No need to deal with X right away.

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:34.245
The multiplier method for successive
changes, forget step-by-step calculations.

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:40.965
Use decimal multipliers for a 10%
increase, just multiply by 1.10 for

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:46.755
a 20% decrease, multiply by 0.80,
and for successive changes, simply

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:48.765
multiply these multipliers together.

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:51.795
It's like magic, but it's just smart math.

00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:57.215
Visual estimation or approximation,
especially for multiple choice questions,

00:08:57.395 --> 00:09:01.505
sometimes you can approximate percentages
to the nearest convenient value.

00:09:01.955 --> 00:09:05.915
This can quickly help you estimate
the answer and eliminate incorrect

00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:09.485
options, saving you precious
time for precise calculations.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:12.335
It's about being smart, not just fast.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:16.354
And finally, percentage point
versus percentage change.

00:09:16.775 --> 00:09:19.204
This is a subtle but
important distinction.

00:09:19.564 --> 00:09:24.724
A change from 10% to 12% is a two
percentage point increase, but

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:29.854
it's actually a 20% increase in
value relative to that initial 10%.

00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:31.430
Don't mix these up, my friends.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.490
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.930
Beware my friends.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.160
Here are some classic drafts and
misunderstandings that people often

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.410
fall into when dealing with percentages.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.090
Let's make sure you don't incorrect
base in percentage change.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.680
This is a big one.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.900
A common mistake is calculating percentage
change using the final value as the base

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.270
instead of the original initial value.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.720
Always remember it's change over original.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.650
Confusing, simple and successive changes.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.969
Please don't treat two consecutive
percentage changes as simply

00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:08.410
adding or subtracting them.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.060
They don't work like that.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.859
Always apply the successive percentage
change formula or the multiplier method.

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:17.885
Direct addition or
subtraction of percentages.

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:19.505
This is a no-no.

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:23.855
If the percentages refer to
different bases, for instance, 20%

00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:29.915
of x plus 30% of Y cannot be simply
50% unless X and Y are the same.

00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:32.525
It's like adding apples and oranges.

00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:35.215
Rounding errors in intermediate steps.

00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:38.455
When you are doing multi-step
calculations, rounding off

00:10:38.455 --> 00:10:41.725
values too early can lead
to significant inaccuracies.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:45.865
In your final answer, keep those
decimals until the very end if possible,

00:10:46.285 --> 00:10:48.655
and finally, misinterpreting off.

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:54.145
Don't forget a percent of B literally
means a by hundred multiplied by

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:57.085
B. That little word off is crucial.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.475
W framework summary.

00:10:59.985 --> 00:11:04.365
Let's quickly wrap up with our W Edge
framework for percentages, just in

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:06.050
case you need a super fast recap.

00:11:06.689 --> 00:11:08.460
So what is percentage?

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.430
It's a fraction representing
a part of a hundred.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:16.620
Why do we use it to standardize
comparison of parts relative to a whole?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.340
When is it used, when
expressing proportions, growth,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.290
DK discounts or changes?

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:27.145
Where is it applied in financial
reports, statistics, business

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.604
decisions, and your daily calculations.

00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:30.925
Who uses it?

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:35.694
Bankers, financial analysts,
statisticians, retailers, and really

00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:38.064
any individual managing finances.

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:41.545
And how is it calculated as part by whole?

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:45.295
Multiplied by a hundred, or
using specific change formulas.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:45.985
Got it.

00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:46.944
Excellent.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.650
Fully worked out examples.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.280
Let's put this knowledge to the test
with some fully worked out examples.

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.055
Example, one question.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:12:02.295
In an examination, 70% of the friends
passed in science and 60% passed in Hindi.

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:06.735
If 20% friends failed in both
subjects, what percentage of friends

00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:09.135
passed in both subjects options.

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:10.755
A 30%.

00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:17.985
B, 40% C, 50% D 10% understand
the question before moving to

00:12:17.985 --> 00:12:20.985
explanation solution, step one.

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:23.415
First, let's understand the given data.

00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:27.015
My friends, we assume the total
friends in the examination are a

00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:31.875
hundred percent friends passed in
science, let's call it S, are 70%

00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:38.445
friends passed in Hindi H are 60% now
20% friends failed in both subjects.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.430
Step two.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.160
Time to calculate the
percentage of friends who

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.020
passed in at least one subject.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.860
If 20% friends failed in both,
then a hundred percent minus

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.420
20% gives us 80% friends who
passed in at least one subject.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:58.180
This means friends passed in Science
Union Hindi is 80% step three.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.680
Now we use the classic formula for the
percentage of the union of two sets.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.610
Remember it.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.650
It's P of S Union.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.690
Edge equals P of S plus P of edge
minus P of S intersection edge.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.430
Here, P of S intersection edge is
exactly what we need, the percentage

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.650
of friends who passed in both subjects.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.760
Step four, let's substitute the
known values into our formula.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:27.430
We have 80 equals 70 plus 60
minus P of S intersection edge.

00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:33.935
This simplifies to 80 equals one 30 minus
P of S intersection edge, step five.

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:36.995
Finally, we solve for P of S intersection.

00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:43.115
Edge P of S intersection edge is
one 30 minus 80, which gives us 50%.

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:46.685
Therefore, 50% of friends
passed in both subjects.

00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:50.795
Direct answer C, 50% C, not so tough.

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:53.385
Example two question.

00:13:53.895 --> 00:13:59.055
The population of a town increased
by 20% in the first year and

00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:01.785
decreased by 10% in the second year.

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:06.435
If the present population
is one, lack 8,000, what was

00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:08.115
the population two years ago?

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:17.444
Options A one, lack B, 90,000
C one, lack 20,000 D, 96,000.

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:20.715
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.140
Solution.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.350
Step one, let's understand what's given.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.660
We need to find the population two
years ago, so let's call that P. In the

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.360
first year there was a 20% increase.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.690
In the second year, a 10% decrease, and
the present population is one, lack 8,000.

00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:44.255
Step two, we are going to apply
the successive percentage changes

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.475
using our smart multiplier method.

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:52.895
After a 20% increase, the population
becomes B multiplied by one plus 20 by a

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:56.465
hundred, which is B multiplied by 1.20.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.770
Now from this new population,
there's a 10% decrease.

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:07.069
So the population then becomes P
multiplied by 1.20, and then all

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:12.110
of that multiplied by one minus 10
by a hundred, which simplifies to P

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.465
multiplied by 1.20, multiplied by 0.90.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.890
Step three.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.640
Now we set up the equation
with the present population.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:29.680
So p multiplied by 1.20 multiplied
by 0.90 equals one lack 8,000.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.610
This simplifies nicely to p, multiplied
by 1.08 equals one lack 8,000.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.810
Step four.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:44.110
Time to solve for PP equals
one lack 8,000 divided by 1.08.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.850
A quick calculation shows.

00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:47.735
B equals a hundred thousand.

00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:51.605
Therefore, the population two
years ago was a neat a hundred

00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:53.464
thousand correct answer.

00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:54.875
A one lack.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:16:00.275
See how those multipliers make it
so, quick example, three question.

00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:02.584
A fruit cellar had some apples.

00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:07.145
He sells 60% of the apples
and still has 200 apples.

00:16:07.505 --> 00:16:09.545
How many apples did he have initially?

00:16:11.055 --> 00:16:19.859
A 300 B 400 C 500 D 600 understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:22.365
Solution, step one.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:24.165
Let's get our facts straight.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:29.564
We want to find the total number of apples
initially, so let's call that X. The

00:16:29.564 --> 00:16:35.925
fruit seller sold 60% of his apples, and
importantly, he still has 200 apples left.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:37.015
Step two.

00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:42.175
Now, if 60% of the apples were sold,
what percentage of apples are remaining?

00:16:42.445 --> 00:16:43.015
Simple.

00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:47.485
It's a hundred percent minus
60%, which leaves us with 40%.

00:16:47.935 --> 00:16:51.325
This 40% represents the
apples he still has.

00:16:51.655 --> 00:16:52.405
Step three.

00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:56.305
Let's relate this remaining percentage
to the actual number of apples.

00:16:56.665 --> 00:17:02.185
We know that 40% of the total apples,
which is x, is equal to 200 apples.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.589
So we write this as 40% of X equals 200.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.500
Step four, convert that percentage to a
fraction or decimal, and solve for X 40

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.470
by a hundred, multiplied by x equals 200.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.000
This is 0.40, multiplied by x equals 200.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.520
Now x equals 200 divided
by 0.40 to make it easier.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.530
Think of 0.40 as four by 10.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.460
So x equals 200 multiplied by 10 by four.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.230
This gives us 50 multiplied by
10, which means X equals 500.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.470
Therefore, the fruit seller initially
had 500 apples, correct answer, C 500.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.900
Not a bad haul for a fruit seller, eh.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.040
Thank you.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.720
See you in the next lecture.
