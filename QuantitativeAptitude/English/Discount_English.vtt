00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on discount.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.920
Let's unpack the mystery of this
concept without needing a PhD or a

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.520
panic attack concept explanation.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.860
All right, let's get straight to it.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.360
What is this discount?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.680
It's simply a price cut, a
reduction in the cost of an item.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
It's the seller's way of saying,
Hey, I like you pay a little less.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.040
The original price you see on the
tag is the marked price or mp.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.140
Some people call it the list price.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.540
After the shopkeeper applies their
magical discount, the price you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.750
actually pay is the selling price or sp.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.220
And the most important rule of the
game, my friend, is that discounts are

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.740
always calculated on the marked price.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.180
So just to recap.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.700
Marked price is the sticker price.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.160
Selling price is the final price you pay.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.040
Discount is the juicy reduction you get.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.330
And the discount percentage is
just that reduction shown as a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.830
percentage of the marked price.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.610
Simple.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.880
No.

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:04.755
Real world relevance.

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:10.395
Now you might be thinking, sir, this is
only for shopping now a in, not at all,

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:12.945
especially for a future bank officer.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.075
This concept is your daily chai.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:19.485
Understanding discounts helps in
calculating effective interest rates

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.645
on loans when there are special offers.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:25.705
As an officer, you'll be the one
creating these customer offers,

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:29.905
these discounts on credit cards
and accounts to attract new people.

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:34.795
Grasping this is crucial for financial
product pricing, figuring out the

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.925
real cost after all those rebates.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.715
It's also vital in asset valuation.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:44.035
When a bank deals with repossessed
items, you need to know how to apply a

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:45.940
discount to find a fair selling price.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.480
And of course, for your own
budgeting for purchases.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.700
This knowledge makes you a smarter buyer.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.610
Finally, it's a tool for fraud detection.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.170
If you see a weird pattern of discounts,
it could be a signal for some hanky

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.179
panky that you'll need to investigate.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.039
See, it's everywhere.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.760
Breakdown of question types based
on past patterns for your exam.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.880
The questions on discount come
in a few standard flavors.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.050
About 30% of the time you'll
get a question on basic discount

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.240
calculation, a straightforward problem.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.990
Then about 25% of questions are
on successive discounts where they

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.030
apply one discount after another.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.010
Those can be a little tricky.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.630
Around 20% of problems will mix
discount with profit and loss concepts.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.520
A real test of your fundamentals.

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:38.715
Another 15% will be inverse problems
where you need to do some detective work

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.995
to find the marked price or cost price.

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:46.275
And finally, about 10% are conditional
discounts with scenarios like buy

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:50.145
one, get one free, or discounts
on specific payment methods.

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.055
Formulas plus tricks.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:58.755
Now, for the magic spells, the formulas,
the most basic one is discount equals

00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.585
marked price, minus selling price.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:05.115
The discount percentage is simply the
discount amount divided by the marked

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:06.760
price, then multiplied by a hundred.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:13.445
To find the selling price directly, you
can use SP equals MP times a hundred minus

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:15.725
discount percentage divided by a hundred.

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:20.674
And if you need to find the marked price,
just rearrange that formula for those

00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:23.704
successive discounts of D 1% and D 2%.

00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:28.475
The single equal valent discount
is D one plus D two minus D one

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.334
times D two divided by a hundred.

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:34.825
And here is the superstar formula,
the one that connects everything.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.984
Marked price equals cost price, times
a hundred plus profit, percent divided

00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:41.995
by a hundred minus discount percent.

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:43.885
This one is pure gold.

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:48.924
When profit and discount are in the
same question, methods of solving.

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:50.609
So how do you tackle these problems?

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.385
You have several weapons in your arsenal.

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:55.935
The first is direct Formula application.

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:58.364
Just plug the values
in and get the answer.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.614
This is best for simple questions.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:04.305
Then there is the percentage method
where you convert percentages

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:07.935
into their fractional forms,
like 20% becomes one by five.

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:10.515
This makes calculations much faster.

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:14.685
For successive discount calculation,
you can either find the price after

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:18.464
the first discount and then apply
the second one, or just use the

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:22.395
equivalent discount formula we just
discussed to find a single discount.

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:26.085
The ratio method is excellent
for complex problems where you

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:30.164
establish ratios between cost, price,
selling price, and marked price.

00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:34.125
And finally, there's the unitary
method, my personal favorite.

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:36.974
Just assume the marked price
is a hundred and solve.

00:04:36.974 --> 00:04:40.185
From there, it makes percentages
so much easier to handle.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.020
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.300
Everyone wants shortcuts, right?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.020
So here they are, as we said,
for two successive discounts,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.610
x percent and Y percent.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.200
The single equivalent discount is
x plus Y minus XY by a hundred.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.130
To directly get the selling price
from marked price, just multiply

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.440
the MP by one minus D by a hundred.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.760
This saves you a step.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.970
But the real game changer, the brara
of this topic is the direct relation

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.710
MP divided by CP equals a hundred
plus profit, percent divided by

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.330
a hundred minus discount percent.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.070
Memorize this, it solves complex
questions in seconds, and as I

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.790
said before, when in doubt, just
assume the marked prices a hundred.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.230
It simplifies everything.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:31.165
Lastly, please practice mental math for
common percentages, like 10%, 25%, 50%.

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:33.175
It'll give you a massive speed advantage.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.720
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.500
Okay.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.390
Danger zone, listen carefully.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.640
Here's where good friends lose marks.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.870
The most common mistake is calculating
the discount on the selling price.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.430
Never ever do that.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.760
It is always, always
calculated on the marked price.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.270
Second, you cannot simply
add successive discounts.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.500
A 10% and a 20% discount
is not a 30% discount.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.405
Use the formula.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:02.864
Third, don't confuse
profit loss with discount.

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:05.655
Profit and loss are
calculated on cost price.

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:09.195
While discount is on marked price,
they live in different houses.

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:13.604
Also be careful about applying the
correct formula for the situation.

00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:18.705
And finally, always be clear about your
base value for any percentage calculation.

00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:20.534
Is it CP or mp?

00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:22.724
Knowing this is half the battle won.

00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:25.695
WH framework summary.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.969
So let's put it all in a nutshell
with a quick WH framework.

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.650
What is a discount?

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.780
A reduction in the marked price?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.310
Why is it offered to attract you,
my friend, and to clear stock?

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.140
When do you see it During sales
festivals and for bulk buying?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.789
Where can you find it?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.520
Everywhere from retail stores to online
platforms, and even in financial services.

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.270
Who is involved, the seller who gives
it, and the buyer who benefits from

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.609
it, and most importantly, how is it
calculated always as a percentage of

00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:05.289
the marked price leading to a lower
selling price fully worked out Examples.

00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:06.794
All right.

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:07.635
A theory.

00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:09.164
Let's solve some problems.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:13.215
Example, one basic discount
calculation question.

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:18.945
A shopkeeper marks an article at 800
rupees and offers a discount of 15%.

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:22.395
What is the selling price
of the article options?

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.164
A 680 ru.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:26.985
B 720 Rupees.

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:34.545
C 700 rupees, D 750 Rupees understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:35.355
Okay?

00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:36.495
Let's break it down.

00:07:36.765 --> 00:07:42.855
Step one, the given values are a marked
price of 800 and a discount of 15%.

00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:46.065
Step two, let's calculate
the discount amount.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:52.610
It's 15% of 800, so that's 15 divided
by a hundred, multiplied by 800.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.900
This gives us 15 times eight,
which is one 20 rupees.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.010
Step three.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.960
Now we find the selling price.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.140
It is simply marked
price minus the discount.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.030
So 800 minus one 20 gives us 680 rupees.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.170
Easy peasy.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.505
The correct answer is a. Example,
two successive discounts question

00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:17.474
a jacket is marked at 2,500 rupees.

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:21.945
The shop offers two successive
discounts of 20% and 10%.

00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:25.815
What is the final selling
price of the jacket options?

00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:35.025
A 1,800 B. 1,875 C. 1,900 D 2000 rupees.

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.725
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:39.015
Right.

00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:40.094
Let's tackle this.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.204
Step one.

00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:43.604
Marked price is 2,500 rupees.

00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:47.714
The two discounts are
20% and 10% Step two.

00:08:47.954 --> 00:08:50.324
First, let's apply the 20% discount.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.545
The price becomes 2,500 multiplied
by a hundred, minus 20 by a

00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:59.295
hundred, which is 2,500 times 0.8.

00:08:59.594 --> 00:09:01.545
That gives us 2000 rupees.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.630
Step three.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.090
Now on this new price of 2000 rupees,
we apply the second discount of 10%.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.050
So the final selling price
is 2000, multiplied by a

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.000
hundred minus 10 by a hundred.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.250
That's 2000 times 0.90,
which equals 1,800.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.880
Alternatively, let's use the
equivalent discount formula.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.430
The single discount is 20 plus
10 minus 20 into 10 by a hundred.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:32.064
This is 30 minus two, which is 28%.

00:09:32.395 --> 00:09:37.015
Now calculate the final SP
2,500 multiplied by a hundred

00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:42.385
minus 28 by a hundred, which
is 2,500 times 72 by a hundred.

00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:45.175
This also gives us 1,800.

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:47.755
Both roads lead to the same destination.

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.960
The correct answer is a. Example three.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.480
Discount and profit question.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.650
A manufacturer marks his goods
at 40% above the cost price.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.370
If he allows a discount of
20%, what is his profit?

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.020
Percentage options?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.520
A 8%.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:12.385
B, 10% C, 12% D 15% understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.240
This is a classic.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.200
Let's solve it.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.420
Step one, since no price is given,
let's assume the cost price, or CP

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.100
is a nice round a hundred rupees.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.120
Step two.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:29.600
The marked price is 40% above the cp, so
MP is a hundred plus 40% of a hundred.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.110
That's a hundred plus 40,
which is one 40 rupees.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.130
Step three.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.060
Now a discount of 20% is
given on this marked price.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.939
So the selling price will
be one 40 multiplied by a

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.040
hundred, minus 20 by a hundred.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.990
That is one 40 times 80 by a
hundred, which is 14 times eight.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.320
So the SP is 112, step four.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.330
Finally, let's find the profit.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.400
Profit is SP minus cp, which
is 112 minus a hundred.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.075
The profit is 12 rupees.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.140
To find the profit percentage,
we calculate profit divided

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.610
by CP times a hundred.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.710
So 12 divided by a hundred times
a hundred gives us a neat 12%.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.010
Therefore, the
manufacturer's profit is 12%.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.920
The correct answer is C. Thank you.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.180
