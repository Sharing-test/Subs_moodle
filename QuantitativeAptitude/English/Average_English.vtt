00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.910
Welcome my friend to today's lecture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.160
On average, let's unpack the mystery
of this concept without needing

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.060
a PhD or a panic attack Concept.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.300
Explanation average, my friend, is a
truly fundamental concept in mathematics.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
It's like finding that sweet
spot or typical value for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.360
a whole bunch of numbers.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.695
It gives us a single value
that smartly summarizes the

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.555
entire group of observations.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:35.175
Just think of it as distributing
the total equally among all

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:37.155
elements, fair and square.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.865
The most common type of average we
deal with is the arithmetic mean.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:43.545
How do we calculate it?

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:44.925
Simple, my friend.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:50.055
Just sum up all the values in your
data set, and then divide that grand

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.305
total by the count of those values.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.895
Now let's get down to the basic
terms and related concepts.

00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:58.785
You absolutely need to know.

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:02.385
First up, we have
observations or elements.

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:07.095
These are simply the individual data
points or numbers in a given set.

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:11.625
Then comes the sum of observations,
which is nothing but the grand

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:16.125
total you get by adding all those
individual observations together.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.200
And of course, you need the
number of observations, which

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.250
is just the total count of how
many data points are in your set.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.450
Moving on, we have the fascinating
concept of weighted average.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.310
This is used when different observations
have different levels of importance

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.920
or frequency, what we call weights.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.790
It smartly considers the
importance of each observation.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.460
Next comes consecutive numbers.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.179
These are numbers that follow
each other in perfect order

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.419
without any gaps, like 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.429
And then there are consecutive
even or odd numbers, which are just

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.509
sequences of even or odd numbers
that dutifully follow each other.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.110
For example, 2, 4, 6, or 1 3 5.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.250
Simple, right?

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.825
Now let's get down to
the real world relevance.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.275
Now, why should professionals
care about averages?

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:14.655
Understanding averages my friend
is absolutely crucial for them.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:19.845
It helps them interpret data spot
trends, and make informed decisions

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:22.065
about various financial metrics.

00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:27.855
For customer transaction analysis, banks
use average transaction sizes to cleverly

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.955
understand customer spending behavior.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.680
For loan portfolio performance, average
interest rates and default rates

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.180
are their go-to tools to assess the
overall health of a bank's loan book.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.070
When it comes to employee productivity
metrics, calculating average performance

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.110
scores is key to evaluating team
efficiency and individual contributions.

00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:54.195
For market data interpretation, analyzing
average stock prices or economic

00:02:54.195 --> 00:03:00.015
indicators aids in investment strategy and
risk management, and for account balances,

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:05.295
average daily balances are diligently
used to calculate interest accrual or to

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:07.305
maintain minimum balance requirements.

00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:11.700
Last but not least, branch
performance is judged by comparing

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:16.305
average customer footfall or average
service times all to optimize branch

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:18.825
operations and ensure smooth sailing.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.109
Breakdown of question types.

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.339
All right, friends, let's peek
into the crystal ball of your exam

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.799
patterns based on past trends.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.489
Here are other reoccurring
question formats and average, along

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.320
with their estimated frequency.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.719
Around 30% of questions are your
good old basic average calculation.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.790
These are direct questions where you
find the average sum or number of

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.070
observations given two of the three.

00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:51.834
Then about 25% fall under average
after inclusion or exclusion.

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:56.515
These are problems where a new
observation joins or an existing

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.825
one leaves and the average changes.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:04.075
Next, roughly 20% are weighted
average or group average questions.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.940
These involve finding the
average of combined groups or

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.290
scenarios where observations have
different frequencies or weights.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.420
For 15% of the questions you'll
see average of consecutive numbers.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.190
These problems relate to finding the
average of arithmetic progressions,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.020
including consecutive, consecutive,
even, or consecutive odd numbers.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.080
And finally, about 10% are
average speed questions.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.250
These are specific problems
involving average speed calculation,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:39.989
especially when distances and
times vary formulas and tricks.

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.780
Now for the juicy bits, the essential
formulas and some truly useful tricks for

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.969
average problems, write these down, tattoo
them on your brain, whatever it takes.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.280
The basic average formula is average
equals sum of all observations.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.130
Upon number of observations from that, you
can easily find the sum of observations.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.110
Sum equals average into number of
observations for weighted average.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.500
The formula is weighted average equals
W one X one plus W2 X two plus W

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.365
and XN upon W one plus W2 plus WN.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:22.745
Where X represents your observations
and W are their respective weights.

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:26.345
When it comes to the average
of consecutive numbers, which

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:30.365
are essentially an arithmetic
progression, we have some neat tricks.

00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:34.115
If numbers are in an arithmetic
progression, like consecutive

00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:38.885
integers or consecutive even, or odd
numbers, the average equals first

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.760
number plus last number by two.

00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:42.415
And here's a bonus.

00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:46.585
If the count of numbers is odd, the
average is simply the middle number.

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:49.495
How cool is that for average speed?

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:53.095
The golden rule is average
speed equals total distance

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:55.075
covered upon total time taken.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:59.875
And if you have two equal distances
covered at speeds S one and S two,

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:04.675
then the average speed equals two
s one s two upon S one plus S two.

00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:05.905
Remember this one?

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.165
It's a lifesaver.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:12.765
Now for the tricks my friend, the
real game changers Trick One, increase

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:17.205
or decrease in average if a new
person or item makes an entry and

00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:21.195
the average increases or decreases
the value of this new person or

00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:23.745
item is calculated as new average.

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:27.225
Plus minus number of
original items into change.

00:06:27.225 --> 00:06:32.445
In average, you use a plus if the average
increases and a minus if it decreases.

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:37.365
Trick two person replaced if a
person gets replaced and the average

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:39.195
again increases or decreases.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:44.655
The value of the new person is value of
the old person, plus minus total number

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:46.545
of persons into change in average.

00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:49.785
Again, plus for increase,
minus for decrease.

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:52.155
These strict save precious exam time.

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:53.895
Methods of solving.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:58.365
All right, let's dive into the how
to of solving these average problems.

00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:01.665
We'll cover all the important
and distinct approaches.

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.965
First up, the direct
formula application method.

00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:06.765
This is your bread and butter.

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:10.845
You identify the given values,
then simply substitute these known

00:07:10.845 --> 00:07:14.655
values into the basic average
formula, or its rearranged forms.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.040
Finally, you perform the arithmetic
operations to find your unknown.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.270
Next, we have the deviation
method for changing averages.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.720
You assume a base average,
perhaps the initial average

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.460
or a convenient round number.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.110
Then calculate how much each
observation or the new observation

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.150
deviates from this assumed average.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.010
Some all these deviations.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.740
Divide the sum of deviations
by the number of observations

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.450
to find the average deviation.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.110
Finally, add this average
deviation back to your assumed

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.880
average to get the actual average.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.380
This method is super useful, especially
when just a few values change.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.860
Then there's the reliable
algebraic method.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.980
Here you represent your unknown values
or averages using variables like good

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.159
old X and y. You then formulate equations
based on the information given always

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.530
using the core definition of average.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.109
Finally, you solve the system of equations
to find your required unknown values.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.030
This method, my friend, is robust
and can handle even the trickiest

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.900
problems involving multiple
unknowns or complex relationships.

00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:30.045
And for when numbers get a bit too
large to handle directly, we have the

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:32.415
assumed average or shifting base method.

00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:33.255
Here.

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:36.765
You pick any value within the
range of your given observations

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.805
and call it your assumed average.

00:08:39.255 --> 00:08:43.755
Then you calculate the difference,
the deviation of each observation

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.135
from this assumed average.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.270
Sum all these deviations.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.560
Divide the sum of deviations by
the total number of observations.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.599
Finally, add this result to your assumed
average to get the actual average.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.500
This method truly simplifies
calculations when you are dealing

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.660
with big, intimidating numbers.

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:05.445
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:09.585
Now for the golden nuggets, my
friends, the time saving shortcuts

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:13.575
and smart strategies tailored just
for those exam time constraints.

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:16.515
For the average of consecutive numbers.

00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:21.675
Remember this gem, if the numbers are
consecutive, including even or odd ones,

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.075
the average is simply the middle number.

00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:25.665
If the total count is odd.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.820
If the count is even, it's the average
of the two middle numbers, even simpler.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.670
Always use first, plus last by two.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.170
This works like magic when dealing
with additions or deletions.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.600
Forget recalculating the entire sum.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.075
Instead, embrace the
change in sum concept.

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:48.915
If a value X is added and the average
changes by D, you can quickly find the new

00:09:48.915 --> 00:09:51.555
average by determining the net sum change.

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:56.925
It's about working smarter, not harder
for weighted average, using deviation.

00:09:57.075 --> 00:10:01.515
When combining groups instead of direct
multiplication and division, think

00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:06.165
differently, consider the deviation of
each group's average from the combined

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.685
average or a smartly chosen base average.

00:10:09.015 --> 00:10:11.385
This can simplify your
calculations immensely.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.150
And here's a neat one for
fractions and multiples.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.980
If a question has fractions, for
example, one third of friends consider

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.090
assuming the total number of observations
as a multiple of the denominator.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.950
This simple trick helps you avoid messy
fractions in your intermediate steps.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.870
Finally, for multiple choice questions,
try elimination based on range.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.910
Quickly check if the given options
fall within a reasonable range.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.680
The average will always be between
the smallest and largest observations.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.370
This can often help you
instantly rule out wrong answers.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.485
A true time saver.

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:51.045
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:56.025
All right, listen, our friends, here are
some common pitfalls and misconceptions

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:58.305
that trip up even the brightest minds.

00:10:58.545 --> 00:11:00.525
Let's make sure you don't fall for them.

00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:02.175
The most common error.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:04.484
Forgetting to divide by total count.

00:11:04.785 --> 00:11:09.135
You calculate the sum, but then forget
that crucial last step of dividing

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.935
by the total number of observations.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:16.875
Next miscalculating some simple errors in
addition, especially with large numbers

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:21.314
or many observations, can unfortunately
lead you straight to incorrect averages.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:25.844
A big one for speed problems
incorrectly applying speed formula.

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:29.655
Many friends tend to use the
simple average of speeds like S

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.494
one plus S two by two instead of
the correct average speed formula.

00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:35.655
For varying distances or times.

00:11:35.954 --> 00:11:38.744
Remember, speed isn't
always a simple average.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.510
Another classic is ignoring
weights in weighted average.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.230
When different observations have
different frequencies or importance,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.580
treating them all equally will lead
you to an incorrect simple average when

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.560
you should be using a weighted average
and watch out for assuming arithmetic

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.510
progression where there isn't one.

00:11:58.065 --> 00:12:02.295
Applying the first plus last by
two trick for non-consecutive

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:06.525
or non arithmetic progression
numbers is a recipe for disaster.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:11.325
This shortcut, remember, works
only for arithmetic progressions.

00:12:12.015 --> 00:12:14.655
Lastly, beware of rounding errors.

00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:20.025
Rounding, intermediate calculations
too early can lead to inaccuracies

00:12:20.025 --> 00:12:23.925
in your final average, especially
when dealing with decimals.

00:12:24.435 --> 00:12:27.705
Keep those decimals until
the very end if possible.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.270
WH framework summary.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.160
Let's quickly summarize.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.069
Average using our favorite WH framework.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.050
So what is it?

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:41.550
It's a central value representing
a set of numbers, my friend.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.680
And why do we use it?

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:48.930
To summarize data, compare different
groups, and understand typical values.

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:50.515
When is it applied?

00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:54.685
Whenever you need to analyze
data, performance and trends,

00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:56.305
where can you find it?

00:12:56.724 --> 00:13:01.405
In statistics, finance, sports
science, and yes, even in your

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.685
everyday life, who uses it?

00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:09.805
Analysts, bankers, statisticians,
researchers, and truly the general public.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.745
And how is it calculated By summing all
observations and dividing by their count.

00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:18.115
Simple, effective, and elegant.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.710
Fully worked out.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.400
Examples.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.949
Time for some live action, my friends.

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:24.630
Let's solve some problems.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.069
Example, one basic average
calculation question.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:36.569
The marks obtained by five friends
in a test are 75, 80, 65, 90, and 70.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.074
What is the average mark of the friends?

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:48.410
Options, A 76 B 75 C, 78 D 80 t
understand the question before.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.589
Moving to explanation,
step by step solution.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.300
Step one, list.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.189
The Marx obtained by the friends.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.130
Marx is equal to 75 80, 65, 90, and 70.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.380
Step two, calculate the sum
of all observations marks.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:14.200
Some is equal to 75 plus 80, plus 65
plus 90 plus 70 some is equal to 380.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.120
Step three, count the number of
observations, number of friends, number

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.160
of observations is equal to five.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.040
Step four, apply the average formula.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.210
Average is equal to sum of observations
divided by number of observations.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.780
Average is equal to 380 by five.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.910
Average is equal to 76,
correct answer, a 76.

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:42.165
Example two average
after inclusion question.

00:14:42.435 --> 00:14:46.005
The average age of 10 friends
in a class is 15 years.

00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:50.895
If a new friend joins the class, the
average age increases to 16 years.

00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:54.255
What is the age of the new friend options?

00:14:54.615 --> 00:14:59.324
A 25 years B, 26 years C, 24 years.

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:00.795
D, 27 years.

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:05.975
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, step-by-step solution.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:10.085
Step one, calculate the initial
total age of 10 friends.

00:15:10.475 --> 00:15:15.545
Initial sum of ages is equal to initial
average into initial number of friends.

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:20.645
Initial sum is equal to 15
into 10 is equal to 150 years.

00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:25.145
Step two, calculate the new total
age after the new friend joins.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.470
New number of friends is equal
to 10 plus one is equal to 11.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.410
New average age is equal to 16 years.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.090
New sum of ages is equal to new
average into new number of friends.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:42.280
New sum is equal to 16 into 11
is equal to hundred and 76 years.

00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:45.435
Step three, find the
age of the new friend.

00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:50.565
Age of new friend is equal to new sum
of ages, minus initial sum of ages.

00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:53.715
Age of new friend is equal to 1 76.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.595
Minus one 50 is equal to 26 years.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:16:02.775
Alternatively, using the shortcut value
of new item is equal to new average plus

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.205
number of original items into change.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:09.880
In average, change in average is equal
to 16, minus 15 is equal to one year.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.670
Value of new friend is
equal to 16 plus 10.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.300
Value of new friend is
equal to 26 years, correct?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.480
Answer B. 26 years example.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:20.900
Three.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.960
Average of consecutive numbers question.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.680
The average of five
consecutive odd numbers is 45.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.040
What is the smallest of
these numbers options?

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.450
A 39.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.860
B 41.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.240
C 43.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.215
D 47.

00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:41.585
Understand the question before moving
to explanation, step-by-step solution.

00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:45.725
Step one, understand the property
of consecutive odd numbers.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:50.735
Consecutive odd numbers form an
arithmetic progression for an odd number

00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:52.685
of terms in an arithmetic progression.

00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:54.575
The average is the middle term.

00:16:54.905 --> 00:16:58.385
Step two, identify the
average and number of terms.

00:16:58.775 --> 00:17:00.605
Average is equal to 45.

00:17:00.935 --> 00:17:03.485
Number of terms is equal to five odd.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.860
Step three, determine the middle
term since there are five terms.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:13.260
The third term, middle term is the
average, so the third odd number is 45.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.140
Step four, find the smallest odd number.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.089
The five consecutive odd numbers
will be third term minus four, third

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:25.110
term minus two, third term, third
term plus two, third term plus four.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.160
Substituting the third term, 45,
third term minus four, third term

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:38.050
minus 2 45, third term plus two,
third term plus 4 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.420
The smallest number is 41.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.370
Alternatively, using algebra,
let the smallest odd number BX.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.140
The five consecutive odd
numbers are XX plus two x plus

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.135
four x plus six x plus eight.

00:17:52.735 --> 00:17:56.754
Some of these numbers is equal
to x plus x plus two, plus x

00:17:56.754 --> 00:17:58.435
plus four, plus x plus six.

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:01.645
Plus x plus eight is
equal to five x plus 20.

00:18:02.004 --> 00:18:05.845
Average is equal to some of numbers
divided by number of numbers.

00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:09.294
45 is equal to five x plus 20 by five.

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.725
45 into five is equal to five.

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.135
X plus 22.

00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:16.074
25 is equal to five x plus 22.

00:18:16.074 --> 00:18:25.290
25 minus 20 is equal to five x 205 is
equal to five x. Five by five x 41.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.750
Correct answer B 41.

00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:28.709
Thank you.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.064
See you in the next lecture.
