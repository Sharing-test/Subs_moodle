00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.290
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on simple interest.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.600
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.170
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.820
Simple interest.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.710
Si my friend, is a quick and easy
method to calculate the interest

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.540
charge on a principal amount.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.100
It's determined by multiplying the
principal amount, by the interest

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.140
rate and the number of periods.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:32.395
Unlike its complex cousin
compound interest, simple

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:36.325
interest is only calculated on
the original principle amount.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:41.845
It truly ignores any interest that
has accumulated over previous periods.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:46.705
This makes it a straightforward
way to understand the basic cost of

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:51.504
borrowing or the basic return on an
investment over a specific timeframe.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.055
No hidden surprises here, my dear friend.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.610
Real world relevance.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.080
Now, why is this simple
calculation so crucial you ask?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.539
Well, simple interest is super important
for quick financial calculations

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.890
in banking, like for short-term
loans or basic savings accounts.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.509
It ensures transparent and easy
to understand transactions for

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.340
both customers and institutions.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.360
Let's look at some examples
for personal loans.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
It's often used for short-term
situations where interest is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.970
fixed on the original amount.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.680
Ever bought a car on loan, often
calculated using simple interest.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.950
It keeps your monthly payments
wonderfully consistent.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.870
Even some older student loans,
yes, the ones from back in the day

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.940
might have used simple interest.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.905
Basic savings accounts
usually accrue simple interest

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.335
annually and fixed deposits.

00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:52.175
Their interest is often
calculated using simple interest.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:57.335
Lastly, for bonds, simple interest
is used to figure out the interest

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:00.979
payments on many types, making
it quite versatile in the market.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.740
Breakdown of question types based on past
exam patterns in your competitive exams.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.300
Simple interest questions typically
appear with a frequency of one to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
two questions, which is approximately
three to 5% of the quantitative

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.450
aptitude section, so it's definitely
worth your time to master my friend.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.510
Common question formats include direct
calculation where you find SI principle

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.360
rate or time given the other variables.

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:34.295
Then there are amount based
questions involving the total

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:36.515
amount, which is principle plus si.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:41.855
You might also encounter rate, time
variation problems where the rate or time

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:44.345
changes directly affecting the interest.

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:48.545
While installment based questions
are less common for simple interest,

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:50.795
some basic ones might still appear.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.345
And finally, comparison problems.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.110
Where you compare simple interest with
compound interest, these are often

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.220
combined with CI topics, so keep your
eyes peeled for those tricky ones.

00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:04.935
Formulas plus tricks.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.905
All right, let's get to
the heart of the matter.

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:12.495
The key formulas and clever tricks
you absolutely need to master.

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:17.955
The fundamental formula for
simple interest si is si equals

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:20.830
P into R into T upon hundred.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.050
Here.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.100
B stands for principle, which
is your initial amount of money.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.640
R is the rate of interest
always per annum.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.140
Remember that, and D is time,
which must always be in heres.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.950
Got it.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.450
Don't mess up your units.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.710
It's a common mistake.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:42.685
Now the total amount A, if you
need to calculate that, is simply

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:44.575
principle plus simple interest.

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:51.445
Or you can use its expanded form A
equals P one plus RT upon hundred.

00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:56.214
Now for some exam specific tricks that
will surely make you a math wizard.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.120
One when PRT are given you find si
by directly applying the formula.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.739
EZPZ, no sweat.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.579
Two.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.090
When si RT are given and you need
to find P. Just remember p equals si

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.320
into hundred upon R into t. Three.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.589
If IPT are given and you are looking
for R, the rate then R equals si

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:23.800
200 upon p and two T and four.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.350
If IPR are given and you need
T the time it's T equals si

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.560
into hundred upon p and two RC.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.655
Just a bit of clever
rearrangement my friend.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.550
Here's a super trick.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.440
If a sum doubles in N years at
si, then the rate R is simply

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.330
a hundred divided by N percent.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.100
Bam, instant answer.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.230
And if a sum becomes X times its
original value in N years at si,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.690
then R is X minus one multiplied
by a hundred, all divided by 10%.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.730
These are your secret weapons.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.385
Use them wisely, always.

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:01.845
Methods of solving.

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:05.445
Let's talk about the various
methods of solving these problems.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.525
The most straightforward approach
is direct formula application.

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:13.995
You just substitute the given values
straight into the simple interest formula.

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:19.485
SI equals PRT upon a hundred, or its
variations to find that unknown variable.

00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:23.325
This method is perfect when all
the necessary components are

00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:24.315
sitting right there, friend.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.300
Next we have the unitary method.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.580
This involves calculating the interest
for one unit, say one year or one

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.620
rupe, and then cleverly scaling it to
the required principle rate or time.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.670
It's incredibly useful for grasping
the proportional relationship

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.260
between all those variables.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.650
Then there's the percentage method.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.330
Since interest rates are usually given
as percentages, you can simply treat the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.610
interest as a percentage of the principle.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.260
For example, if the rate is 10% per
annum, the interest for one year

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.630
is exactly 10% of the principle.

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:03.225
You can easily extend this
for multiple years, making

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:05.565
calculations quite intuitive indeed.

00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:10.125
For problems involving comparisons
or changes in principle rate or

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.275
time, the ratio and proportion
method comes in handy.

00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:17.955
This technique helps you set up clear
relationships between different scenarios

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:20.025
to pinpoint those unknown values.

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:24.645
And finally, for the more complex
problems, especially those with multiple

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:29.475
transactions or interconnected variables,
the algebraic method is your best friend.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.330
Setting up proper algebraic equations
based on the simple interest

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.230
formula can effectively untangle
even the most knotted problems.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.450
So many ways to get to the same answer.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.545
Isn't it wonderful, my friend?

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.710
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.780
All right, my friends time for some
super shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.320
That'll definitely save you
precious seconds in your exam.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.100
First up, mental calculation
for multiples of a hundred.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.180
If your principle is a nice multiple
of a hundred, and the rate and

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.080
time are simple numbers, you can
often calculate SI in your head.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.110
For example, SI for RS 500
at 10% for two years is 500.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.500
Into 10 by a hundred into two,
which is a neat hundred rupees.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.490
See no calculator needed,
just pure brain power.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.460
Next fractional rates slash times.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.560
Don't be scared of percentages.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.080
Convert them to simple fractions,
like 25% to one fourth and always,

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:30.915
always convert time to years.

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:32.335
Six months.

00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:35.215
That's 0.5 years, 73 days.

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:37.765
That's 73 by 365 years.

00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:40.675
Simplifies everything,
trust me on this one.

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:43.825
Then we have the effective
rate for multiple years.

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:49.495
For simple interest, the effective rate
over T years is just R into T. So your

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:52.300
SI equals P into R into T by hundred.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.440
This clever trick helps you
avoid repeated calculations and

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.000
makes things super efficient.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.800
Now, a little bonus, the difference
between SI and CI for two years.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:08.620
While this module focuses on si, sometimes
just sometimes your exam might throw

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.720
in a curve ball comparing SI and ci.

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.095
For two years.

00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:16.205
The difference between CI and
SI is PR by a hundred squared.

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:19.295
This shortcut can genuinely
save you time if such a

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:21.125
comparison appears in your paper.

00:08:21.425 --> 00:08:25.835
And finally, the rule of 72, which
is mostly for compound interest,

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:29.465
but a simplified version can be
used for rough estimates in si.

00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:32.975
If for sum doubles, then
R into T equals a hundred.

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:36.995
So if R is known, T equals a
hundred by R. Pretty neat, right?

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.890
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.550
Now, pay close attention, my
friends, because these are the

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.180
common mistakes and misconceptions
that can tragically cost you.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.760
Marks the absolute most frequent error is
confusing, simple and compound interest.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.770
Please for the love of numbers.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.190
Remember, simple interest
is only calculated on the

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.355
original principle amount.

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:01.665
It doesn't care.

00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:04.995
One bit about accumulated interest,
like compound interest does.

00:09:05.324 --> 00:09:08.175
Keep them separate in your
mind like chalk and cheese.

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.425
Second incorrect time unit.

00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:12.135
This is a classic trap.

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:16.724
Time must always be in your, if
it's given in months, divide by 12.

00:09:16.905 --> 00:09:19.484
If it's in days divide by 365.

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:22.275
Don't let a tiny unit
conversion trip you up.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.760
It's a silly mistake to make.

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:26.205
Third misinterpreting rate.

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:29.505
The rate is almost always
per annum, per year.

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:33.585
Ensure there's consistency in units
between your rate and your time.

00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:36.255
A mismatch will surely
lead to a wrong answer.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:39.075
Fourth plain old calculation mistakes.

00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:42.345
Simple arithmetic mistakes,
especially with fractions or

00:09:42.345 --> 00:09:44.190
decimals as surprisingly common.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.830
Always double check your
calculations, especially when the

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.390
clock is sticking in your exam.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.420
And finally, not reading
the question carefully.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.730
Sometimes questions will ask for the
amount, which is principle plus si, and

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.650
not just the simple interest itself.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.395
Always, always confirm what the question
is asking for before you proudly mark

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.740
your answer, read, understand, then
calculate with confidence, my friend.

00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:11.235
W Edge Framework Summary.

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:14.565
Let's quickly summarize with
our W Edge framework summary.

00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:16.665
So what is simple interest?

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:20.205
It's interest calculated only
on the principle amount, no

00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:22.155
extra drama or hidden charges.

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:23.535
Why is it important?

00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:26.775
Because it simplifies interest
calculations and gives us a.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.100
Crystal clear understanding of
earnings or costs over time.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.360
When is it applied?

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.780
You'll commonly see it in
short-term loans, basic savings

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.340
accounts, and fixed deposits.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.580
Where is it used in the
big wide world of banking?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.700
Your personal finance and
basic investment scenarios.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.410
Who benefits or uses it?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.800
Individuals, banks, and
other financial institutions.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.340
And how is it calculated
using the super handy formula?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.890
SI equals PRT by hundred.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.090
Got it, my friend.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.140
Fantastic.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.610
Fully worked out examples.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.340
Example, one question.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.000
What is the simple interest
on a principle of rupees?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.360
12,000 at an interest rate of 8% per
annum for three years, a rupees 2,880 B

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:22.130
rupees 2,560 C rupees 3000 D rupees 2,720.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.340
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.599
Step-by-step solution.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.420
First, identify the given values.

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:33.780
Your principle P is rupe is 12,000.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.560
The rate R is 8% per annum and
the time T is three years next.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.594
Recall the simple interest formula si
equals P into R into T by a hundred.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:53.040
Now substitute these values into
the formula si equals 12,000

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.770
into eight into three by hundred.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.720
Let's perform the calculation.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.310
You can effortlessly cancel out
the two zeros from 12,000 with

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.020
the a hundred in the denominator.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.670
So si equals one 20 into eight into three.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.785
This gives us nine 60 multiplied
by three, which equals 2,880.

00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:16.345
Correct answer.

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:20.845
A Rupees 2,880 Simple right example.

00:12:20.905 --> 00:12:22.045
Two question.

00:12:22.314 --> 00:12:27.235
A sum of money invested at simple
interest doubles itself in five years.

00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:29.545
What is the annual rate of interest?

00:12:29.814 --> 00:12:31.074
A 10%.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:32.935
B, 15%.

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:34.675
C 20%.

00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:36.290
D 25%.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.730
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.380
Step-by-step solution first, understand
the problem thoroughly, my friend.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.240
The sum doubles, meaning if your
principle B is the initial amount,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:55.594
then the total amount A becomes two
p. Since we know that amount A equals

00:12:55.594 --> 00:13:01.625
principle P plus simple interest si,
we can write two p equals p plus si.

00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:07.025
This directly implies that your simple
interest si is equal to your principle

00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:09.305
P. See how easily that unfolds.

00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:11.255
Now, identify the given values.

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:17.105
Your simple interest SI is P equal
to the principle and your time.

00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:18.485
T is five years.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:25.145
Recall the formula for finding the
rate R equals SI 200 by P into T.

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:31.475
Substitute the values into the formula
R equals P into hundred by P into five.

00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:32.730
Perform the calculation.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.610
You can simply cancel out P from both
the numerator and the denominator,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.710
leaving us with a clean calculation.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.600
So R equals a hundred by five,
which immediately gives you R

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.199
equals 20, correct answer C, 20%.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.420
Another piece of cake, isn't it my friend?

00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:51.530
Example three.

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:56.605
Question, at what rate of simple
interest will rupees 800 amount

00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:59.155
to rupees 920 in three years?

00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:08.335
A 4% B, 5%, C 6% D 7% understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.000
Step-by-step solution.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.850
First, let's identify the given values.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.819
Your principle B is rupees 800.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.660
The total amount A it grows to is rupees
920 and the time T is three years.

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:25.060
Next, calculate the simple interest.

00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:28.810
Remember, si equals amount minus princip.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:35.905
So si equals nine 20 minus 800,
which means si equals rupees one 20.

00:14:36.055 --> 00:14:37.944
That's the exact interest earned.

00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:44.035
Now recall the formula for eight
R equals si 200 by P in two T.

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:45.950
Substitute the values into the formula.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.380
R equals one 20 into
hundred by 800 into three.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.880
Time for the calculation.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.350
This gives you R equals 12,000 by 2,400.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.510
When you divide 12,000 by 2,400,
you will precisely get R equals

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.449
five, correct answer B 5%.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.630
C. How logical and straightforward
it all is, my friend.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.439
Thank you.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.745
See you in the next lecture.
