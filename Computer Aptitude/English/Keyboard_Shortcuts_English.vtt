Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.800
Think of this as a cheat
code for understanding this

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.220
concept, concept explanation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.040
So what are these keyboard shortcuts you
ask are a simple, they are combinations

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.050
of keys on your computer keyboard.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
When you press them together, they
perform specific actions much faster

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.460
than using that lazy mouse of yours.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.049
Think of them as secret codes that
tell your computer to do something

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.510
instantly, like saving a document,
copying text, or opening a new window.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.970
They are designed to boost your efficiency
and make you look like a computer wizard.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.640
Real world relevance.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.590
Now, why should you care?

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.880
Because keyboard shortcuts are
absolutely crucial for enhancing

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.100
productivity in daily operations.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.410
Imagine faster data entry.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
You can quickly navigate and
input data in various banking

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.769
software without endless clicking.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.805
Or think about efficient
document management.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:09.245
You can rapidly save print and
open documents, which is so

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:12.965
important for things like loan
applications or customer records.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:18.575
Even for seamless communication, you can
swiftly compose emails or switch between

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.035
applications during customer interactions.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.505
And here's a big one, improved accuracy.

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:28.285
Relying less on the mouse
minimizes potential errors

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.205
in critical financial tasks.

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.024
It's all about time management, my friend.

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:37.074
Saving precious seconds on
repetitive tasks allows more

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:39.294
focus on complex problem solving.

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:43.405
Plus, it shows a command over
your tools, reflecting true

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:45.505
professionalism and tech savviness.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
Breakdown of question types
based on past exam patterns for

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.490
computer aptitude in your exam.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.780
Questions on keyboard shortcuts
usually come in a few flavors.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.430
About 40% of the time you'll
get a direct recall question.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.500
This is a straightforward memory test,
like what is the shortcut to copy text?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.780
Then for about 30% of
questions, they flip it.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.640
This is action identification where
they give you a shortcut, like

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.250
control S and ask what it does.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.860
Around 20% are application specific
related to programs like MS.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.470
Word, Excel, or the Windows os.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.540
For example, in MSXL, which
shortcut inserts a new row.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
And finally, a small 10% might be fill
in the blanks or matching questions,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.780
though these are less common.

00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:42.885
Formulas and tricks.

00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:47.625
While there are no magical formulas,
there are some key shortcuts and

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.725
tricks to make them stick in your head.

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:52.274
Let's go through the general purpose ones.

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:56.625
Control C is for copy,
control X is to cut.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:58.905
Control V is for paste.

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:04.750
Control Z will undo your mistake and
control Y will redo it for files.

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:07.815
Control S is for save control.

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.885
P is for print control.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.585
A is to select all control.

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:17.385
F is to find something, control
n create something new, and

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:19.425
control O will open a filer.

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.695
W closes a window or tab.

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.150
The window key opens the start menu.

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:29.375
Windows Key E opens File
Explorer, and Windows.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.205
Key D shows the desktop.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:35.555
A very useful one is Windows
Key L to lock your pc.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:40.475
To switch between open apps,
use ALT tab for renaming a file.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.065
Just press F two.

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:48.005
To refresh a page hit F five and the
classic ALT F four closes the app.

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:52.325
F1 is for help and F 11
gives you full screen.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.620
For memorization, think like this.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.340
C, X and V are all
neighbors on the keyboard.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.150
Making them a little family
for copy cut and paste.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.750
Z is like going back in the alphabet,
so it's for undo Y is right after, so

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.450
it's for redo or moving forward again.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.094
S is for save, P for print, A
for all, F for find and for new.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.539
O for open.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.589
Easy peasy.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.840
Think of alt tab as alternating between
your tabs and F two for renaming.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.630
Just think file two needs a new name.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.580
Methods of Solving.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:36.580
So how do you master these first
use categorization group shortcuts

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.505
by their function like editing,
navigation, or file management.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.980
Next try application specific learning.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.030
Focus on the shortcuts for one
program at a time like Excel.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.500
Don't mix everything up.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.660
Use logical association.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.280
Connect the key to the action
like we just did with S for save.

00:04:56.715 --> 00:05:00.015
The most important method
is muscle memory practice.

00:05:00.224 --> 00:05:01.335
Use them daily.

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:04.605
The more you use them, the
more they become automatic.

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.335
And finally, use contextual learning.

00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:11.745
Learn them as you perform tasks, not
just by memorizing a boring list.

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:15.285
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.325
Here are some smart techniques.

00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:19.995
Prioritize the high frequency shortcuts.

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:24.705
First, copy, paste, save,
undo, select all these.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.415
Give you the biggest time savings.

00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:27.645
Practice daily.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:28.185
Make it a habit.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.400
For learning, you can use cheat sheets.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.570
Keep a small list handy, but over
time you'll find you don't need it.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.610
Also, explore the menus.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.690
In new applications, they often show
the shortcut right next to the command.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.280
A great way to learn and you don't
have to abandon your mouse completely.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.470
Use shortcuts for frequent actions and the
mouse for things that need more precision.

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.765
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.465
Now, let's talk about the common traps.

00:05:57.795 --> 00:06:00.405
Many beginners, confuse, control and alt.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:05.565
Just remember, control is usually for
direct commands, while alt is often

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.390
for menu access or special functions.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.730
Don't forget the shift key.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.440
It often modifies other shortcuts like
shift delete for a permanent delete.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.700
A big misconception is assuming
a shortcut works everywhere.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.950
While many are universal like Ctrl C,
some are unique to specific software.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.700
The biggest mistake is over
reliance on the mouse and not

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.260
even trying to use shortcuts.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.500
And please don't try to
memorize a huge list at once.

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:34.765
That's a recipe for disaster.

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:36.625
Focus on a few at a time.

00:06:36.924 --> 00:06:38.905
WH framework summary.

00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:44.244
So to quickly summarize, using our
framework, what are keyboard shortcuts?

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:47.604
They are combinations of
keys for specific commands.

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:52.554
Why do we use them to increase
efficiency, speed, and productivity?

00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:54.414
When should you use them?

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:58.494
Whenever you need to do a common
action quickly without the mouse.

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:03.035
Where are they used across
operating systems like Windows in

00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:07.835
software, like MS. Office, and in
many other programs Who uses them?

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:12.905
Anyone on a computer, especially
professionals who want a faster workflow,

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:18.485
and how do they work by pressing two or
more keys together to trigger a command?

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:21.575
Simple, fully worked out examples.

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:24.395
All right, let's tackle some examples.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.860
Example, one question.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.730
Which of the following keyboard
shortcuts is used to copy,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.770
selected text, or an object?

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:41.060
A, control x, B, control V. C, control
C. D control, Z. Understand the

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.280
question before moving to explanation.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.770
Step one is to understand the goal.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.599
The question wants, the shortcut
for copy copying makes a duplicate.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.400
It doesn't remove the original.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.580
Step two is to recall
the common shortcuts.

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:58.159
We know control X is cut.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.789
CTRL V is paced and control Z is undo.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.989
Step three is to identify the correct one.

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.669
The shortcut for copy starts
with A C, so it is control C.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.340
Step four, we verify the option.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.530
Option C matches our logic.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.969
Perfectly correct.

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:20.425
Answer C control C. Example two question.

00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:24.745
In most applications, what action
is performed when you press

00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:27.865
control SA, open a new document.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.085
B, save the current document.

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:33.895
C, print the document D,
close the application.

00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:36.740
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.715
First, let's analyze the shortcut.

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:43.435
Control S. The letter
S is a big hint here.

00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:46.915
What action starts with S Save of course.

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:50.205
Let's evaluate the other
options just to be sure.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.725
Opening a new document is usually
Control N printing is control P

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:58.605
closing an application is ALT F four.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:03.135
So we can confidently conclude
that Control S is used to

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:05.535
perform the save action, correct.

00:09:05.535 --> 00:09:08.205
Answer B, save the current document.

00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:10.545
Example three question.

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:14.265
If you want to quickly switch
between different open programs

00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:18.104
or windows on your computer, which
keyboard shortcut would you use?

00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:23.745
A Alt F four B, control SC, alt tab D.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:28.275
Windows Key L. Understand the
question before moving to explanation.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:32.115
The goal here is to switch
between different open programs.

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:35.084
This means cycling through
what you have open.

00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:36.490
Let's look at the options.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.380
Alt F four closes the
program, not what we want.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.150
CTRL esque usually just
opens the start menu windows.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.430
Key L is for locking your pc.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.680
That leaves us with alt tab.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:55.350
This is the one designed for alternating
tabs or cycling through open applications.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.300
It directly addresses the need.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.590
Correct answer.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.120
See ALT tab.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.110
Thank you.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.700
See you in the next lecture.
