Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on internet.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.860
Ever felt like your
brain needed a power up?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.510
This is it.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.090
Concept explanation.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
So what is this internet that
everyone from your auntie to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.170
your bank manager talks about?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.190
Think of it not as one single thing, but
a colossal worldwide network of networks.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.280
It's a JBI of millions of private,
public, academic, and business networks

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.400
all tangled up, linked by everything
from fancy optical cables to the wifi

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.860
signal you are probably using right now.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.600
At its heart, the
Internet's job is simple.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.790
Let computers all over the world talk
to each other and share information.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.800
How does it do this magic?

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.680
It breaks your data, say a cat video
into tiny little pieces called packets.

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:03.605
These packets are like little
adventurers, each traveling independently

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:08.705
across the network jungle, and then
miraculously reassembling in the

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:10.895
correct order at the destination.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.270
This whole circus is managed
by rules or protocols mainly.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:23.495
TCP ip, every device, your phone, your
laptop, has a unique IP address, which

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:28.265
is like its postal code, making sure
the data packets don't get lost and

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:33.545
end up at your neighbor's house To
make our lives easier, the domain name

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:39.785
system or DNS acts like a phone book,
translating easy names like google.com

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.605
into those number heavy IP addresses.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.120
And the worldwide web, the www,
that's just one service, a system

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.650
of interconnected documents that
runs on top of the internet highway.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.220
Real world relevance.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
Now, why is this important for
something like banking array?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.190
It's fundamental.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.150
The internet is the very
backbone of modern finance.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.760
It's what allows banks to offer all their
digital services and keep data secure.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.079
Online banking, that's the
internet, letting you securely

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.475
manage your money from your couch.

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:23.185
It enables instant communication with
clients through email and video calls,

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.585
so no more waiting in long queues.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.905
Financial professionals get
immediate access to market news

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:31.975
and updates, which is crucial.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.265
It powers online customer support
with chat bots and virtual

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:38.435
assistance answering your queries at.

00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:45.025
2:00 AM and for the bank's own operations,
it's vital for cloud storage, secure data

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:47.875
transfers, and creating robust backups.

00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:53.245
It even helps with regulatory compliance
by providing quick access to all the

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:55.795
necessary guidelines and reporting tools.

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:58.075
Breakdown of question types.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:01.515
All right, let's get into
strategy for your exam.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.485
Questions on this topic
aren't there to trick you.

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:07.125
They just come in a
few predictable styles.

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:12.375
About 30% of the time you'll see questions
on basic definitions and concepts.

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:18.225
These tests, if you know fundamental
terms like internet, www browser, and so.

00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:23.665
Then with about 25% frequency
come the acronyms and full forms.

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.395
They love asking for the
full form of things like

00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:30.115
H-T-T-P-F-T-P-U-R-L and TCP, ip.

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:35.065
Next up with a 20% chance our questions
on protocols and their functions.

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:40.984
Asking you to match a protocol like SMTP
to its job, which is sending emails.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:45.394
Questions on applications and
services appear about 15% of the

00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:49.565
time, focusing on how the internet
is used, especially in banking.

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:54.425
Finally, there's a 10% slice for
security and threats covering basic

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:56.675
concepts like phishing and firewalls.

00:03:57.495 --> 00:03:58.965
Formulas and tricks.

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:01.245
The best part, no math.

00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:04.365
The tricks here are all
about smart memorization.

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:11.025
For acronyms, use association in HTTP,
edges for hypertext, T for transfer,

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:16.130
P for protocol, simple for protocols,
link them directly to their main job.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.950
Just remember FTP is for file transfer.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.420
It's that straightforward.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.010
Also, try mentally categorizing
terms into groups like protocols or

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.150
applications to help your brain organize
the information for faster recall.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.500
Methods of solving to tackle
these questions head on.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.650
Use these methods for
definitions and acronyms.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.900
It's about direct recall from your memory.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.039
If a question asks about a protocol's
function, you can often deduce

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.630
it from its name or common use.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:50.185
When faced with a real world scenario,
just map the situation to the most

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:54.565
relevant internet service and never
forget the classic method of elimination.

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:58.195
In multiple choice questions, get
rid of the obviously wrong answers

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:00.174
first to narrow down your choices.

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:04.495
Finally, for application-based
questions, understanding the context

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:06.534
is key to applying the right concept.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.100
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some clever shortcuts.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.900
Create a flashcard system for all
important acronyms and key terms.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.870
A quick daily review does wonders or
draw a mind map, put internet in the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.060
center and branch out to protocols,
services, security, and so on.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.060
This visually connects all the concepts.

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:34.495
Regularly practice with mock
questions on computer aptitude to

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:36.385
get comfortable with the patterns.

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:40.885
And a great technique is to focus
on keywords in the question.

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:45.475
If you see sending email, your
brain should immediately scream.

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:46.435
SMTP.

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:50.175
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:53.055
Now, let's discuss the common traps.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:57.315
Don't be the friend who confuses
the internet with the worldwide web.

00:05:57.675 --> 00:05:59.955
The web is a service on the internet.

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:02.595
The internet is the whole infrastructure.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.650
Another classic mixup is
IP address versus URL.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.260
The IP is the numerical address.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.160
The URL is the human friendly
name, like a website link.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.050
People also often misidentify
protocol functions like confusing.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.295
The one for.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.210
Sending email with the
one for receiving it.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.980
A big mistake is ignoring security
terms like phishing or malware

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.900
in the context of banking.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.540
These are extremely important and
please avoid using outdated information.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.580
The tech world moves fast.

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:38.745
WH framework summary.

00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:40.425
So a quick summary.

00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:41.385
What is it?

00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:45.045
A massive global network of
interconnected computers.

00:06:45.285 --> 00:06:49.155
Why does it exist to enable
worldwide communication and

00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:50.985
access to digital services?

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:56.025
When is it used constantly for
almost everything we do online.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:56.710
Where is it?

00:06:57.275 --> 00:07:00.035
Accessible globally on all our devices.

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:01.235
Who uses it?

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.035
Basically everyone.

00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:05.945
Individuals, businesses, and governments.

00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:07.835
And how does it all work?

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:09.845
Through a set of standard rules.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:14.525
The protocols like TCP IP that
manage how data zips around

00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:16.595
fully worked out examples.

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:18.320
Let's see this in action.

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:21.465
Example, one question.

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:27.135
What is the full form of H-T-T-P-A
protocol widely used for transmitting

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:28.660
web pages over the internet?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.310
A hyper text transfer protocol.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.310
B, high transfer type protocol.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.909
C hyperlink, text transmission program.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.820
D, home text transfer program.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.360
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.620
Step one is to understand the
question asks for the full

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.110
form of the acronym, HTTP.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.190
This is a very common and
fundamental protocol for the web.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.110
Step two is to recall the
full form from your memory.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.550
HTTP stands for hypertext
transfer protocol.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.360
Step three is to compare
this with the given options.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.850
Option A is a perfect match.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.130
The others are clearly incorrect.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.500
So step four is to select
the correct option, answer a

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.660
hypertext transfer protocol.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.260
Example two question.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.370
Which of the following protocols
is primarily used for sending

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.360
emails over the internet?

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:38.145
A-F-T-P-B-H-T-T-P-C-S-M-T-P-D-D-N-S
understand the question

00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:39.944
before moving to explanation.

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:42.284
First, analyze the question.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:46.755
It specifically asks for the
protocol used for sending emails.

00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:50.584
Second, recall the functions
of the protocols listed.

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:53.135
FTP is for file transfer.

00:08:53.495 --> 00:09:00.665
HTTP is for webpages, SMTP or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol is for sending emails.

00:09:00.995 --> 00:09:03.635
DNS is for translating domain names.

00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:06.694
Third, you match the
function to the protocol.

00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:09.665
The one for sending mail is SMTP.

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:13.444
Therefore, the fourth step is
to choose the correct option.

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:20.755
Answer C-S-M-T-P example three
question in the context of banking.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.584
How does the internet primarily
facilitate services like NEFT

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:30.925
and R-T-G-S-A by providing
physical cash transaction points.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:35.005
B, by enabling real-time
electronic fund transfers.

00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:39.385
C, by allowing customers to
open physical bank branches.

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:42.444
D by printing, physical bank statements.

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:48.155
Understand the question before moving to
explanation First, understand the terms.

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:52.985
NEFT and RTGS are electronic
fund transfer systems.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:56.074
Second, relate this to
the Internet's function.

00:09:56.435 --> 00:10:00.755
The internet is the network that
lets banks process these electronic

00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:03.305
transactions securely and instantly.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:05.615
Third, evaluate the options.

00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:09.800
Physical cash points are the
opposite of what N-E-F-D-R-T GS do.

00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:14.555
Enabling electronic transfers perfectly
describes the Internet's role.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:19.145
Opening branches and printing statements
are not the primary function here.

00:10:19.445 --> 00:10:25.835
So the final step is to select the most
accurate option, answer B by enabling

00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:28.175
realtime electronic fund transfers.

00:10:28.865 --> 00:10:29.225
Thank you.

00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:30.995
See you in the next lecture.
