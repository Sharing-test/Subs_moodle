00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.070
Welcome my friend to today's
lecture on computer hardware.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.220
This concept looks scary, don't worry.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.415
We brought snacks and metaphors.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.959
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.900
So what is this hardware
business all about?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.150
Simply put, computer hardware
refers to all the physical, tangible

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.130
components of a computer system.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.900
These are the parts you can see,
touch, and probably shouldn't drop.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.755
It includes every single electronic
and mechanical part that makes

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:36.170
a computer come to life from the
powerful central processing unit.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:40.655
Or CPU all the way to your
humble keyboard and mouse.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.335
You see, without this hardware,
all the fancy software in the world

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:50.165
would have nothing to run on, and a
computer system simply wouldn't exist.

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:53.075
Let's look at the key
players in this team.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:58.265
First is the central processing unit,
often called the brain of the computer.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.715
This little genius performs
most of the processing.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:03.845
Then we have memory.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:08.595
Ram Random access memory, which
is like the computer's temporary

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:11.085
scratch pad for data and programs.

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.035
The CPU is currently juggling.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:17.865
It's volatile, meaning poof,
the data is gone when the power

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.205
is off for keeping things safe.

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:23.475
We have storage devices
like a hard disk drive.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.030
HDD or a solid state drive.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.140
This is the permanent home for
your operating system software

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.240
and all those precious files.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.870
Data stays here even
when the computer is off.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.480
The motherboard is the main circuit board,
the master connector that allows all

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.640
these other parts to talk to each other.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.580
Think of it as the central nervous system.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:52.554
We also have input devices which you use
to feed data into the computer, like a

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:55.705
keyboard, mouse, scanner, or microphone.

00:01:56.155 --> 00:02:00.685
And to get information back out,
we use output devices like a

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.054
monitor, printer or speakers.

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:07.545
The graphics processing Unit is
a specialized circuit designed to

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:09.975
rapidly handle images for your screen.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:15.795
Finally, the power supply Unit PSU is
the component that takes power from

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:20.834
the wall and converts it into the right
voltage for all the other parts to use.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.260
Real world relevance.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.280
Now you might ask, sir, why
do I need to know this ra?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.510
It's very useful.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.530
Understanding computer hardware
helps professionals troubleshoot

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.460
basic system issues and use
banking software more efficiently.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.830
Ensuring smooth daily operations for
troubleshooting, you can identify and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.750
resolve hardware problems quickly.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.940
For performance, you can optimize
your system for better productivity.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.100
For decision making, you can make smart
choices when buying or upgrading systems.

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.059
And for data management, you
can handle customer data and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.769
transactions more effectively.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.855
Breakdown of question types based
on what you'll see in your exam.

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:05.945
Questions on this topic
fall into a few categories.

00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:10.805
About 40% of questions are all
about identification of components

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.375
asking you to name apart from
its description or picture.

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:18.845
Around 30% are on functionality
and purpose testing.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.380
If you know what a specific
component actually does.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.599
Another 15% will be on examples of devices
where you'll have to classify something

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.329
as an input output or storage device.

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:36.029
Roughly 10% will cover memory and
storage concepts like the types of memory

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.439
storage units from bits to terabytes
and the differences between them.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.480
The final 5% is on interconnection
and ports dealing with how things

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.420
connect, like via USB or HDMI.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:52.234
Formulas and tricks for computer hardware.

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:54.364
Forget about mathematical formulas.

00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:58.984
Instead, focus on these clever
memory tricks and key facts to

00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:00.994
distinguish input versus output.

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:05.945
Just think in for data bowing into
the computer, like from a keyboard

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:11.314
or mouse and out for data coming
out like on a monitor or printer.

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:14.075
For volatile versus non-volatile memory.

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:20.255
Remember this little rhyme ram is random
and remembers data randomly, meaning

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.165
only when power is on, so it's volatile.

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:27.755
But RO is read only memory and
maintains data even with no

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.945
power, so it's non-volatile.

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:33.935
And here's the storage hierarchy
from fastest to slowest.

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:40.085
It starts with CPU registers,
then cash, Ram, S-S-D-H-D.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.340
Optical drives.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.200
And finally, magnetic tape.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.560
And please, please
remember your memory units.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.790
One nibble is four bits,
one byte is eight bits.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.620
Then we climb the ladder.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.360
One kilobyte or KB is 1 0 2 4 bytes,
one megabyte or MB is 1 0 2 4K.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.580
One gigabyte or GB is 1 0 2 4 MB
and one terabyte or TB is 1 0 2 4

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.860
gb and it keeps going up from there.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:13.925
Methods of solving.

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:17.255
When you face a question,
use these methods.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:21.245
First is direct recall for
identifying a component.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.435
You just pull the answer from your brain.

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:26.195
Next is function-based classification.

00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:30.905
If asked to categorize a device,
just think, does it put information

00:05:30.905 --> 00:05:35.315
in, get information out, or
store it for multiple choice?

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.635
Use elimination.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:40.805
If you're not sure, get rid of the
answers that are definitely wrong.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.760
With contextual understanding, you can
figure out port questions by thinking

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.340
about what devices usually plug in there.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.620
And for comparison questions like
RAM versus Rom use comparison and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.180
contrast by looking at their key
features like speed and volatility.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.440
Shortcuts and smart techniques
want some smart techniques.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.300
Use acronym expansion.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.820
Knowing CPU RAM or SSD in full
form often reveals their function.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.860
Use visual association.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.770
Try to picture the parts inside
a computer to help you remember.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.440
Look for keywords.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.650
Temporary storage almost always means ram.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.050
Brain of the computer is your CPU, and
try to trace the process flow of data

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.810
mentally from input to CPU for processing,
to memory, for temporary holding, to

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.330
storage for saving, and finally to output
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.320
All right.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.480
Let's talk about the common traps.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.900
A big one is confusing RAM and storage.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.650
Many people think RAM is
where files are saved forever.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.650
No, RAM is a temporary workspace.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.340
Your HDD or SSD is for permanent storage.

00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:58.395
Then there's the input
versus output mix up.

00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:03.885
For example, not realizing a touch screen
is both an input and an output device.

00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:08.745
Another one is thinking the CPU versus
the computer are the same thing.

00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:12.675
The CPU is just one vital
part inside the computer.

00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:15.825
Also, be careful with units of memory.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.895
Don't mix bits and bites.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.370
Remember, one byte equals eight bits,
and the biggest misconception that

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.380
software is hardware, software is
just a set of intangible instructions.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.030
Hardware is the physical machine
itself, WH framework summary.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.630
So to summarize it all
quickly, what is it?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.210
The physical, tangible
parts of a computer.

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:40.585
Why is it needed?

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.975
It provides the physical
foundation for software to run.

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:45.385
When is it used?

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:49.795
Well, whenever a computer is
used, built or fixed, where is it

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:53.635
found In every computing device
from your PC to your phone.

00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:54.805
Who uses it?

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:59.335
Everyone who interacts with the
digital device And how does it work?

00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:03.355
The components interact via
electrical signals to process,

00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:05.365
store, and transmit information.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.320
Fully worked out examples.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.910
Let's try a question.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.130
Example, one question.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.600
Which of the following is a volatile
memory that temporarily stores data

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.240
and programs currently being used
by the CPUA hard disk drive edge dd.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.910
B, read only memory rom C, random
access memory, Ram D. Solid state drive.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.120
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.099
Okay, let's solve this.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.209
The keywords are volatile memory
and temporarily stores data.

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:40.780
Volatile means the data
disappears when the power is off.

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:42.409
Let's check the options.

00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:45.170
And HDD is non-volatile storage.

00:08:45.349 --> 00:08:48.139
Incorrect ROM is also non-volatile.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:53.060
Incorrect ram is indeed volatile
memory used as the computer's

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.949
short-term workspace, correct.

00:08:55.249 --> 00:08:58.699
And SSD is also non-volatile
storage incorrect.

00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:03.649
So the answer is clearly C,
answer C, random access memory.

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:04.849
Example two.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.760
Question, which of the following is
primarily considered an output device?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.589
A keyboard.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.290
B Mouse, C Microphone, D monitor.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.800
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.719
All right.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.930
This one is about input versus output.

00:09:27.439 --> 00:09:30.530
Input devices send data to the computer.

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.130
Output devices receive
data from the computer.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.819
A keyboard sends text commands in input.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.459
A mouse sends cursor commands in.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.300
Input.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.630
A microphone sends sound in input.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.740
A monitor displays visual
information out output.

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:53.540
So the only one that is primarily
an output device here is the

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.900
monitor Answer D Monitor.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.689
Example three question.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.640
What is the main function of the central
processing unit in a computer system?

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.150
A to store large amounts
of data permanently.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.060
B to display visual output to the user.

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:16.380
C to execute instructions
and perform calculations.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.910
D, to provide temporary storage
for active programs and data.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.270
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.110
Let's crack this final one.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.830
We need the main function
of the CPU, the brain.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.930
Let's evaluate our choices.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.000
Storing data permanently.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.590
That's the job of an HDD
or SSD displaying output.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.060
That's the monitor's job.

00:10:41.624 --> 00:10:43.274
Providing temporary storage.

00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:44.864
That's what RAM does.

00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:48.194
Executing instructions and
performing calculations.

00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:51.734
Yes, that is the
fundamental role of the CPU.

00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:57.254
It's the engine that runs the
whole show answer, see to execute

00:10:57.254 --> 00:10:59.594
instructions and perform calculations.

00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:00.644
Thank you.

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:01.920
See you in the next lecture.
