Welcome my friend to
today's lecture on memory.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.640
Let's unpack the mystery of this concept
without needing a PhD or a panic attack.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.490
Concept explanation.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.050
Computer memory is essentially
a computer's short-term and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.550
long-term storage space.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
It's where the computer holds data and
instructions that it needs to access

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.170
quickly or keep for a longer period.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.880
Imagine it as the computer's brain
where it keeps things it's actively

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
working on like your thoughts while
solving a problem, and also stores

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
information it needs to remember for
later, like facts you've learned.

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:41.714
There are two main types
of memory you must know.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:45.135
First is primary memory or main memory.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.075
This is the computer's
immediate workspace.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:52.185
It's very fast, but usually
temporary, like a scribbling pad.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:57.165
When the computer is turned off, the
data in most primary memory is lost.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.254
Examples include ram and cache memory.

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:04.855
The second type is secondary memory,
also called auxiliary memory.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.755
This is for your long-term
storage, like a big filing cabinet.

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:12.535
It's slower than primary memory,
but can store much larger

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.095
amounts of data permanently.

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:17.365
Data remains even when the
computer is turned off.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:21.535
Examples include your hard disk
drives, solid state drives,

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.385
USB drives, and even old CDs.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.140
Memory is organized in a hierarchy
based on speed, cost, and capacity.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.910
The rule is simple, faster memory
is typically more expensive and has

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.380
less space while slower memory is
cheaper and has higher capacity.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.210
Real world relevance.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.535
Now you might ask, sir,
why is this important?

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.545
Understanding computer memory is
crucial as it impacts system performance

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:51.945
and data management in so many ways.

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:56.235
It influences the data processing
speed, which is how quickly

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.945
your transactions are processed.

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:02.445
It affects application performance,
ensuring your banking software

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.035
runs smoothly without hanging.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.370
It is all about data storage,
meaning where precious customer

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.380
records and financial data reside.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.440
It is also key for system reliability.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.770
Ensuring data is not
lost during operations.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.300
It even touches security,
helping us understand how data is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.130
accessed and protected in memory.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.900
And finally, it informs your upgrade
decisions, helping you decide on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.550
hardware improvements for better
efficiency, breakdown of question types.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.980
Based on typical patterns in
your exam, questions on memory

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.290
often fall into a few categories.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.470
About 35% of the questions are about
definitions and characteristics, asking

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.709
you to define terms like Ram ro cache,
or identify if they are volatile or not.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.440
Around 25% of questions will test your
understanding of the memory hierarchy.

00:02:57.905 --> 00:03:01.774
Maybe asking you to order
memory types by speed or cost.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:08.165
Another 20% will be on types and
examples, asking you to identify specific

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:11.045
examples of primary or secondary memory.

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:16.415
A smaller 10% of questions will
involve memory units asking for

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:22.520
conversions between bits, bytes,
kb, and mb. And the last 10% will be

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.310
about functions slash purpose testing.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.100
Your knowledge of the role
of different memory types.

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:34.184
Formulas and tricks for
memory unit conversions.

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:35.714
You must remember these.

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:37.904
One byte is eight bits.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:42.135
One kilobyte or KB is 1 0 2 4 bytes.

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:50.234
One megabyte or MB is 1 0 2 4 kb
one gigabyte or GB is 1 0 2 4 M.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.950
One terabyte or KB is 1 0 2 4 GB and
one petabyte or PB is 1 0 2 4 tb.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.020
A great trick for the hierarchy is
to just remember the phrase, CPU

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.630
cache Ram, HDD, for decreasing speed
and cost and increasing capacity.

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:13.615
For unit conversions, the
trick is to convert from a

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.475
smaller unit to a larger one.

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:20.725
You divide by 1 0 2 4 to convert
from a larger unit to a smaller one.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.690
You multiply by 1 0 2 4.

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:27.914
Methods of solving to solve problems.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:31.604
Here are some methods for
identifying memory types.

00:04:31.784 --> 00:04:37.484
Ask yourself if it's volatile, meaning
data is lost on power off or non-volatile.

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:42.674
Is it primary meaning directly
accessible by the CPU or secondary?

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:48.235
For memory unit conversion, just
apply the rule divide by 1 0 2 4 to

00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:53.365
go up to a larger unit and multiply
by 1 0 2 4 to go down to a smaller

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.825
unit to apply hierarchy knowledge.

00:04:55.975 --> 00:05:01.975
Just recall its position memory closer
to the CPU is faster and coster, but

00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:07.855
smaller memory further away is slower and
cheaper, but has a much larger capacity.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.160
Shortcuts and smart techniques.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.100
Here are some smart techniques to make you
faster for volatile versus non-volatile.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.340
Just remember, RAM is random access.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.260
It's randomly volatile, and
ROM is read only, so it must

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.270
be permanent or non-volatile.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.160
Think of cache as a small, super
fast waiting room for data.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.820
The CPU uses all the time
making things quicker.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.880
For the math, recognize that 10 24
is simply due to the power of 10.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.830
This helps in quick mental calculations
and in multiple choice questions.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.790
Always use the elimination
method to discard options

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.590
that are clearly incorrect.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.400
Common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.160
Please avoid these common mistakes.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.830
Many friends confuse RAM and Rom.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.930
RAM is for active data and is
volatile Rom is for boot up

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.970
instructions and is non-volatile.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.490
Don't misunderstand cash.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.030
It is a type of primary
memory, not secondary.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.600
It's smaller and much
faster than the main ram.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.270
A very common mistake is using
thousand for unit conversions

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.120
instead of 10 24, and please don't
mix up primary and secondary memory.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.039
Primary is for direct CPU
Access and is mostly temporary.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.000
Secondary is for long-term
storage and is permanent.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.330
Lastly, believing more RAM always means
faster processing is not entirely true.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.910
The speed of the RAM itself and the CPU's
ability to use it are also critical.

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:53.295
WH framework summary.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:56.895
So to summarize it all, what is memory?

00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:59.805
It's the digital storage
space in a computer.

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:03.885
Why do we have it to store
data and instructions for

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.685
processing and future use.

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:10.965
When is it used continuously during
the computers entire operation.

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:12.555
Where is it located?

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:16.600
Within hardware components
like chips, disks, and drives.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.930
Who uses it every part of the system.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.450
Users, software, and hardware.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.070
And how does it work?

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.440
Through electronic circuits for primary
memory or via magnetic optical or

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.479
flash media for secondary memory.

00:07:32.565 --> 00:07:34.455
Fully worked out examples.

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:36.375
Let's try an example.

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:37.455
Example.

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:38.925
One question.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:42.885
Which of the following is an
example of volatile memory?

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:45.075
A hard disc drive.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.165
B. Read only memory rom.

00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:50.295
C. Random access.

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:50.805
Memory.

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:53.715
Ram D. Solid state drive.

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:57.960
S, s, D understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:07:59.715 --> 00:08:01.515
Okay, let's solve this.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:06.165
Step one first, understand
what volatile memory means.

00:08:06.495 --> 00:08:09.915
Volatile memory needs power
to keep the information.

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:12.705
When power is off, the data is gone.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.735
Step two, let's look at the options.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:19.905
A hard disk drive is secondary
storage and non-volatile.

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:23.385
B ROM is also non-volatile.

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:24.765
It keeps its data.

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:29.265
D, solid state drive is also
secondary and non-volatile.

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:35.955
Step three, that leaves us with C,
random access memory data in ram is

00:08:35.955 --> 00:08:38.175
lost when the computer is turned off.

00:08:38.595 --> 00:08:40.695
This perfectly fits our definition.

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:46.469
So the correct answer is
C. Example two question.

00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:50.760
Arrange the following memory types
in decreasing order of their speed.

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:53.130
One CPU registers.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:53.760
Two.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.219
Main memory, Ram three.

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:57.329
Cache memory.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.959
Four.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.250
Hard disc drive.

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:01.620
A 1, 3, 2, 4.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.890
B three.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:08.050
1, 2, 4, C. 1, 2, 3, 4, D, 4, 2, 3, 1.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.530
Understand the question
before moving to explanation.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.990
All right, let's break it down.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.820
Step one, we need to understand the
memory hierarchy based on speed.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.480
The closer the memory is to
the CPU, the faster it is.

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:25.640
Step two, let's rank our options.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.949
CPU registers are inside the CPU,
so they are the fastest cache.

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:37.040
Memory is next, sitting between the CPU
and ram main memory or RAM is third.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.620
And finally, the hard disk drive.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.515
A secondary storage device
is the slowest of the lot.

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:44.105
Step three.

00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:48.995
So the order from fastest to
slowest is CPU registers, then

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:54.005
cache memory, then main memory,
ram, and then the hard disk drive.

00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:58.595
Step four, this sequence
corresponds to 1, 3, 2, 4.

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:03.454
So the correct option is
a example three question.

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:07.805
How many kilobytes KB are
there in two gigabytes gb?

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:20.939
A 2048 KB B 20 lack 48,000 KB C 20 lack
97,152 KB D 2000 kb. Understand the

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:23.189
question before moving to explanation.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.689
All right, let's do some math.

00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:29.245
Step one, we need to recall
our conversion factors.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:35.995
One GB is 1 0 2 4 MB and one
MB is 1 0 2 4 kb. Step two.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:42.355
First, let's convert two GB into mb.
That is two multiplied by 1 0 2 4,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.835
which gives us 2048 mb. Step three.

00:10:46.165 --> 00:10:49.225
Now we convert these
megabytes into kilobytes.

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:54.020
So we take 2048 and
multiply it by 1 0 2 4.

00:10:54.319 --> 00:11:03.140
Step four, the result of 2048 times
1 0 2 4 is 20, lack 97,152 step five.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.930
Therefore, there are 20 lack
97,000 1 52 KB in two gb.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.640
The correct answer is see.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.600
Thank you.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.160
See you in the next lecture.
